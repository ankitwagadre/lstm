NCE in a great while, a book appears that both embodies and 

dramatically extends centuries of accumulated wisdom in a 

particular discipline, and, at the same time, radically challenges the 
intellectual and political consensus of the day. Human Action by 
Ludwigvon ~Mises (1881-1973) is such a book, and more: a compre- 
hensive treatise on economic science that would lay the foundation 
for a massive shift in intellectual opinion that is still working itself 
out fifty years after publication. Not even such milestones in the 
history of economic thought as Adam Smith's Wealth ofNations, 
Alfred Marshall's Principles, Karl Marx's Capital,or John Maynard 
Keynes's General The09 can be said to have such enduring signifi- 
cance and embody such persuasive power that today's students and 
scholars, as much as those who read it when it first appeared, are 
so fully drawn into the author's way of thinking. For this reason, 
and others discussed below, this Scholar's Edition is the original 
1949 magnum opus that represents such a critical turning point in 
the history of ideas, reproduced (with a 1954 index produced by 
Vernelia Crawford) for the fiftieth anniversary of its initial appear- 
ance. 

When Human Action first appeared, its distinctive Austrian 
SchooI approach was already considered a closed chapter in the 
history of thought. First, its monetary and business cycle theory, 
pioneered by Mises in 19 12' and extended and applied in the 1920s 
and 193 OS,~had been buried by the appearance of Keynes's General

Theory, which gave a facile but appealing explanation of the lingering 
global depression. Second, Mises's 1920demonstration that a socialist 
economy was incapable of rational economic calculation4 sparked a 
long debate in which the "market socialists" had been widely 
perceived to be the eventual victors5 (in part because it became a 
debate among Walrasians6). Third, and fatal for the theoretical core 
of the Austrian School, was the displacement of its theory of price, 
as originated by Carl Menger in 1871' and elaborated upon by Eugen 
von Bohm-Bawerk, John Bates Clark, Philip H. Wicksteed, Frankk 
Fetter, and Herbert J. Da~en~ort.~

Another strain had begun to 
develop along the lines spelled out by Menger's other student 
Friedrich von Wieser, who followed the Walrasian path of de- 
veloping price theory within the framework of general equilibrium. 
Wieser was the primary influence on two members of the third 
generation of the Austrian School, Hans Mayer and Joseph A. 
~chum~eter.' 

Members of the fourth generation, including Oskar Lhlorgenstern, 
Gottfi-ied von Haberler, Fritz Machlup, and Friedrich k von Hayek, 
also tended to follow the Wieserian approach. The crucial influ- 
ence on this generation had been Schurnpeter's treatise Das Wesen 
und derHauptinhaltdm Theoretischen Nationalokonomie, published in

Introduction to the Scholar's Edition 

1908."This bookwas a general treatment ofthe methodological and 
theoretical issues of price theory from a Walrasian perspective. Apart 
from Wieser's writings, it was the only "Austrian" workofpure theory 
to appear prior to Mises's Nationalokonomie, the German-language 
predecessor to Human Action. For the young economists studying 
in Vienna, and despite criticisms by Bohrn-Bawerk, Schumpeter's 
book became a guide to the future of the science. As Morgenstern said, 
"the work was read avidly in Vienna even long after the First World 
War, and its youthful freshness and vigor appealed to the young 
studen ts.... [Llike many others in my generation I resolved to read 
everything Schumpeter had written and would ever write."" 

After Bohm-Bawerk's death in 19 14, no full-time faculty member 
at the University of Vienna was working stricdy within a Mengerian 
framework, while Mises's status as a Privatdozent diminished his 
academic standing. Prior to the geographical dispersal of the school 
in the mid-1930s,12 moreover, none of the members of these latter 
generations had achieved international recognition, particularly 
among English-speaking economists, on the order of Bohm-Baw- 
erk. After the retirement of Clark, Wicksteed, Fetter, and Davenport 
from the debate on pure theory by 1920, the School's influence on 
the mainstream of Anglo-American economics declined precipi- 
tously. This left the field of high theory, particularly in the United 
States, completely open to a Marshallian ascendancy. 

In Germany, the long night of domination by the anti-theoreti- 
cal German Historical School was coming to an end, but the book 
that reawakened the theoretical curiosity of German economists after 
the First World War was Gustav Cassel's Theoretische Sozialokonomie, 
which offered a verbal rendition of Walrasian price theory.13 In the 
Romance countries of France and Italy, Mengerian price theory never

achieved a firm foothold and, by the 1920s, it had been shunted 
aside by the Lausanne School and Marshallian-style neoclassicism. 
By the rnid- 193Os, the Austrian School had melted away in Ausma as 
more attractive prospects abroad or the looming National Socialist 
threat drove the leading Austrian economists to emigrate to Great 
Britain (Hayek), the United States (Machlup, Haberler, and LMor- 
genstern), and Switzerland (Mises). Hayek was well positioned to spark 
a revival of Mengerian theory in Great Britain, but having been a 
student of Wieser rather than ~iihm-~awerk,'~ 

he saw the core of 
economics as the "pure logic of choice," which could be represented 
by the timeless equations of general equilibrium.15 In the end, 
Walrasian general equilibrium theory was imported into Great 
Britain by John R. Hicks under Hayek's influence.'" 

In addition, analytical deficiencies internal to the pre-Misesian 
approach contributed to the sharp decline of the Austrian School 
after the First World War. The Austrians themselves lacked the 
analyucal wherewithal to demonstrate that the timeless and mon- 
eyless general equilibrium approach and the one-at-a-time Mar- 
shallian approach-the analytical pyrotechnics of the 1930s 
notwithstanding-are both plainly and profoundly irrelevant to a 

must look to a foreigner, the Swede Gustav Cassel, for a principled explanation 
of the problems of economic life." Ludwig von Mises, "Carl Menger and the

branches of the Austrian School," the Bohm-Bawerkian and the Wieserian, 
and characterized himself as an adherent of the latter branch. See F.A. Hayek,

himself regarded the analysis of value theory in Hick's Value and Capital in terms 
of marginal rates of substitution and indifference curves as "the ultimate

central problem of economic theory: explaining how monetary 
exchange gives rise to the processes of economic calculation that are 
essential to rational resource allocation in a dynamic world." Thus, 
after a period of remarkable development and influence from 1871 
to 1914,by the early 1930s the Austrian School was on the edge of 
extinction. 

Mises was fully cognizant of this unfortunate state of affairs 
when he emigrated to Switzerland in 1934. Ensconced at the 
Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, for the first 
time he could fully focus his attention on academic research. Mises 
used this opportunity to write Nntionalokonmie, a book that in- 
tended to revive the Mengerian approach and elaborate it into a 
complete and unified system. As evidence of the importance that 
Mises attached to this book, and of the time and energy he poured 
into it, he wrote very little else in the years leading up to its 
publication in 1940.Previously an enormously prolific writer, the 
extent of his output from 1934 to 1939 was comparatively meager: 
in addition to book reviews, short memos, newspaper and maga- 
zine articles, notes, and introductions, there was only one substan- 
tial article for an academic audience.18 

Retrospectively describing his purpose in writing XatimaZokono- 
mie, Mises left no doubt that he sought to address the two burning 
issues left unresolved by the founders of the Austrian School: the 
status of the equilibrium construct and the bifurcation of monetary 
and value theory. "I try in my treatise," Mises wrote, "to consider 
the concept of static equilibrium as instrumental only and to make 
use of this purely hypothetical abstraction only as a means of ap- 
proaching an understanding of a continuously changing world."" 
Regarding his effort to incorporate money into the older Austrian 
theoretical system, -ises identified his immediate inspiration as his

opponents in the socialist calculation debate of the 1930s. These 
economic theorists, under the influence of the general equilibrium 
approach, advocated the mathematical solution to the problem of 
socialist calculation. As Mises argued: "They failed to see the very 
first challenge: How can economic action that always consists of 
preferring and setting aside, that is, of making unequal valuations, 
be transformed into equal valuations, and the use of equations?'do 

But without an adequate theory of monetary calculation, which 
ultimately rests upon a unified theory of a money-exchange econ- 
omy, Mises realized that there could be no definitive refutation of 
the socialist position. Accordingly, Mises revealed: "LVationalokono-
mie finally afforded me the opportunity to present the problems 
of economic calculation in their full significance .... I had merged 
the theory of indirect exchange with that of direct exchange into 
a coherent system of human a~tion."~' 

Thus, Nationalb2onomie marked the culmination of the Austrian 
theoretical approach, and, in a real sense, the rebirth of the 
Austrian SchooI of economics. It was designed to play a decisive 
role in reconstructing the whole of economic science in its moment 
of crisis, including reformulating and unifylng price theory, mone- 
tary theory, and business cycle theory, and at the same time 
establishing the correct methodological foundations of the social 
sciences. Using this mighty architectonic of economic theory, 
Mises formulated a radical and impermeable defense of laissez- 
faire policy conclusions that were distinctly unfashionable when 
the book first appeared. 

M

ISES was uniquely prepared to undertake such a radical task 
Beginning in 1912, during a long tenure as economic advisor 
and chief economist of the Vienna Chamber of Commerce, Mises 
produced a steady stream of works in economic and political 
theory. The publication of his first treatise, Theorie des Geldes und

der Umlaufmittel(19 12) was followed by Nation, Staat und Wirt- 
schafi (1 9 19), Die Gemeinwirtschaf2 (1922), Liberalismw (1927), 
Geldwertstabilisierzlng and Konjunktulpolitik (192€9,Kritik des Inter- 
ventionism~(1929), and Grundprobleme der Nationaliikonomie 
(1933).*' Among the professional public, these works earned Mises a 
reputation as a leading monetary theorist and defender of the gold 
standard, and as an outstanding critic of socialism and proponent of 
laissez-faire capitalism. In academia, he was also recognized as the 
heir to the intellectual tradition of ~Menger and Bohrn-Bawerk, and 
a leading defender of the deductive method in the social sciences 
against the claims of historicists. However, outside the circle of the 
participants in his Privatsmina7;the ('Misq-Ki-eis, ''j the philosophical 
depth and systematic breadth of Mises's work was rarely acknow- 
ledged or recognized. Even his students and friends, who beginning 
in 1920 met regularly every two weeks in his Chamber of Com- 
merce office, had at best only an inkling of ,Wses's systematic 
ambition. From book to book, they witnessed the appearance of the 
successive building blocks of a Misesian system. But when Mises left 
Vienna in 1934 to move to Geneva, even they could not have had 
more than a vague notion of how to fit these pieces into a unified 
whole. Mises was fifty-eight years old when Nationalbkonomie: 

Theorie des Handelm and Wirts~haftens~~ 

appeared. It was Mises's 
crowning intellectual achievement and the sum of his scholarly 
life. At long last, this book should have established him as the 
foremost German-language economist and social theorist of his 
generation.

Mises's masterwork, however, appeared in the midst of political and 
personal crisis. After the Anscblzlss on March 12, 1938, Mises could 
no longer travel to Austria. His apartment in Vienna had been 
ransacked by National Socialists and his library and personal papers 
c~nfiscated.~'By June 1940, German troops had virtually encircled 
Switzerland, and, urged by his wife, Mises decided to leave Geneva 
and emigrate to the United States. "I could no longer bear," he 
explained in his Erinnmngen written shortly after his arrival in New 
York City on August 4, 1940, "to live in a country that regarded 
my presence as a political burden and danger to its security."26 

From the outset, the book was cut off almost completely from 
the German market, and its Swiss publisher would become one of 
the countless economic casualties of war. Meanwhile, almost all 
members of the former Afises-kieis had likewise left Austria and 
emigrated to other countries. In their new, foreign, and uncertain 
environment, they paid little or no attention to it. Thus, Nation- 
alokonomie remained virtually unread." What should have been a 
moment of immense satisfaction and even triumph, a moment 
which might have brought about a shift away from the growing 

~e~nesiadWalrasian-~arshallian


consensus, and even inocu- 
lated the profession against the positivist onslaught of later dec- 
ades, became for LI/Iises a moment of tragedy and likely the lowest 
point in his career. 

Nine more years would pass until, with the publication of 
Human Action, Mises would reap some of the rewards that had

escaped him in 1940.~' Yale University Press, headed by Eugene 
Davidson, had published Mises's Omnipotent Government and Bu-
reaucracy in 1944, on the recommendation of Henry Hazlitt, who 
was then working for the New York Times as an editorial writer. The 
success of these works prompted Davidson to send a note to Mises 
in mid-November that would set the process in motion. Mises and 
Davidson met on Monday, December 4, at the Roosevelt Hotel 
for lunch, and made plans for a translation of Nationalokonornie, 
under the working title Treatise in Economics. Davidson found the 
idea enticing and solicited further opinions on the matter from a 
variety of economists and public figures. 

Hazlitt recommended immediate publication, as did John V. 
Van Sickle of Vanderbilt University ("I hope you will decide on 

publication"*^, Ray Bert Westerfield of Yale University ("a first- 
rate bookn3?, Hayek ("the general standard of the workis of a kind 
that it will do credit to any University Pressn3'), andMachlup (who, 
with effusive praise for Mises, encouraged Davidson to ignore all 
protests against publication; any book "out of sympathy with the 
New Deal in economics" would be opposed by the same people'2). 
Haberler, however, wrote, "It is a little embarrassing for me to 
answer your question because Professor Mises is a good friend of 
mine. Please do keep the contents of this letter strictly confidential. 
The book you are considering for translation is a very big one. It 
contains Professor Mises's life work in economics. It is well written 
and interesting but I must say for my taste it is very extreme, and 
I am pretty sure it will not be well accepted in academic quarters .... 
May I suggest that you ask Professor Knight of the University of 
Chicago for his opinion?"33 

28. As the result of the continued success of Human Action, forty years 
after its initial publication Mises's Natimliikmumie was reprinted (Munich: 
Philosophia, 1980). Unlike the original, the reprint received widespread 
attention, including reviews in the two leadin German language newspapers, 
the Frankfirter All emeine Zeitung (by Wilhe 7m Seuss) and the Neue Zuercher 
Zeimng (by Egon 'fuchtfeldt).

Yale then consulted Frank H. Knight, who wrote back that Mises 
is "no doubt the last of the great Austrian or Viennese school, since 
other members of comparable standing turned their scientific along 
with their political coats, if they did not leave Ausaia and Germany, 
and started work on new problems under new auspices .... It is my 
impression-not based on adequate knowledgethat the author's 
views on monetary and cycle problems are more important than those 
on general theory." In an addendum, Knight says he in turn consulted 
Oskar Lange (one of Mises's leading opponents in the socialist 
calculation debate) who was "surely not more in favor of the project. 
He thinks vonMises did some pioneering at one time in the monetary 
field but that is old andlong available in ~n~lish."~~In 

addition, B.H. 
Beckhart, a former student of Mises's teaching at Columbia Univer- 
sity, wrote a terse reply to Davidson: "I doubt if Professor Mises's work 
would have a sufficiently wide sale to justify its translation or publi- 
cation. Professor Mises's theories are developed rather fully in his 
works which have already appeared in English."35 

Despite the protests, Yale's Committee on Publications voted to 
approve the publication March 5, 1945, under the working title 
National Economy, which would become Human Action just prior 
to publication.36 The publisher received the final manuscript on 
October 1,1948. By the time the English-language version appeared, 
circumstances were no longer conducive to an early renewal of the 
Austrian School. ~eadershi~ 

in pure economic theory had passed 
from Europe to the United States, in part because of the migration 
of many Central European economists to America. Marshallian price 
theory in various forms had dominated the textbook literature and 
undergraduate teaching in the United States since the 1920s, and this 
dominance was strengthened by the widespread interest in the doctrine 
of imperfect competition in the journals. In addition, the general 
equilibrium approach had secured a firm foothold in the United

on Human Artion, (2) Man and Reality: A Treatise on Human Action, (3) Means 
and En&: A Tmtise on Eccmomics, (4) Man in the Pumit of a Better Life: A 
Treatie on Economics, and (5)Human Action: A Treatzie on Economics. Next to 
this final suggestion, Davidson wrote "Ilike this" but worried that it "doesn't 
make the subject immediately clear."

States economics profession with the publication of Paul Samuel- 
son's Foundations of Economic Analysis in 1947 .37 

In the decades following the appearance of Human Action, it was 
left to Mises's own students, who studied with him while he served as 
an unsalaried professor at New York University from 1945-1969, to 
take up the task of developing, propagating, and extending Austrian 
School theory. Preeminent among these students was Murray N. 
Rothbard, whose Man, Economy, and State in 1 962 ,j8America's Great 
Depression in 1963, and a long series of theoretical and historical 
studies,3Yprepared the groundwork for a full-scale revival of the 
Austrian School in the 1970s (precipitated by F.A. Hayek's Nobel 
Prize in 1974) and the 1980s.~The revival became firmly en- 
trenched and internationalized4' in the 1990swith the establishment 
of scholarly journals dedicated to advancing Misesian economics, and 
a vast and continuing series of papers, conferences, books, teaching 
seminars, and professional meetings."

UMAN ACTIONand Nationaliikonmie have the same overall 
structure of seven parts, and the bulk of the English edition 
consists of material directly translated from the German. However, 
significant differences exist. Human Action is considerably longer, 
and contains numerous additions to its predecessor. There are also 
passages, sections, and chapters in Nationalakonomie which were 
either omitted, shortened, or significantly altered inHuman Action.

Human Action 

The most important addition in Human Ahon is Chapter VI on 
uncertainty. This chapter does not appear in its predecessor, nor is 
its subject matter discussed elsewhere. Here, ,Mses further clarifies 
his earlier epistemological investigations through the introduc- 
tion of the categorical distinction between apodictic certainty (the 
realm of praxeology), class probability (the realm of the natural 
sciences), and case probability (the realm of history). Several 
commentators have noted the similarity of Mises's distinction 
between class probability and case probability and that between risk 
and uncertainty introduced by Knight in Risk, Uncertainty and Profit 
in 1921.43 Yet, it does not appear that Mises was influenced by 
Knight in this regard. Mises had been long familiar with Knight's 
work, and had already made reference to Risk, Uncefiainty and 
Profit in Nationalokonomie in conjunction with his discussion of 
profit and uncertainty? Rather, it appears more likely that MisesS 
Chapter VI was stimulated and influenced by his younger brother, 
Richard von Mises (1883-1953). A professor of aerodynamics and 
applied mathematics at Harvard University, Richard von Mises's 
most outstanding theoretical achievement was his contribution, 
from 1919 onward, to the frequency theory of probability.4s In 
principle, Ludwig accepted Richard's frequency interpretation of 
probability, but Ludwig provided a new definition of randomness, 
and thus significantly improved on Richard's 

Apart from the addition of Chapter VI, all other changes or 
additions to Human Adon from its predecessor can be described as 
non-substantial. Some material is reorganized, the discussion of some 
subjects is expanded or further applications are provided, and there 
are some changes in emphasis or perspective. Most reorganization 
concerns the book's first philosophical parts, i.e., Chapters I and

he commercial success of Human Action exceeded both the 
author's and the publisher's expectations. It was published on 
September 14, 1949; three weeks later, the press was already 
planning the second and even a third printing. In a memo, Chester 
Kerr (who later headed the press when the second edition was 
issued) spoke of sales of "an extraordinary rate for a $10 volume of 
solid reading." In January 1950, it became a Book-of-the-Month 
Club alternate selection. Reviews, as one might expect, were highly 
polarized, with the popular press treating it as the brilliant work 
of a genius, while academic economists (Seymour E. Harris4' and 
John K. GalbraithsO) regarded it as shockingly archaic and insufi- 
ciently pious towards the profession. John Hicks alternately 
praised ("a powerful book") and mocked the book ("~Mises sets up 
Capitalism as a god, which it is sinful to touch"),51 while Ludwig 
Lachmann gave Mises one of his few enthusiastic academic en-

Introduction to the Scholar's Edition 

~miew.'~Regardless of the mixed reception, and contrary to the 

-

widespread opinion that Mises would surely be the last member of 
the Austrian School, Humn Action served as rhe essential foundation 
for the huge and growing free-market political movement and an 
academic movement of Austrian School economists, for which it 
continues to serve as the primary text today. 

The first edition of Humn Action was continuously in print for 
fourteen years. In February 1961,Mises initiated the second revised 
edition of Huwn Ammonin a letter to Ivan Bierly of the Volker Fund, 
a foundation that had supported Mises's teaching and writing. In 
March, Mises wrote the publisher, "It seems to me that now after 
twelve years it is time to publish a new edition, revised in some points 
and slightly enlarged." He informed Yale that he could have the 
changes by the end of the year. Yale Press received the news with 
enthusiasm and waited for Mises's changes. 

What followed was another trial in ~Wses's life. The second edition 
went into production far later than anticipated, which left the pub-
lisher without copies of Human Action for fifteen months. ~Mises was 
never given galley proofs to examine before publication. When the 
second edition finally appeared in May 1963, it was riddled with 
typographical errors. There were missing paragraphs and lines, du- 
plicated lines, and even a duplicated page. There were no running 
heads on the pages and the printing was variously light and dark 
Despite protests, the publisher refused to accept full responsibility, 
which led Mises to secure the services of an attorney. In the defm 
settlement @Gses never accedkd to it entirely), Yale distributed errata 
sheets and agreed to prepare a corrected third edition when the second 
edition sold out. The matter was finally settled when Henry Regnery 
worked to secure the rights for his publishing company in early 1966. 
He reset the book and published the third edition later that year (at 
which time II/Iises was eighty-five years old).547SS

54. The mystery of who precisely was responsible for mangling the treatise 
has never been solved. Margit von Mises, discussing the matter in her memoirs, 
offers this: "the villain in a Perry Mason sto is easy to detect It is always the 
one whom you suspect least and whom the au 2or treats with a certain indulgent 
negligence." My Yearswith Ludwig von Miser (Cedar Falls, Iowa: Center for 
Futures Education, [I9761 1984), p. 11 1. 

Human Action 

Mises left no essay or speech explaining the changes (some of 
them substantial) made to later editions of Human Action. Original 
drafts of manuscripts delivered to the publisher are not available. 
Neither are personal notes available, from Mises or the publisher, or 
information on the precise timing of the changes. Some changes to 
later editions were suggested by Mises's friend Percy L. Greaves, Jr., 
in a memo dated October 12,1961. For instance, Greaves suggested 
that Mises alter the content of paragraph three on page 187, dealing 
with German aggressiveness, to apply to Russia. The paragraph was 
eliminated entirely. Greaves also suggested that the section on Inter- 
national Monetary Cooperation beginning on page 473 "be brought 
up to date." Four paragraphs were added to the end of the original 
(unchanged) section. Referring to immigration, Mises writes on 
pages 820-82 1:"Neither does it mean that there can be any question 
of appeasing aggressors by removing migration barriers. As condi-
tions are today, the Americas and Australia in admitting German, 
Italian, and Japanese immigrants merely open their doors to the 
vanguards of hostile armies." Greaves suggested amending this pas- 
sage, but no change was made in the second edition. For the third 
edition, the passage is eliminated altogether and replaced with an 
additional paragraph calling for a philosophy of mutual cooperation 
to replace the view that there are "irreconcilable antagonisms" be- 
tween groups in society. 

Other notable changes were made to later editions, some of which 
cannot be considered improvements. Pages 796799 of the first 
edition include some insightful remarks about the workings of Ger- 
man exchange controls and international barter agreements in the 
1930s. These comments, cited and built upon in a later historical 
study of the New Deai by ~06bard,'%re entireiy eiiminated from 
subsequent editions. The final two paragraphs on page 563, in which 
Mises sheds light on the relationship between public opinion and an 
inflationary monetary policy, are also eliminated. As a smaller 
matter, for later editions, the section on imperfect competition was 
changed from the 1949 edition, and not with clarifying results. For 

55. The "fourth revised edition" (Irvin on-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation 
for Economic Education, 1996) is the thir c? edition with an expanded index.

Introduction to the Scholar's Edition 

instance, the 1949 edition includes this sentence: "The confusion 
which led to the idea of imperfect or monopolistic competition stems 
from a misinterpretation of the term control ofmpply" (p. 357). Later 
editions change the sentence to introduce ambiguity: "Consider- 
able confusion stems from a misinterpretation of the term control 
of supply. "57 

On monopoly theory, the first edition contains a crucial para- 
graph that was eliminated in subsequent editions, a passage that 
elucidates how far Mises's understanding of the monopoly price 
was from the mainstream neoclassical view. "Monopoly prices," he 
writes in this and later editions, "are the outcome of a deliberate 
design tending toward a restriction of trade" (p. 356). In the 
original edition Mises added an additional paragraph explaining 
what is meant by the word "deliberate." It is only the economist 
who can contrast the competitive price with the monopoly price; 
the businessman, "like every other seller," only wants to realize the 
highest price attainable. With this passage, we gain a deeper 
understanding of Mises's own theory, which is closer to the Roth- 
bardian view that in the actual operation of the free market, there 
is no meaningful way to distinguish between a monopoly and a 
competitive price. Indeed, neither Mises nor Rothbard regarded 
their respective positions on monopoly as in~om~atible.'~ 

One particular change has caused considerable confusion. In 
section XV6, "Freedom," the original edition focuses on the neces- 
sity of curbing government power, and concludes that government 
is "by necessity the opposite of liberty" and is a "barantor of 
liberty and is compatible with liberty only if its range is adequately 
restricted to the preservation of economic freedom" (p. 283).59 

57. Additions in later editions not discussed here includeXVI.6, pars. 5-6 and 
XXVII.6 "Corruption."As further evidence of a general dunning of language 
that takes place in later editions, consider that on page 566, in a discussion of the 
manner in which busts follow artificial booms, the last sentence of the 
continued paragraph ("They are inevitable") was removed. 
58. Mises conveyed this view in private correspondence, and during his 
New York seminar, where he was frequently asked about possible differences 
with Rothbard following the release ofMan, Economy, and State (Bettina Bien 
Greaves's notes, privately held, 1962-1965). 
59. This is consistent with Mises's Liberal&: "Human society cannot do 
without the apparatus of the state, but the whole of mankind's progress has 
had to be achieved against the resistance and opposition of the state and its 

Human Action 

Revised editions preserve that passage with only minor alterations, 
but add seven wholly new paragraphs preceding it. These new 
paragraphs in the revised editions introduce a different focus on the 
necessary and specific powers of government, which appear rather 
expansive by Misesian standards: "The maintenance of a govern-
ment apparatus of courts, police officers, prison, and of armed 
forces requires considerable expenditure. To levy taxes for these 
purposes is fully compatible with the freedom the individual enjoys 
in a free market economy" (third ed., p. 282). 

Also, these later editions substantially alter the definition of free- 
dom itself. In the original, Mises states: "Aman is free as far as he can 
live and get on without being at the mercy of arbitrary decisions on the 
part of other people" (p. 279). Mises does not define "arbitrary," but 
he appears to have in mind actions that infringe on someone's person 
or property without his agreement. Revised editions, in contrast, 
state: "we may define freedom as that state of affairs in which the 
individual's decision to choose is not constrained by governmental 
violence beyond the margin which the praxeological law restricts it 
anyway" (third ed., p. 282). The phrase "praxeological law" (meaning 
the law of cause and effect in human affairs) works here as qualifier; 
it is so 'expansively applied that any government activity, however 
arbitrary, that is said to preserve or achieve "freedom" might be 
deemed permissible. The original definition, more specific and smn- 
gent, rules out arbitrary interventions altogether. 

Thus, these added passages in later editions go even further to 
permit conscription, and it is here we find a direct inconsistency 
withMises's prior writings. In particular, the passage is at odds with 
Mises's defense of secession, which he elevated to the rank of a core 
principle of the liberal program, as explained in Nation, State, and 
Economy in 191960 and even more emphatically in Liberalism in 
1927." If every person is entitled to secede from the state then the 

ower of coercion. No wonder that all who have had something new to offer 
Eumanity have had nothing good to say of the state or its laws!" (San 
Francisco: Cobden Press, [I9271 1985), p. 58. 

60. "No people and no part of a people shall be held against its will in a 
political association that it does not want." Nation, State, and Economy (New 
York University Press, [I91 91 1 983), p. 65. 
61. For Mises, the only possible objections to unlimited secession were 
practical or technical, not principled concerns. Liberalism, pp. 109-1 10. 

Introduction to the Scholar's Edition 

state becomes a kind of voluntary organization from which exit is 
always allowed; accordingly, any form of conscription would have 
to be considered illegitimate and impermissible. Even more strik- 
ingly, however, the passage stands in contradiction to the discus- 
sion, and rejection, in Nationalokonomieof conscription as a species 
of interventionism which, according to its own internal "logic," 
leads inevitably to socialism and total war. "Military conscriptjon," 
1Mises wrote, "leads to compulsory public service of everyone capable 
of work. The supreme commander controls the entire people, ... the 
mobilization has become total; people and state have become part 
of the army; war socialism has replaced the market economy."62

building on and expanding its German prede- 

cessor, transformed Austrian economics, as it is understood 
today, into a predominantly American phenomenon with a dis-
tinctly Misesian imprint, and made possible the continuation of 
the Austrian School after the mid-twentieth century. Thus the first 
edition assumes an importance that extends beyond the mere histori- 
cal. It reveals the issues and concerns that Mises considered primary 
when releasing, at the height of his intellectual powers, the most 
complete and integrated statement of his career. In particular, making 
the unchanged first edition available again retrieves important pas- 
sages that were later eiiminated, and clarifies questions raised by 
unnecessary, and, in some cases, unfortunate additions and revisions 
made to later editions. 

That the original edition represents the fullest synthesis of 
Mises's thought on method, theory, and policy, and is the book that 
sustained the Austrian tradition and the integrity of economic 
science after the socialist, Keynesian, Walrasian, Marshallian, and 
positivist conquests of economic thought, is reason enough to reissue 
the original on its fiftleth anniversary, making it widely available for 
the first time in nearly four decades. A high place must be reserved 
in the history of economic thought, indeed, in the history of ideas, 
for ~Wses's masterwork. Even today, Human Action points the way 
to a brighter future for the science of economics and the practice 
of human liberty

K0M the fall of I 934 until the summer of 1940I had the 
privilege of occupying the chair of International Eco- 
nomic Kelations at the Graduate Institute of International 
Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. In the serene atmosphere 
of this seat of learning, which two eminent scholars, Paul 
Mantoux and William E. Kappard, had organized and con- 
tinued to direct, I set about executing an old plan of mine, 
to write a comprehensive treatise on economics. The book- 
Nationalokonomie, Theorie des Handelns zmd Wirtschaftens 
-was published in Geneva in the gIoomy days of May, 19.10. 

The present volume is not a translation of this earlier book. 
Although the general structure has been little changed, all 
parts have been rewritten. 

To my friend Henry Hazlitt I wish to off er my very special 
thanks for his kindness in reading the manuscript and giving 
me most valuable suggestions about it. I must also gratefully 
acknou~ledgemy obligations to Mr. Arthur Coddard for lin- 
guistic and stylistic advice. I am furthcrmore deeply indebted

INTRODUCTION 

I. Economics and Praxeology 
E 
E
CONOMICS is the youngest of all sciences. In the last two hundred 
years, it is true, many new sciences have emerged from the dis- 
ciplines familiar to the ancient Greeks. However, what happened here 
was merely that parts of knowledge which had already found their 
place in the complex of the old system of learning now became au- 
tonomous. The field of study was more nicely subdivided and treated 
with new methods; hitherto unnoticed provinces were discovered 
in it, and people began to see things from aspects different from those 
of their precursors. The field itself was not expanded. But economics 
opened to human science a domain previously inaccessible and never 
thought of. The discovery of a regularity in the sequence and inter- 
dependence of market phenomena went beyond the limits of the 
traditional system of learning. It conveyed knowledge which could 
be regarded neither as logic, mathematics, psychology, physics, nor 
biology. 

Philosophers had long since been eager to ascertair. the ends which 
God or hTature was trying to realize in the course of human history. 
They searched for the law of mankind's destiny and evolution. But 
even those thinkers whose inquiry was free from any theological 
tendency failed utterly in these endeavors because they were com- 
mitted to a faulty method. They dealt with humanity as a whole or 
with other holistic concepts like nation, race, or church. They set up 
quite arbitrarily the ends to which the behavior of such wholes is

regarding what factors compelled the various acting individuals to 
behave in such a way that the goal aimed at by the whole's inexorable 
evolution was attained. They had recourse to desperate shifts: miracu- 
lous interference of the Deity either by revelation or by the delega- 
tion of God-sent prophets and consecrated leaders, preestablished 
harmony, predestination, or the operation of a mystic and fabulous 
"world soul" or "national soul." Others spoke of a "cunning of na- 
ture" which implanted in man impulses driving him unwittinglv along 
precisely the path Nature wanted him to take. 


Human Actioa 

Other philosophers were more reaIistic. They did not try to guess 
the designs of Nature or God. They loolted at human things from 
the viewpoint of government. They were intent upon establishing 
rules of political action, a technique, as it were, of government and 
statesmanship. Speculative minds drew ambitious plans for a thorough 
reform and reconstruction of society. The more modest were satis- 
fied with a collection and systematization of the data of historical 
experience. But all were fully convinced that there was in the course 
of social events no such regularity and invariance of phenomena as 
had already been found in the operation of human reasoning and in 
the sequence of natural phenomena. They did not search for the laws 
of social cooperation because they thought that man coulcl organize 
society as he pleased. If social conditions did not fulfill the wishes 
of the reformers, if their utopias proved unrealizable, the fault was 
seen in the moral failure of man. Social problems were considered 
ethical problems. What was needed in order to construct the ideal 
society, they thought, was good princes and virtuous citizens. With 
righteous men any utopia might be realized. 

'The discovery of the inescapable interdependence of market 
phenomena overthrew this opinion. Bewildered, people had to face 
a new view of society. They learned with stupefaction that there is 
another aspect from khich human action might be viewed than that 
of good and bad, of fair and unfair, of just and unjust. In the course 
of social events there prevails a regularity of phenomena to which 
man must adjust his action if he wishes to succeed. It is futile to ap- 
proach social facts with the attitude of a censor who approves or dis- 
approves from the point of view of quite arbitrary standards and 
subjective judgments of value. One must study the laws of human 
action and social cooperation as the phvsicist studies the laws of 

A, 


nature. Human action and social cooperation seen as the object of a 
science of given relations, no longer as a normative discipline of things 
that ought to be-this was a revolution of tremendous consequences

For more than a hundred years, however, the effects of this radical 
change in the methods of reasoning were greatly restricted because 
people believed that they referred only to a narrow segment of the 
total field of human action, namely, to market phenomena. The clas- 
sical economists met in the pursuit of their investigations an obstacle 
which they failed to remove, the apparent antinomy of value. Their 
theory of value was defective, and forced them to restrict the scope 
of their science. Until the late nineteenth century political economy 
remained a science of the "economic" aspects of human action, a 


theory of wealth and selfishness. It dealt with human action only to 
the extent that it is actuated by what was-very unsatisfactorily-
described as the profit motive, and it asserted that there is in addition 
other human action whose treatment is the task of other disciplines. 
The transformation of thought which the classical economists had 
initiated was brought to its consummation only by modern subjectivist 
economics, which converted the theory of market prices into a 
general theory of human choice. 

For a long time men failed to realize that the transition from the 
classical theory of value to the subjective theory of value was much 
more than the substitution of a more satisfactory theory of market 
exchange for a less satisfactory one. The general theory df choice and 
preference goes far beyond the horizon which encompassed the scope 
of economic problems as circumscribed by the economists from 
Cantillon, Hume, and Adam Srnith down to John Stuart Mill. It 
is much more than merely a theory of the "economic side" of human 
endeavors and of man's striving for commodities and an improve- 
ment in his material well-being. It is the science of every kind of 
human action. Choosing determines all human decisions. In making 
his choice man chooses not only between various material things and 
services. All human values are offered for option. All ends and all 
means, both material and ideal issues, the sublime and the base, the 
noble and the ignoble, are ranged in a single row and subjected to a 
decision which picks out one thing and sets aside another. hTothing 
that Inen aim at or want to avoid remains outside of this arrangement 
into a unique scale of gradation and preference. The modern theory 
of value widens the scientific horizon and enlarges the field of eco- 
nomic studies. Out of the political economy of the classical school 
emerges the general theory of human action, p~axeology.~The eco- 
nomic or catallactic problems are embedded in a more general 
science, and can no longer be severed from this connection. No 
treatment of economic problems proper can avoid starting from acts 
sf &nice; ecnnnmirs hcrnmcs a part, although the hichertn best 
elaborated part, of a more universal scicnce, praxeology. 

I. The term praxeology was first used in 1890 by Espinas. Cf. his article "Les 
Origines de la technologie," Revue Philosophique, XVth year, XXX, I 14-1 I 5, 
and his book published in Paris in 1897, with the same title. 
2. The term Catallactics or the Science of Exchanges was first used by 
WhateIy. Cf. his book Introductory Lectures on Political Economy (London, 
1831)~p. 6. 

Human Action 

2. The Epistemological Problem of a 
General Theory of Human Action 
In the new science everything seemed to be problematic. It was 
a stranger in the traditional system of knowledge; people were per- 
plexed and did not know how to classify it and to assign it its proper 
place. But on the other hand they were convinced that the incIusion 
of economics in the catalogue of knowledge did not require a rear- 
rangement or expansion of the total scheme. They considered their 
catalogue system complete. If economics did not fit into it, the fault 
could only rest with the unsatisfactory treatment that the economists 
applied to their problems. 

It is a complete misunderstanding of the meaning of the debates 
concerning the essence, scope, and logical character of economics to 
dismiss them as the scholastic quibbling of pedantic professors. It is 
a widespread misconception that while pedants squandered useless 
talk about the most appropriate method of procedure, economics 
itself, indifferent to these idle disputes, went quietly on its way. In 
the Methodenstreit between the Austrian economists and the Prus- 
sian Historical School, the self-styled "intellectuaI bodyguard of the 
House of Hohenzollern," and in the discussions between the school 
of John Bates Clark and American Institutionalism much more was 
at stake than the question of what kind of procedure was the most 
fruitful one. The real issue was the epistemological foundations of 
the science of human action and its logical legitimacy. Starting from 
an epistemological system to which praxeological thinking was strange 
and from a logic which acknowledged as scientific-besides logic and 
mathematics--only the empirical natural sciences and history, many 
authors tried to deny the value and usefulness of economic theory. 
Historicism aimed at replacing it by economic history; positivisnl 
recommended the substitution of an illusory social science which 
should adopt the logical structure and pattern of Newtonian mechan- 
ics. Both these schools agreed in a radical rejection of all the achieve- 
ments of economic thought. It was impossible for the economists to 
keep silent in the face of all these attacks. 

The radicalism of this wholesale condemnation of economics was 

very soon surpassed by a still more universal nihilism. From time 

immemorial men in thinking, speaking, and acting had taken the uni- 

formity and immutability of the logical structure of the human mind 

as an unquestionable fact. All scientific inquiry was based on this as- 

sumption. In the discussions about the epistemological character of 

economics, writers, for the first time in human history, denied this 


Introduction 

proposition too. ~Marxism asserts that a man's thinking is determined 
by his class affiliation. Every social class has a logic of its own. The 
product of thought cannot be anything else than an "ideological dis- 
guise" of the selfish class interests of the thinker. It is the task of a 
"sociology of knowledge" to unmask philosophies and scientific 
theories and to expose their "ideological" emptiness. Economics is a 
"bourgeois" makeshift, the economists are "sycophants" of capital. 
Only the classless society of the socialist utopia will substitute truth 
for "ideological" lies. 

This polylogism was later taught in various other forms also. 
Historicism asserts that the logical structure of human thought and 
action is liable to change in the course of historical evolution. Racial 
polylogism assigns to each race a logic of its own. Finally there is 
irrationalism, contending that reason as such is not fit to elucidate 
the irrational forces that determine human behavior. 

Such doctrines go far beyond the limits of economics. They ques- 
tion not only economics and praxeology but all other human knowl- 
edge and human reasoning in general. They refer to mathematics 
and physics as well as to economics. It seems therefore that the task 
of refuting them does not fall to any single branch of knowledge but 
to epistemology and philosophy. This furnishes apparent justifica- 
tion for the attitude of those economists who quietly continue their 
studies without bothering about epistemological problems and the 
objections raised by poIylogism and irrationalism. The physicist does 
not mind if somebody stigmatizes his theories as bourgeois, Western 
or Jewish; in the same way the economist should ignore detraction 
and slander. He should let the dogs bark and pay no heed to their 
yelping. It is seemly for him to remember Spinoza's dictum: Sane 
sicut lux se ipsam et tenebras manifestat, sic veritas norma sui et falsi 
est. 

However, the situation is not quite the same with regard to eco- 

nomics as it is with mathematics and the natural sciences. Polylogism 

and irrationaIism attack praxeology and economics. Although they 

formulate their statements in a general way to refer to all branches 

of knowledge, it is the sciences of human action that they really have 

in view. They say that it is an illusion to believe that scientific re- 

search can achieve results valid for people of all eras, races, and social 

classes, and they take pleasure in disparaging certain physical and 

biological theories as bourgeois or Western. But if the soIution of 

practical problems requires the application of tbese stigmatized doc- 

trines, they forget their criticism. The technology of Soviet Russia 

utilizes without scruple all the results of bourgeois physics, chemistry, 


Human Action 

and biology just as if they were valid for all classes. The Nazi engi- 
neers and physicians did not disdain to utilize the theories, discoveries, 
and inventions of people of "inferior" races and nations. The be- 
havior of people of all races, nations, religions, linguistic groups, and 
social classes clearly proves that they do not endorse the doctrines 
of polylogism and irrationalism as far as logic, mathematics, and 
the natural sciences are concerned. 

But it is quite different with praxeology and economics. The main 
motive for the development of the doctrines of polylogism, histor- 
icism, and irrationalism was to provide a justification for disregarding 
the teachings of economics in the determination of economic policies. 
The socialists, racists, nationalists, and Ctatists failed in their endeavors 
to refute the theories of the economists and to demonstrate the cor- 
rectness of their own spurious doctrines. It was precisely this frustra- 
tion that prompted them to negate the logical and epistemological 
principles upon which all human reasoning both in mundane activities 
and in scientific research is founded. 

It is not permissible to disposc of these objections merely on the 
ground of the political motives which inspired them. No scientist is 
entitled to assume beforehand that a disapprobation of his theories 
must be unfounded because his critics are imbued by passion and party 
bias. He is bound to reply to every censure without any regard to 
its underlying motives or its background. It is no less impermissible 
to keep silent in the face of the often asserted opinion that the theorems 
of economics are valid only under hypothetical assumptions never 
realized in life and that they are therefore useless for the mental grasp 
of reality. It is strange that some schools seem to approve of this 
opinion and nonetheless quietly proceed to draw their curves and to 
formulate their equations. They do not bother about the meaning of 
their reasoning and about its reference to the world of real life and 
action. 

This is, of course, an untenable attitude. The first task of every 

. .

sc:ent:f c ixyiy Is the description and defiiiitioii of a!! 
conditions and assumptions under which its various statements claim 
validity. It is a mistake to set up physics as a model and pattern for 
economic research. But those committed to this fallacy should have 
learned one thing at least: that no physicist ever believed that the 
clarification of some of the assumptions and conditions of physical 
theorems is outside the scope of physical research. The main question 
that economics is bound to answer is what the relation of its state- 
ments is to the reality of human action whose mental grasp is the 
objective of economic studies. 


Introduction 

It therefore devolves upon economics to deal thoroughly with the 
assertion that its teachings are valid only for the capitalist system of 
the shortlived and already vanished liberal period of Western civiliza- 
tion, It is incumbent upon no branch of learning other than economics 
to examine all the objections raised from various points of view against 
the usefulness of the statements of economic theory for the elucida- 
tion of the problems of human action. The system of economic 
thought must be built up in such a way that it is proof against any 
criticism on the part of irrationalism, historicism, panphysicalism, 
behaviorism, and all varieties of polylogism. It is an intolerable state 
of affairs that while new arguments are daily advanced to demon- 
strate the absurdity and futility of the endeavors of economics, the 
economists pretend to ignore all this. 

It is no longer enough to deal with the economic problems within 
the traditional framework. It is necessary to build the theory of 
cataIlactics upon the soiid foundation of a general theory of human 
action, praxeology. This procedure will not only secure it against 
many fallacious criticisms but clarify many problems hitherto not 
even adequately seen, still less satisfactorily solved. There is, espe- 
cially, the fundamental problem of economic calculation. 

3. Economic Theory and the Practice of Human Action 
It is customary for many people to blame economics for being 
backward. Now it is quite obvious that our economic theory is not 
perfect. There is no such thing as perfection in human knowledge, nor 
for that matter in any other human achievement. Omniscience is 
denied to man. The most elaborate theory that seems to satisfy com- 
pletely our thirst for knowledge may one day be amended or sup- 
$anted by a new theory. Science does not give us absolute and 
final certainty. It only gives us assurance within the limits of our 
mental abilities and the prevailing state of scientific thought. A scien-
tific system is but one station in an endlessly progressing search for 
knowledge. It is necessarily affected by the insufficiency inherent in 
every human effort. But to acknowledge these facts does not mean 
that present-day economics is backward. It merely means that eco- 
nomics is a living thing-and to live implies both imperfection and 
change. 

The reproach of an alleged backwardness is raised against economics 
from two different points of view. 
There are on the one hand some naturalists and physicists who 
censure economics for not being a natural science and not applying the 


Human Action 

methods and procedures of the laboratory. It is one of the tasks of 
this treatise to explode the fallacy of such ideas. In these introductory 
remarks it may be enough to say a few words about their psycho- 
logical background. It is common with narrow-minded people to 
reflect upon every respect in which other people differ from them- 
selves. The camel in the fable takes exception to all other animals for 
not having a hump, and the Ruritanian criticizes the Laputanian for 
not being a Ruritanian. The research worker in the laboratory con- 
siders it as the sole worthy home of inquiry, and differential equations 
as the only sound method of expressing the results of scientific 
thought. He is simply incapable of seeing the epistemological problems 
of human action. For him economics cannot be anything but a form 
of mechanics. 

Then there are people who assert that something must be wrong 
with the social sciences because social conditions are unsatisfactory. 
The natural sciences have achieved amazing results in the last two 
or three hundred years, and the practical utilization of these results 
has succeeded in improving the general standard of living to an un- 
precedented extent. But, say these critics, the socia1 sciences have 
utterly failed in the task of rendering social conditions more satis- 
factory. They have not stamped out misery and starvation, economic 
crises and unemployment, war and tyranny. They are sterile and have 
contributed nothing to the promotion of happiness and human wel- 
fare. 

These grumblers do not realize that the tremendous progress of 
technological methods of production and the resulting increase in 
wealth and welfare were feasible only through the pursuit of those 
liberal policies which were the practical application of the teachings 
of economics. It was the ideas of the classical economists that removed 
the checks imposed by age-old laws, customs, and prejudices upon 
technological improvement and freed the genius of reformers and 
innovators from the straitjackets of the guilds, government tutelage, 
and sociai pressure of various kinds. It was they that reduced the 
prestige of conquerors and expropriators and demonstrated the social 
benefits derived from business activity. None of the great modern 
inventions would have been put to use if the mentality of the pre- 
capitalistic era had not been thoroughly demolished by the economists. 
What is commonly called the "industrial revolution" was an offspring 
of the ideological revolution brought about by the doctrines of the 
economists. The economists exploded the old tenets: that it is unfair 
and unjust to outdo a competitor by producing better and cheaper 


goods; that it is iniquitous to deviate from the traditional methods 
of production; that machines are an evil because they bring about 
unemployment; that it is one of the tasks of civil government to 
prevent efficient businessmen from getting rich and to protect the 
less efficient against the competition of the more efficient; that to 
restrict the freedom of entrepreneurs by government compulsion or 
by coercion on the part of other social powers is an appropriate means 
to promote a nation's well-being. British political economy and French 
Physiocracy were the pacemakers of modern capitalism. It is they 
that made possible the progress of the natural sciences that has heaped 
l~enefitsupon the masses. 

What is wrong with our age is precisely the widespread ignorance 
of the role which these policies of economic freedom played in the 
technical evolution of the last two hundred years. People fell prey 
to the fallacy that the improvement of the methods of production 
was contemporaneous with the policy of laissez faire only by acci- 
dent. Deluded by Marxian myths, they consider modern industrial- 
ism an outcome of the operation of mysterious LLprod~cti~e 

forces" 
that do not depend in any tvalr on ideological factors. Classical eco- 
nomics, they believe, was not-a factor in the rise of capitalism, but 
rather its product, its "ideological superstructure," i.e., a doctrine 
designed to defend the unfair claims of the capitalist exploiters. Hence 
the abolition of capitalism and the substitution of socialist totalitarian- 
ism for a market economy and free enterprise would not impair the 
further progress of technology. It would, on the contrary, promote 
technological improvement by removing the obstacles which the 
selfish interests of the capitalists place in its way. 

The characteristic feature of this age of destructive wars and social 
disintegration is the revolt against economics. Thomas Carlyle branded 
economics a "dismal science," and Karl Marx stigmatized the econ- 
omists as "the sycophants of the bourgeoisie." Quacks-praising their 
patent medicines and short cuts to the earthly paradise-take pleasure 
in scorning economics as "orthodox" and "reactionary." Demagogues 
pride themselves on what they call their victories over economics. 
The "practical" man boasts of his contempt for economics and his 
ignorance of the teachings of "armchair" economists. The economic 
policies of the last decades have been the outcome of a mentality 
that scoffs at any variety of sound economic theory and glorifies the 
spurious doctrines of its detractors. What is called "orthodox" eco-
nomics is in most countries barred from the universities and is 
virtually unknown to the leading statesmen, politicians, and writers. 


Hzmzan Action 

The blame for the unsatisfactory state of economic affairs can cer- 
tainly not be placed upon a science which both rulers and masses 
despise and ignore. 

It must be emphasized that the destiny of modern civilization as 
developed by the white peoples in the last two hundred years is in- 
separably linked with the fate of economic science. This civilization 
was able to spring into existence because the peoples were dominated 
by ideas which were the application of the teachings of economics to 
the problems of economic policy. It will and must perish if the 
nations continue to pursue the course which they entered upon under 
the spell of doctrines rejecting economic thinking. 

It is true that economics is a theoretical science and as such abstains 
from any judgment of valuc. It is not its task to tell pcople what ends 
they should aim at. It is a science of the means to be applied for the 
attainment of ends chosen, not, to be sure, a science of the choosing 
of ends. Ultimate decisions, the valuations and the choosing of ends, 
are beyond the scopc of any science. Science never tells a man how 
he should act; it merely shows how a man must act if he wants to at- 
tain definite ends. 

It seems to many people that this is very little indeed and that a 
scicnce limited to thc investigation of the is and unable to express 
a judgment of value about the highest and ultimate ends is of no im- 
portance for life and action. This too is a mistake. However, the ex- 
posure of this mistake is not a task of thcse introductory remarks. It 
is one of the ends of the treatise itself. 

It was necessary to make these preliminary remarks in order to 
cxplain why this treatise places economic problems within the broad 
frame of a general theory of human action. At the present stage both 
of economic thinking and of political discussions concerning the 
fundamental issues of social organization, it is no longer feasible to 
isolate the treatment of catallactic problems proper. These problems 
are only a segmcnt of a general science of human action and must be 
dealt with as such. 


Part One 

Human Action 


I. ACTING MAN 
r. Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction 
H 
H
UMAN action is purposeful behavior. Or we may say: Action is 
will put into operation and transformed into an agency, is aim- 
ing at ends and goals, is the ego's meaningful response to stimuli and 
to the conditions of its environment, is a person's conscious adjust- 
ment to the state of the universe that determines his life. Such para- 
phrases may clarify the definition given and prevent possible misin- 
terpretations. But the definition itself is adequate and does not need 
complement or commentary. 

Conscious or purposeful behavior is in sharp contrast to uncon- 
scious behavior, i.e., the refiexes and the involuntary responses of 
the body's cells and nerves to stimuli. People are sometimes pre- 
pared to believe that the boundaries between conscious behavior 
and the involuntary reaction of the forces operating within man's 
body are more or less indefinite. This is correct only as far as it is 
sometimes not easy to establish whether concrete behavior is to be 
considered voluntary or involuntary. But the distinction between 
consciousness and unconsciousness is nonetheless sharp and can be 
clearly determined. 

The unconscious behavior of the bodily organs and cells is for 
the acting ego no less a datum than any other fact of the external 
world. Acting man must take into account all that goes on within 
his own body as well as other data, e.g., the weather or the attitudes 
of his neighbors. There is, of course, a margin within which purpose- 
ful behavior has the power to neutraIize the working of bodily 
factors. It is feasible within certain limits to get the body under con- 
trol. Man can sometimes succeed through the power of his will in 
overcoming sickness, in compensating for the innate or acquired in- 
sufficiency of his physical constitution, or in suppressing reflexes. As 
far as this is possible, the field of purposeful action is extended. If a 
man abstains from controlling the involuntary reaction of cells and 
nerve centers, although he would be in a position to do so, his be- 
havior is from our point of view purposeful. 

The field of our science is human action, not the psychological 


Human Action 

events which result in an action. It is precisely this which distinguishes 
the general theory of human action, praxeology, from psychology. 
The theme of psychology is the internal events that result or can 
result in a definite action. TL~theme of praxeoIogy is action as such. 
This also settles the relation of praxeology to the psychoanalytical 
concept of the subconscious. Psychoanalysis too is psychology and 
does not investigate action but the forces and factors that impel a 
man toward a definite action. The psychoanalytical subconscious is 
a psychological and not a praxeological category. Whether an action 
stenk from clear deliberation, or from forgotten memories and sup- 
pressed desires which from submerged regions, as it were, direct the 
wilI, does not influence the nature of the action. The murderer 
whom a subconscious urge (the Id) drives toward his crime and the 
neurotic whose aberrant behavior seems to be simply meaningless to 
an untrained observer both act; they like anybody else are aiming 
at certain ends. It is the merit of psychoanalysis that it has demon- 
strated that even the behavior of neurotics and psychopaths is mean- 
ingful, that they too act and aim at ends, aIthough we who consider 
ourselves normal and sane call the reasoning determining their choice 
of ends nonsensical and the means they choose for the attainment of 
these ends contrary to purpose. 

The term "unconscious" as used by praxeology and the term "sub- 
conscious" as applied by psychoanalysis belong to two different 
systems of thought and research. ~~axeolog~ no less than other 
branches of knowledge owes much to psychoanalysis. The more 
necessary is it then to become aware of the line which separates 
praxeology from psychoanalysis. 

Action is not simply giving preference. Alan also show-s preference 
in situations in which things and events are unavoidable or are be- 
lieved to be so. Thus a man may prefer sunshine to rain and Inav wish 
that the sun would dispel the clouds. He who only wishes and hopes 
does not interfere actively with the course of events and wjth the 
shaping of his own destiny. But acting man chooses, determines, and 
tries to reach an end. Of two things both of which he cannot have 
together he selects one and gives up the other. Action therefore al- 
ways involves both taking and renunciation. 

To express wishes and hopes and to announce planned action 
may be forms of action in so far as they aim in themselves at the 
realization of a certain purpose. But they-must not be confused with 
the actions to which they refer. They are not identical with the 
actions they announce, recommend, or reject. Action is a real thing. 
What counts is a man's total behavior, and not his talk about planned 


Acting Man 

but not realized acts. On the other hand action must be clearly dis- 
tinguished from the application of labor. Action means the em-
ployment of means for the attainment of ends. As a rule one of the 
means employed is the acting man's labor. But this is not always the 
case. Under special conditions a word is all that is needed. He who 
gives orders or interdictions may act without any expenditure of 
labor. To talk or not to talk, to smile or to remain serious, may be 
action. To consume and to enjoy are no less action than to abstain 
from accessible consumption and enjoyment. 

Praxeology consequently does not distinguish between "active" 
or energetic and "passive" or indolent man. The vigorous man in- 
dustriously striving for the improvement of his condition acts neither 
more nor less than the lethargic man who sluggishly takes things as 
they come. For to do nothing and to bc idle are also action, they too 
determine the course of events. Wherever the conditions for human 
interference are present, man acts no matter whether he interferes 
or refrains from interfering. He who endures what he could change 
acts no less than he who interferes in order to attain another result. 
A man who abstains from influencing the operation of physiological 
and instinctive factors which he could influence also acts. Action is 
not only doing but no less omitting to do what possibly could be done. 

We may say that action is the manifestation of a man's will. But 
this would not add anything to our knowledge. For the term will 
means nothing else than man's faculty to choose between different 
states of affairs, to prefer one, to set aside the other, and to behave ac- 
cording to the decision made in aiming at the chosen state and for- 
saking the other. 

2. The Prerequisites of Human Action 
We call contentment or satisfaction that state of a human being 
which does not and cannot result in any action. Acting man is eager 
to substitute a more satisfactory state of affairs for a less satisfactory. 
His mind imagines conditions which suit him better, and his action 
aims at bringing about this desired state. The incentive that impels 
a man to act is always some uneasiness? A man perfectly content 
with the state of his affairs would have no incentive to change things. 
He would have neither wishes nor desires; he would be perfectly 
happy. He would not act; he would simply live free from care. 

I. Cf. Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, ed. Fraser (Ox-
ford, 18gq), 1, 331-333; Leibniz, Nouveaux enais s74r l'entendement humain, ed. 
Flammarion, p. 1I 9. 

Human Action 

But to make a man act, uneasiness and the image of a more satis- 
factory state alone are not sufficient. A third condition is required: the 
expectation that purposeful behavior has the power to remove or at 
least to alleviate the felt uneasiness. In the absence of this condition 
no action is feasible. Man must yield to the inevitable. He must sub- 
mit to destiny. 

These are the general conditions of human action. Man is the being 
that lives under these conditions. He is not only homo sapiens, but 
no less homo agens. Beings of human descent who either from birth 
or from acquired defects are unchangeably unfit for any action (in 
the strict sense of the term and not only in the legal sense) are prac- 
tically not human. Although the statutes and biology consider 
them to be men, they lack the essential featurc of humanity. The 
newborn child too is not an acting being. It has not yet gone the 
whole way from conception to the full development of its human 
qualities. But at the end of this evolution it becomes an acting 
being. 

On Happiness 

In colloquial speech we call a man "happy" who has succeeded in at- 
taining his ends. A more adequate description of his state would be that he 
is happier than he was before. There is however no valid objection to a 
usage that defines human action as the striving for happiness. 

But we must avoid current misunderstandings. The ultimate goal of 
human action is always the satisfaction of the acting man's desire. There is 
no standard of greater or lesser satisfaction other than individual judgments 
of value, different for various people and for the same people at various 
times. What makes a man feel uneasy and less uneasy is established by him 
from the standard of his own will and judgment, from his personal and 
subjective valuation. Nobody is in a position to decree what should make 
a fellow man happier. 

To establish this fact does not refer in any way to the antitheses of egoism 
and altruism, of materialism and idealism, of individualism and collectiv- 
ism, of atheism and religion. There are people whose only aim is to improve 
the condition of their own ego. There are other people with whom aware- 
ness of the troubles of their fellow men causes as much uneasiness as or 
even more uneasiness than their own wants. There are people who desire 
nothing else than the satisfaction of their appetites for sexual intercourse, 
food, drinks, fine homes, and other material things. But other men care 
more for the satisfactions commonly called "higher" and "ideal." There 
are individuals eager to adjust their actions to the requirements of social 
cooperation; there are, on the other hand, refractory people who defy the 
rules of social life. There are people for whom the ultimate goal of the 
earthly pilgrimage is the preparation for a life of bliss. There are other 


Acting Man 

people who do not believe in the teachings of any religion and do not allow 
their actions to be influenced by them. 

Praxeology is indifferent to the ultimate goals of action. Its findings are 
valid for all kinds of action irrespective of the ends aimed at. It is a science 
of means, not of ends. It applies the term happiness in a purely formal 
sense. In the praxeological terminology the proposition: man's unique aim 
is to attain happiness, is tautological. It does not imply any statement about 
the state of affairs from which man expects happiness. 

The idea that the incentive of human activity is always some uneasiness 
and its aim always to remove such uneasiness as far as possible, that is, to 
make the acting men feel happier, is the essence of the teachings of Eudae- 
monism and Hedonism. Epicurean Brapa& is that state of perfect happi- 
ness and contentment at which all human activity aims without ever 
wholly attaining it. In the face of the grandeur of this cognition it is of 
little avail only that many representatives of this philosophy failed to rec- 
ognize the purely formal character of the notions pain and pleasure and 
gave them a material and carnal meaning. The theological, mystical, and 
other schools of a heteronomous ethic did not shake the core of Epicurean- 
ism because they could not raise any other objection than its neglect of the 
"higher" and "nobler" pleasures. It is true that the writings of many earlier 
champions of Eudaemonism, Hedonism, and Utilitarianism are in some 
points open to misinterpretation. But the language of modern philosophers 
and still more that of the modern economists is so precise and straightfor- 
ward that no misinterpretation can possibly occur. 

On Instincts and Inzpulses 

One does not further the comprehension of the fundamental problem 
of human action by the methods of instinct-sociology. This school classi- 
fies the various concrete goals of human action and assigns to each class a 
special instinct as its motive. Man appears as a being driven by various in- 
nate instincts and dispositions. It is assumed that this explanation demol- 
ishes once for all the odious teachings of economics and utilitarian ethics. 
However, Feuerbach has already justly observed that every instinct is an 
instinct to happines~.~ 

The method of instinct-psychology and instinct- 
sociology consists in an arbitrary classification of the immediate goals of 
action and in a hypostasis of each. Whereas praxeology says that the goal 
of an action is to remove a certain uneasiness, instinct-psychology says it 
is the satisfaction of an instinctive urge. 

Many champions of the instinct school are convinced that they have 
proved that action is not determined by reason, but stems from the pro- 
found depths of innate forces, impulses, instincts, and dispositions which 
are not open to any rational elucidation. They are certain they have suc- 
ceeded in exposing the shallowness of rationaIisrn and disparage economics 

2. Cf. Feuerbach, Simmtliche Werke, ed. Bolin and Jodl (Stuttgart, 19071,X, 
231. 

Human Action 

as "a tissue of false conc1usions drawn from false psychological assump- 
tions." Yet rationalism, praxeology, and economics do not deal with the 
ultimate springs and goals of action, but with the means applied for the 
attainment of an end sought. However unfathomable the depths may be 
from which an impulse or instinct emerges, the means which man chooses 
for its satisfaction are determined by a rational consideration of expense 
and success. 

He who acts under an emotional impulse also acts. What distinguishes 
an emotional action from other actions is the valuation of input and output. 
Emotions disarrange valuations. Inflamed with passion man sees the goal 
as more desirable and the price he has to pay for it as less burdensome than 
he would in cool deliberation. Men have never doubted that even in the 
state of emotion means and ends are pondered and that it is possible to in- 
fluence the outcome of this deliberation by rendering more costly the 
yielding to the passionatc impulse. To punish criminal offenses committed 
in a state of emotional excitement or intoxication more mildly than other 
offenses is tantamount to encouraging such excesses. The threat of severe 
retaliation does not fail to deter even people driven by seemingly irresisti- 
ble passion. 

We interpret animal behavior on the assumption that the animal yields 
to the impulse which prevails at the moment. As we observe that the 
animal feeds, cohabits, and attacks other animals or men, we speak of its 
instincts of nourishment, of reproduction, and of aggression. We assume 
that such instincts are innate and peremptorily ask for satisfaction. 

But it is different with man. Man is not a being who cannot help yielding 
to the impulse that most urgently asks for satisfaction. Man is a being ca- 
pable of subduing his instincts, emotions, and impulses; he can rationalize 
his behavior. He renounces the satisfaction of a burning impulsc in order 
to satisfy other desires. He is not a puppet of his appetites. A man does not 
ravish every female that stirs his senses; he does not devour every piece of 
food that entices him; he does not knock down every fellow he would like 
to kill. He arranges his wishes and desires into a scale, he chooses; in short, 
he acts. What distinguishes man from beasts is precisely that he adjusts his 
behavior deliberatively. Man is the being that has inhibitions, that can 
master his impulses and desires, that has the power to suppress instinctive 
desires and impulses. 

It may happen that an impulse emerges with such vehemence that no 
disadvantage which its satisfaction may cause appears great enough to pre- 
vent the individual from satisfying it. In this case too there is choosing. 
Man decides in favor of yielding to the desire c~ncerned.~

Boston, 1921),p. 11. 
4. In such cases a great role is played by the circumstance that the two satis- 
factions concerned-that expected from yielding to the impulse and that ex- 
pected from the avoidance of its undesirable consequences-are not contempo- 
raneous. Cf. below, pp. 476487. 

Acting Man 

3. Human Action as an Cltimate Given 
Since time immemorial men have been eager to know the prime 
mover, the cause of all being and of all change, thc ultimatc substance 
from which everything stems and which is the cause of itself. Science 
is more modest. It is awarc of the limits of the human mind and of 
the human search for know-ledge. It aims at tracing back every 
phenomenon to its cause. But it rcalizes that these endeavors must 
necessarily strike against insurmountable walls. There are phenomena 
which cannot be analyzed and traced back to other phenomcna. They 
arc the ultimate given. The progress of scientific research may suc- 
ceed in demonstrating that something previously considered as an 
ultimate given can be reduced to components. But there will always 
be somc irreducible and unanalyzable phenomena, some ultimate 
given. 

Monism teaches that there is but one ultimate substance, dualism 
that there are two, pluralism that there are many. There is no point 
in quarreling about these problems. Such metaphysical disputes are 
internlinablc. The present state of our knowledge does not provide 
the means to solve them with an answer which cvery reasonable man 
must consider satisfactory. 

Materialist monism contends that human thoughts and volitions are 
the product of the operation of bodily organs, the cells of the brain 
and the nerves. Human thought, will, and action are soIely brought 
about by material processes which onc day will be completely ex- 
plained by the methods of physical and chemical inquiry. This too is 
a metaphysical hypothesis, although its supporters consider it as an 
unshakable and undeniable scientific truth. 

Various doctrines have been advanced to explain the relation be-
tween mind and bodv. They are mere surmiscs without any reference 
to observed facts. All that can be said with certainty is that there are 
relations between mental and physiological processes. With regard 
to the nature and operation of this connection we know Iittle if any-
thing. 

Concrete value judgments and definite human actions are not 
open to further analysis. We may fairly assume or believe that they 
are absolutcly dependent upon and conditioned by their causes. But 
as long as we do not know how external facts-physical and phvsio- 
logical-produce in a human mind definite thoughts and volitions 
resdting in concrcte acts, we have to face an insurmountable method-
ological dualism. In thc present state of our knowledge the funda- 
mental statements of positivism, monism and panphysicaIism are 


Human Action 

mere metaphysical postulates devoid of any scientific foundation 
and both meaningless and useIess for scientific research. Reason and 
experience show us two separate realms: the external world of physi- 
cal, chemical, and physiological phenomena and the internal world 
of thought, feeling, valuation, and purposeful action. No bridge con- 
nects-as far as we can see today-these two spheres. Identical ex- 
ternal events result sometimes in different human responses, and 
different external events produce sometimes the same human response. 
We do not know why. 

In the face of this state of affairs wc cannot help withholding judg- 
ment on the essential statements of monism and materialism. We may 
or may not believe that the natural sciences will succeed one day in 
explaining the production of definite ideas, judgments of value, and 
actions in the same way in which they explain the production of a 
chemical compound as the necessary and unavoidable outcome of 
a certain combination of elements. In the meantime we are bound to 
acquiesce in a methodological dualism. 

Human action is one of the agencies bringing about change. It 
is an element of cosmic activity and becoming. Therefore it is a legiti- 
mate object of scientific investigation. As-at least under present con- 
ditions-it cannot be traced back to its causes, it must be considered 
as an ultimate given and must be studied as such. 

It is true that the changes brought about by human action are 
but trifling when compared with the effects of the operation of the 
great cosmic forces. From the point of view of ctcrnity and the in- 
finite universe man is an infinitesimal speck. But for man human action 
and its vicissitudes are the real thing. Action is the essence of his 
nature and existence, his means of preserving his life and raising him- 
self above the level of animals and plants. However perishable and 
evanescent all human efforts may be, for man and for human science 
they are of primary importance. 

4. Rationality and Trrationaiity; Subjectivism 
and Objectivity of Praxeological Research 
Human action is necessarily always rational. The term "rational 
action" is therefore pleonastic and must be rejected as such. When 
applied to the ultimate ends of action, the terms rational and ir- 
rational are inappropriate and meaningless. The ultimate end of 
action is always the satisfaction of some desires of the acting man. 
Since nobody is it1 a position to substitute his own value judgments 
for those of the acting individual, it is vain to pass judgment on other 


Acting Man 

people's aims and volitions. No man is qualified to declare what would 
make another man happier or less discontented. The critic either tells 
us what he believes he would aim at if he were in the place of his fel- 
low; or, in dictatoria1 arrogance blithely disposing of his fellow's wilI 
and aspirations, declarcs what condition of this other man would better 
suit himself, the critic. 

It is usual to call an action irrational if it aims, at the expense of 
"material" and tangible advantages, at the attainment of "ideal" or 
"higher" satisfactions. In this sense people say, for instance-some- 
tinles with approvaI, sometimes with disapproval-that a man who 
sacrifices life, health, or wealth to the attainment of "higher" goods- 
like fidelity to his religious, philosophical, and political convictions 
or the freedom and flowering of his nation-is motivated by irrational 
considerations. Howcvcr, the striving after these higher ends is neither 
more nor less rational or irrational than that after other human ends. 
It is a mistake to assume that the desire to procurc the bare necessities 
of life and health is more rational, natural, or justified than the striving 
after other goods or amenities. It is true that the appetite for food and 
warmth is common to mcn and other mammals and that as a rule a 
man who lacks food and shelter concentrates his efforts upon the 
satisfaction of these urgcnt needs and does not care much for other 
things. The impulse to live, to preserve one's own Iife, and to take 
advantage of every opportunity of strengthening one's vital forces 
is a primal feature of life, present in every living being. However, to 
yield to this impulse is not-for man-an inevitable necessity. 

While all other animals are unconditionally driven by the impulse 
to preserve their own lives and by the impulse of prolification, man 
has the power to master even these impulses. He can control both 
his sexual desires and his will to live. He can give up his Iife when 
the conditions under which alone he could presave it scan in-
tolerable. Man is capable of dying for a cause or of committing 
suicide. To live is for man the outcome of a choice, of a judgment 
of value. 

It is the same with the desire to live in affluence. The very existence 
of ascetics and of men who renounce material gains for the sake of 
clinging to their convictions and of preserving their dignity and self- 
respect is cvidence that the striving after more tangible amenities is 
not inevitable but rather the result of a choice. Of course, the im- 
mense majority prefer life to death and wealth to poverty. 

It is arbitrary to consider only the satisfaction of the body's physio- 
logical needs as "natural" and therefore "rational" and everything 
else as "artificial" and therefore "irrational." It is the characteristic: 


2o Human Action 

feature of human nature that man seeks not only food, shelter, and 
cohabitation like all other animals, but that he aims also at other kinds 
of satisfaction. Man has specifically human desires and needs which 
we may call "higher" than those which he has in common with the 
other mammals." 

When applied to the means chosen for the attainment of ends, the 
terms rational and irrational imply a judgment about the expediency 
and adequacy of the procedure employed. The critic approves or dis- 
approves of the method from the point of view of whether or not 
it is best suited to attain the end in question. It is a fact that human 
reason is not infallible and that man very often errs in selecting and 
applying means. An action unsuited to the end sought falls short of 
expectation. It is contrary to purpose, but it is rational, i.e., the 
outcome of a reasonable-although faulty-deliberation and an at- 
tempt-although an ineffectual atternpt-to attain a definite goal. 
'The doctors who a hundred years ago employed certain methods 
for the treatment of cancer which our contemporary doctors reject 
were-from the point of view of present-day pathology-badly in-
structed and therefore inefficient. But they did not act irrationalIy; 
they did their best. It is probable that in a hundred years more doctors 
will have more efficient methods at hand for the treatment of this 
disease. They will be more efficient but not more rational than our 
physicians. 

The opposite of action is not irrational behavior, but a reactive re- 
sponse to stimuli on the part of the bodily organs and instincts which 
cannot be controlled by the volition of the person concerned. To the 
same stimulus man can under certain conditions respond both by 
reactive response and by action. If a man absorbs a poison, the organs 
react by setting up their forces of antidotal defense; in addition, action 
may interfere by applying counterpoison. 

With regard to the problem involved in the antithesis, rational 
and irrational, there is no difference between the natural sciences 
and rhe social sciences. Science always is arid must be rathiid. It is 
the endeavor to attain a mental grasp of the phenomena of the uni- 
verse by a systematic arrangement of thc whole body of available 
knowledge. However, as has been pointed out above, the analysis of 
objects into their constituent elements must sooner or later neces- 
sarily reach a point beyond which it cannot go. The human mind is 
not kven capable of conceiving a kind of knowledge not limited by

misunderstandingof the Malthusian theory see below, pp. 663-669. 

Acting Man 

an ultimate given inaccessible to further analysis and reduction. 
The scientific method that carries the mind up to this point is entirely 
rational. The ultimate given may be calIed an irrational fact. 

It is fashionable nowadays to find fault with the social sciences for 
being purely rational. The most popular objection raised against eco- 
nomics is that it neglects the irrationality of life and reality and tries 
to press into dry rational schemes and bloodless abstractions the in- 
finite variety of phenomena. No censure could be more absurd. Like 
every branch of knowledge economics goes as far as it can be carried 
by rational methods. Then it stops by establishing the fact that it is 
faced with an ultimate given, ix., a phenomenon which cannot-at 
least in the present state of our knowledge-be further analy~ed.~ 

The teachings of praxeology and economics are valid for every 
human action without regard to its underlying motives, causes, and 
goals. The ultimate judgments of vaIue and the ultimate ends of human 
action are given for any kind of scientific inquiry; they are not open 
to any further analysis. Praxeology deals with the ways and means 
chosen for the attaiknent of such ultimate ends. Its object is means, 
not ends. 

In this sense we speak of the subjectivism of the general science of 
human action. It takes the ultimate ends chosen by acting man as data, 
it is entirely neutral with regard to them, and it refrains from passing 
any value judgments. The only standard which it applies is whether 
or not the means chosen are fit for the attainment of the ends aimed 
at. If Eudaemonism says happiness, if Utilitarianism and economics 
say utility, we must interpret these terms in a subjectivistic way as 
that which acting man aims at because it is desirable in his eyes. It is 
in this formalism that the progress of the modern meaning of 
Eudaemonism, Hedonism, and Utilitarianism consists as opposed to 
the older material meaning and the progress of the modern subjecti- 
vistic theory of value as opposed to the objectivistic theory of value as 
expounded by classical political economy. At the same time it is in 
this subjectivism that the objectivity of-our science lies. Because it 
is subjectivistic and takes the value judgments of acting man as ulti- 
mate data not open to any further critical examination, it is itself 
above all strife of parties and factions, it is indifferent to the con- 
flicts of all schools of dogmatism and ethical doctrines, it is free from 
valuations and preconceived ideas and judgments, it is universally 
valid and absolutely and plainly human. 

6. We shall see later (pp. 49-58) how the empirical social scienccs deal with 
the ultimate given. 

2.2 Human Action 
5. Causality as a Requirement of Action 
Man is in a position to act because he has the abiIity to discover 
causal relations which determine change and becoming in the uni- 
verse. Acting requires and presupposes the category of causality. 
Only a man who sees the world in the light of causality is fitted to 
act. In this sense we may say that causality is a category of action. 
The category means and ends presupposes the category cause and 
effect. In a world without causality and regularity of phenomena 
there would be no field for human reasoning and human action. S,uch 
a world would be a chaos in which man would be at a loss to find any 
orientation and guidance. Adan is not even capable of imagining the 
conditions of such a chaotic universe. 

Where man does not see any causal relation, he cannot act. This 
statement is not reversible. Even when he knows the causal relation in- 
volved, man cannot act if he is not in a position to influence the cause. 

The archetype of causality research was: where and how must I 
interfere in order to divert the course of events from the way it 
would go in the absence of my interference in a direction which 
better suits my wishes? In this sense man raises the question: who or 
what is at the bottom of things? He searches for the regularity and 
the "law," because he wants to interfere. OnIy later was this search 
more extensively interpreted by metaphysics as a search after the ulti- 
mate cause of being and existence. Centuries were needed to bring 
these exaggerated and extravagant ideas back again to the more 
modest question of where one must interfere or should one be able to 
interfere in order to attain this or that end. 

The treatment accorded to the problem of causality in the last 
decades has been, due to a confusion brought about by some eminent 
physicists, rather unsatisfactory. We may hope that this unpleasant 
chapter in the history of philosophy will be a warning to future 
philosophers. 

-1I nere are changes whose causes are, at least for the present timc, 
unknown to us. Sometimes we succeed in acquiring a partial knowl- 
edge so that we are able to say: in 70 per cent of all cases A results 
in B, in the remaining cases in C, or even in D, E, F, and so on. In 
order to substitute for this fragmentary information more precise 
information it would be necessary to break up A into its elements. 
As long as this is not achieved, we must acquiesce in a statistical law. 
But this does not affect the praxeological meaning of causality. Total 
or practical ignorance in some areas does not demolish the category 
of causality. 


Acting Man 

The philosophical, epistemological, and metaphysical problems of 
causality and of imperfect induction are beyond the scope of praxe- 
ology. We must simply establish the fact that in order to act, man 
must knoiv the causal relationship between events, processes, or states 
of affairs. And only as far as he knows this relationship, can his action 
attain the ends sought. We are fully aware that in asserting this we 
are moving in a circle. For the evidence that we have correctly per- 
ceived a causal relation is provided only by the fact that action guided 
by this knowledge results in the expected outcome. But we cannot 
avoid this vicious circular evidence precisely because causality is a 
category of action. And because it is such a category, praxeology can- 
not help bestowing some attention on this fundamental problem of 
philosophy. 

6. The Alter Ego 
If we are prepared to take the term causality in its broadest sense, 
teleology can be called a variety of causal inquiry. Final causes are 
first of all causes. The cause of an event is seen as an action or quasi- 
action aiming at some end. 

Both primitive man and the infant, in a na'ive anthropomorphic 
attitude, consider it quite plausible that every change and event is 
the outcome of the action of a being acting in the same way as they 
themselves do. They believe that animals, plants, mountains, rivers, 
and fountains, even stones and celestial bodies, are, like themselves, 
feeling, wilIing, and acting beings. Only at a later stage of cultural 
development does man renounce these animistic ideas and substitute 
the mechanistic world view for them. Mechanicalism proves to be so 
satisfactory a principle of conduct that people finally believe it 
capable of solving all the problems of thought and scientific research. 
Materialism and panphysicalism proclaim mechanicalism as the es-
sence of all knowledge and the experimental and mathematical 
methods of the natural sciences as the sole scientific mode of think- 
ing. All changes are to be comprehended as motions subject to the 
laws of mechanics. 

The champions of mechanicalism do not bother about the still un- 
solved problems of the logical and epistemological basis of the 
principles of causality and imperfect induction. In their eyes these 
principles are sound because they work. The fact that experiments in 
the laboratory bring about the results predicted by the theories and 
that machines in the factories run in the way predicted by technology 
proves, they say, the soundness of the methods and findings of modern 


Human Action 

natural science. Granted that science cannot give us truth-and who 
knows what truth really means?-at any rate it is certain that it 
works in leading us to success. 

But it is precisely when we accept this pragmatic point of view 
that the emptiness of the panphysicalist dogma becomes manifest. 
Science, as has been poinfed out above, has not succeeded in solving 
the problems of the mind-body relations. The panphysicalists cer- 
tainly cannot contend that the procedures they recommend have ever 
worked in the field of interhuman relations and of the social sciences. 
But it is beyond doubt that the principle according to which an Ego 
deals with every human being as if the other were a thinking and act- 
ing being like himself has evidenced its usefulness both in mundane life 
and in scientific research. It cannot be denied that it works. 

lt is beyond doubt that the practice of considering fellow men as 
beings who think and act as I, the Ego, do has turned out well; on 
the other hand the prospect seems hopeless of getting a similar prag- 
matic verification for the postulate requiring them to be treated in 
the same manner as the objects of the natural sciences. The epistemo- 
logical problems raised by the comprehension of other people's be- 
havior are no less intricate than those of causality and incomplete 
induction. It may be admitted that it is impossible to provide con- 
clusive evidence for the propositions that my logic is the logic of all 
other people and by all means absolutely the only human logic and 
that the categories of my action are the categories of all other people's 
action and by all means absoIutely the categories of all human action. 
However, the pragmatist must remember that these propositions 
work both in practice and in science, and the positivist must not 
overlook the fact that in addressing his fellow men he presupposes 
-tacitly and implicitly-the intersubjective validity of logic and 
thereby the reality of the realm of the alter Ego's thought and action, 
of his eminent human chara~ter.~ 

Thinking and acting are the specific human features of man. They 
are pecdiar te a!! hnzanbeifigs. Thev are, bcpxd rne~bershi~in :he

t 

zoological species homo sapiens, the characteristic mark of man as 
man. It is not the scope of praxeology to investigate the relation of 
thinking and acting. For praxeology it is enough to establish the fact 
that there is only one logic that is intelligible to the human mind, and 
that there is only one mode of action which is human and compre- 
hensible to the human mind. Whether there are or can be somewhere 
other beings-superhuman or subhuman-who think and act in a

p. 18. 

Acting Man 

different way, is beyond the reach of the human mind. We must re- 
strict our endeavors to the study of human action. 

This human action which is inextricably linked with human 
thought is conditioned by logical necessity. It is impossible for the 
human mind to conceive logical relations at variance with the logical 
structure of our mind. It is impossible for the human mind to conceive 
a mode of action whose categories would differ from the categories 
urhich determine our own actions. 

There are for man only two principles available for a mental grasp 
of reality, namely, those of teleology and causality. What cannot be 
brough; under either of these categories is absolutcIy hidden to the 
human mind. An event not open to an interpretation by one of these 
two principles is for man inconceivable and mysterious. Change can 
be conceived as the outcome either of the operation of mechanistic 
causality or of purposeful behavior; for the human mind there is no 
third way a~ailable.~ 

It is true, as has already been mentioned, that 
teleology can be viewed as a variety of causality. But the establish- 
ment of this fact docs not annul the essential differences between the 
two categories. 

The panmechanistic world view is committed to a methodological 
monism; it acknowledges only mechanistic causality because it at- 
tributes to it alone any cogniiive value or at least a higher cognitive 
value than to teleology. This is a metaphysical superstition. Both 
principles of cognition--causality and teleology-are, owing to the 
limitations of human reason, imperfect and do not convey ultimate 
knnwledge. Causality leads to a regressus in infiniturn which reason 
can never exhaust. Teleology is found wanting as soon as the ques- 
tion is raised of what moves the prime mover. Either method stops 
short at an ultimate given which cannot be analyzed and interpreted. 
Reasoning and scientific inquiry can never bring full ease of mind, 
apodictic certainty, and perfect'cognition of all things. He who seeks 
this must apply to faith and try to quiet his conscience by embracing 
a creed or a metaphysical doctrine. 

If we do not transcend the realm of reason and experience, we can- 
not help acknowledging that our fellow men act. We are not free 
to disregard this fact for the sake of a fashionable prcpossession and 
an arbitrary opinion. Daily experience proves not only that the sole 
suitable method for studying the conditions of our nonhuman en-
vironment is provided by the category of causaIitv; it proves no less 
convincingly that our fellow men are acting beings as we ourselves

Human Action 

are. For the comprehension of action there is but one scheme of in- 
terpretation and analysis available, namely, that provided by the 
copnition and analysis of our own purposeful behavior. 

The problem of the study and analysis of other pcople's action is 
in no way connected with the problem of the existence of a soul or 
of an imkortal soul. As far as the objections of empiricism, behavior- 
ism, and positivism are directed against any varietv of the soul-theory, 
thev are of no avail for our problem. The question we have to deal 
with is whether it is possible to grasp human action intellectually if 
one refuses to comprehend it as meaningful and purposeful behavior 
aiming at the attainment of definite ends. Rehaviorism and positivism 
want to apply the methods of the empirical natural sciences to the 
realitv of human action. They interpret it as a response to stimuli. 
Rut these stimuli themselves are not open to descrintion by the meth- 
ods of the natural sciences. Every attempt to describe the4 must refer 
to the meaning which acting men attach to them. We may caIl the 
offering of a commoditv fo; sale a "stimuius." But what is essential 
in such an offer and distinguishes it from other offers cannot be 
dcscribed without entering into the mcaning which the acting parties 
attribute to the situation. No dialectical artifice can spirit away the 
fact that man is driven by the aim to attain certain ends. It is this 
purposeful behavior-viz., action-that is the subject matter of our 
scicncc. We cannot approach our subject if we disregard the mean- 
ing which acting man attaches to the situation, i.c., the given state of 
affairs, and to his own behavior with regard to this situation. 

It is not appropriate for the phvsicist to search for final causes be- 
cause there is no indication that the events which are the subject mat- 
ter of physics are to be interpreted as the outcome of actions of a 
being, aiming at ends in a human way. Nor is it appropriate for the 
praxeologist to disregard the operation of the acting being's volition 
and intention because they are undoubtedly given facts. If he were 
to disregard it, he would cease to study human action. Very often- 
but not aiways-the events concerned-can be investigated both from 
the point of view of praxeology and from that of the natural sciences. 
But hc who deals with the discharging of a firearm from thc physical 
and chemical point of view is not a praxeologist. He neglects the very 
problems which the science of purposeful human behavior aims to 
clarify. 

On the Serviceableness of Instincts 

The proof of the fact that only two avenues of approach are available 
for human research, causality or teleology, is provided by the problems 


Acting ~Man 

raiscd in rcference to the serviceableness of instincts. There are types of 
behavior which on the one hand cannot be thoroughly interpreted with 
the causal methods of the natural sciences, but on the other hand cannot 
be considered as purposeful human action. In order to grasp such behavior 
we are forced to resort to a makeshift. We assign to it the character of a 
quasi-action; we speak of serviceable instincts. 

We obscrve two things: first the inherent tendency of a living organism 
to respond to a stimulus according to a regular pattern, and second the 
favorable effects of this kind of behavior for the strengthening or preserva- 
tion of the organism's vital forces. If we were in a position to interpret 
such behavior as the outcome of purposeful aiming at certain ends, we 
would call it action and deal with it according to the tcleological methods 
of praxcology. But as we found no trace of a conscious mind behind this 
behavior, we suppose that an unknown factor-we call it instinct-was 
instrumental. We say that the instinct dirccts quasi-purposeful animal be-
havior and unconscious but nonetheless serviceable responses of human 
muscles and nerves. Yet, the mere fact that we hypostatize the unexplained 
element of this behavior as a force and call it instinct does not enlarge our 
knowledge. We must never forget that this word instinct is nothing but a 
landmark to indicate a point beyond which we are unable, up to the present 
at least, to carry our scientific scrutiny. 

Biology has succeeded in discovering a "natural," i.e., mechanistic, ex- 
planation for many processes which in carlicr days werc attributed to the 
operation of instincts. Nonetheless many others have renlained which can- 
not be interpreted as mechanical or chemical responses to mechanical or 
chemical stimuli. Animals display attitudes which cannot be comprehended 
otherwise than through the assumption that a directing factor was opera- 
tive. 

The aim of behaviorism to study human action from without with the 
methods of animal psychology is illusory. As far as animal behavior goes 
beyond mere physiological processes like breathing and metabolism, it can 
only be investigated with the aid of the meaning-concepts cleveIoped by 
praxeology. The behaviorist approaches the object of his investigations 
with the human notions of purpose and success. He unwittingly applies to 
the subject matter of his studies the human concepts of serviceableness and 
perniciousness. He dcceivcs himself in excluding all verbal reference to 
consciousness and aiming at ends. In fact his mind searches everywhere 
for ends and measures every attitude with thc yardstick of a garblcd notion 
of serviceableness. The science of human behavior-as far as it is not 
physiology-cannot abandon rcfercnce to mcaning and purpose. It can- 
not learn anything from animal psychology and the observation of the un- 
conscious reactions of newborn infants. It is, on the contrary, animal psy- 
chology and infant psychology which cannot renounce the aid afforded by 
the science of human action. Without praxeological categorics we would 
be at a loss to conceive and to understand the behavior both of animals 
and of infants. 


2 8 Human Action 

The observation of the instinctive behavior of animals fills man with 
astonishment and raises questions which nobody can answer satisfactorily. 
Yet the fact that animals and even plants react in a quasi-purposeful way 
is neither more nor less miraculous than that man thinks and acts, that in 
the inorganic univcrse those functional correspondcnces prevail which 
physics describes, and that in the organic universe biologica1 processes 
occur. All this is miraculous in the sense that it is an ultimate given for our 
searching mind. 

Such an ultimate given is what we call animal instinct. Like the concepts 
of motion, force, life, and consciousness, the concept of instinct too is 
merely a term to signify an ultimate given. To be sure, it neither "explains" 
anything nor indicates a cause or an ultimate ca~se.~ 

The Absolute End 

In order to avoid any possible misinterpretation of the praxeoIogica1 
categories it seems expedient to emphasize a truism. 

Praxeology, like the historical sciences of human action, deals with pur- 
poseful human action. If it mentions ends, what it has in view is the ends 
at which acting men aim. If it speaks of meaning, it refers to the meaning 
which acting men attach to their actions. 

Praxeology and history are manifcstations of the human mind and as 
such are conditioned by the intellectual abilities of mortal men. Praxeology 
and history do not pretend to know anything about the intentions of an 
absolute and objective mind, about an objective meaning inherent in the 
course of events and of historical evolution, and about the plans which God 
or Nature or Weltgeist or Manifest Destiny is trying to realize in directing 
the universe and human affairs. They have nothing in common with what 
is called philosophy of history. They do not, like the works of Hegel, 
Comte, Marx, and a host of other writers, claim to reveal information 
about the true, objective, and absolute mcaning of life and history. 

Vegetative Man 

Some philosophies advise man to seek as the ultimate end of conduct the 
complete renunciation of any action. They look upon life as an absolute 
evil full of pain, suffering, and anguish, and apodictically deny that any 
purposeful human effort can render it tolerable. Happiness can be attained 
only by complete extinction of consciousness, volition, and life. The only 
way toward bliss and salvation is to become perfectly passive, indifferent, 
and inert like the plants. The sovereign good is the abandonment of think- 
ing and acting. 

Such is the cssence of the teachings of various Indian philosophies, 
especially of Buddhism, and of Schopenhauer. Praxeology does not com-

ment upon them. It is neutral with regard to all judgments of value and the 
choice of ultimate ends. Its task is not to approve or to disapprove, but 
only to establish facts. 

The subject matter of praxeology is human action. It is not concerned 
with human beings who have succeeded in suppressing altogether every- 
thing that characterizes man as man: will, desire, thought, and the striving 
after ends. It deals with acting man, not with man transformed into a plant 
and reduced to a merely vegetative existence. 


11. THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF 
THE SCIENCES OF HUMAN ACTION 

I. Praxeology and History 
T 
T
HERE are two main branches of the sciences of human action: 
praxeology and history. 

History is the collection and systematic arrangement of all data of 
experience concerning human action. It deals with the concrete con- 
tent of human action. It studies all human endeavors in thcir infinite 
multiplicity and variety and all individual actions with all their ac- 
cidental, special, and particular implications. It scrutinizes the ideas 
guiding acting men and the outcome of the actions performed. It 
embraces every aspect of human activities. It is on the one hand 
general history and on the other hand the history of various nar- 
rower fields. There is the history of political and military action, of 
ideas and philosophy, of economic activities, of technology, of Iiter- 
aturc, art, and science, of religion, of mores and customs, and of many 
other realms of human life. Thcre is ethnology and anthropology, 
as far as they are not a part of biology, and there is psychology as 
far as it is neither physiology nor epistemology nor philosophy. 
There is linguistics as far as it is neither logic nor the physiology of 
speech.l 

Thc subject matter of all historical sciences is the past. They can- 
not teach us anything which would be valid for a11 human actions, 
that is, for the future too. The study of history makes a inan wise 

I. Economic history, descriptive economics, and economic statistics are, oi 
course, history. The term sociology is used in two different meanings. Descrip- 
tive sociology deals with those historical phenomena of human action which are 
not viewed in descriptive economics; it overlaps to some extent the field claimed 
by ethnology and anthropology. General sociology, on the other hand, ap- 
proaches historical experience from a more nearly universal point of view than 
that of the other branches of history. History proper, for instance, deals with 
an individual town or with towns in a definite period or with an individual 
people or with a certain geographical area. Max Weber in his main treatise 
(Wirtscbaft und Qeseilschaft [Tiibingen, 19221, pp. 513-600) deals with the 
town in general, i.e., with the whole historical experience concerning towns 
without any limitation to historical periods, geographical areas, or individual 
peoples, nations, races, and civilizations.

and judicious. But it does not by itself provide any knowledge and 
skill which could be utilized for handling concrete tasks. 

The natural sciences too deal with past events. Every experience 
is an experience of something passed away; there is no experience of 
future happenings. But the experience to which the natural sciences 
owe all their success is the experience of the experiment in which 
the individual elements of change can be observed in isolation. The 
facts amassed in this way can be used for induction, a peculiar proce- 
dure of inference which has given pragmatic evidence of its ex- 
pediency, although its satisfactory epistemological characterization 
is still an unsolved problem. 

The experience with which the sciences of human action have 
to deal is always an experience of complex phenomena. No laboratory 
experiments can be performed with regard to human action. We are 
nevcr in a position to observe the change in one element only, all 
other conditions of the event being equal to a case in which the 
element concerned did not change. Historical experience as an ex- 
perience of complex phenomena does not provide us with facts in the 
sense in which the natural sciences employ this term to signify isolated 
evcnts tcsted in experiments. The information conveyed by historical 
experience cannot be used as building material for the construction of 
theories and the prediction of future events. Every historical experi- 
ence is open to various interpretations, and is in fact interpreted in 
different ways. 

The postulates of positivism and kindred schools of tnetaphysics are 
therefore illusory. It is impossible to reform thc sciences of human 
action according to the pattern of physics and the other natural 
scicnccs. There is no means to establish an a posteriori theory of 
human conduct and social events. History can neither prove nor 
disprove any general statement in the manner in which the natural 
sciences accept or reject a hypothesis on the ground of laboratory 
experiments. Neither experimental verification nor experimental falsi- 
fication of a general proposition are possible in this field. 

Complex phenomena in the production of which various causal 
chains are interlaced cannot test any theory. Such phenomena, on 
the contrary, become intelligible only through an interpretation in 
tcrms of theories previously developed from other sources. In the 
case of naturaI phenomena the interpretation of an event must not be 
at variance with the theories satisfactorily verified by experiments. In 
the case of historical events there is no such restriction. Commentators 
would be free to resort to quite arbitrary explanations. Where there 
is something to explain, the human mind has never been at a loss to 


Human Action 

invent ad hoc some imaginary theories, lacking any logical justifica- 
tion. 

A limitation similar to that which the experimentally tested theories 
enjoin upon the attempts to interpret and elucidate individual physi- 
cal, chemical, and physiological events is provided by praxeology in 
the field of human history. Praxeology is a theoretical and systematic, 
not a historical, science. Its scope is human action as such, irrespective 
of all environmental, accidental, and individual circumstances of the 
concrete acts. Its cognition is purely formal and general without 
reference to the material content and the particular features of the 
actual case. It aims at knowledge valid for all instances in which the 
conditions exactly correspond to those implied in its assumptions and 
inferences. Its statements and propositions are not derived from ex- 
perience. They are, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori. 
They are not subject to verification or faIsification on the ground of 
expcricnce and facts. They are both logically and temporally anteced- 
ent to any comprehension of historical facts. They are a necessary 
requirement of any intellectual grasp of historical events. Without 
them we should not be able to see in the course of events anything else 
than kalcidoscopic change and chaotic muddle. 

2. The Formal and Aprioristic Character of Praxeology 
A fashionable tendency in contemporary philosophy is to deny 
the existence of any a priori knowledge. ~11 

human knowledge, it is 
contended, is derived from experience. This attitude can easily be 
understood as an excessive reaction against the extravagances of 
theology and a spurious philosophy of history and of nature. Meta- 
physicians were eager to discover by intuition moral preccpts, the 
mcaning of historical evolution, the properties of soul and matter, 
:~ndthe laws governing physical, chemical, and physiological events. 
Their vnlatile peculations manifested n hlithe disregard for matter- 
of-fact Itnowledge. They were convinced that, without reference 
to experience, reason could explain all things and answer a11 questions. 

The modern natural sciences owe their success to the method of 

observation and experiment. There is no doubt that empiricism and 

~ra~rnatism

are right as far as they merely describe the procedures 
of the natural sciences. But it is no less certain that they are entirelv 
n.1-onq in their endeavors to reject any kind of a priori ltnowlcdge and 
to characterize lopic, mathematics, and praxeology as empirical and 
cx~erimental disciplines. 

With regard to praxeology the errors of the philosophers are due 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 

33 

to their complete ignorance of economics and very often to their 
shockingly insufficient knowledge of history. In the eyes of the 
philosopher the treatment of philosophical issues is a sublime and 
noble vocation which must not be put upon the low level of other 
gainful employments. The professor resents the fact that he derives 
an income from philosophizing; lie is offended by the thought that 
he earns money like the artisan and the farm hand. Monetary matters 
are mean things, and the philosopher investigating the eminent prob- 
lems of truth and absolute eternal values should not soil his mind by 
paying attention to them. No line of any contemporary philosopher 
discloses the least familiarity with even the most elementary problems 
of economics. 

The problem of whether there are or whether there are not a 
priori elements of thought-i.e., necessary and ineluctable intellectual 
conditions of thinking, anterior to any actual instance of conception 
and experience-must not bc confused with the genetic problem of 
how man acquired his characteristically human mental ability. ,Man 
is descended from nonhuman ancestors who lacked this abiIity. These 
ancestors were endowed with some potentiality which in the course 
of ages of evolution converted them into reasonable beings. This 
transformation was achieved by the influence of a changing cosmic 
environment operating upon succeeding generations. Hence the 
empiricist concludes that the fundamental principles of reasoning are 
an outcome of experience and represent an adaptation of man to the 
conditions of his environment. 

This idea leads, when consistently followed, to the further con- 
clusion that there were between our prehunian ancestors and homo 
sapiens various intermediate stages. There were beings which, al- 
though not yet equipped with the human faculty of reason, were en- 
dowed with some rudimentary elements of ratiocination. Theirs was 
not pet a logical mind, but a prelogical (or rather imperfectly logical) 
mind. Their desultory and defective logical functions evolved step 
by step from the preiogicai state toward the iog~cal state. Reason, in- 
tellect, and logic are historical phenomena. There is a history of Iogic 
as there is a history of technology. Nothing suggests that logic as we 

z. Hardly any philosopher had a more universal familiarity with various 
branches of contemporary knowIedgc than Bergson. Yet a casual remark in his 
Iast great book clearly proves that Bergson was completely ignorant of the 
fundamental theorem of the modern theory of value and exchange. Speaking of 
exchange he remarks "Yon ne peut le pratiquer sans sl&tre demand6 si les deux 
objets CchangCs sont bien de m&me valeur, c'est-;-dire Cchangeables eontre un 
m&metroisi6me." (Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion [Paris, 19321, 
p. 68.) 

Human Action 

know it is the last and final stage of intellectual evolution. Human 
logic is a historical phase between prehuman nonlogic on the one 
hand and superhuman logic on the other hand. Reason and mind, the 
human beings' mobt ehcacious equipment in their struggle for sur- 
vival, are embedded in the continuous flow of zoological events. They 
are neither eternal nor unchangeable. They are transitory. 

Furthermore, there is no doubt that every human being repeats in 
his personal evolution not only the physiologicaI metamorphosis from 
a simple cell into a highly complicated mammal organism but no less 
the spiritual metamorphosis from a purely vegetative and animal ex- 
istence into a reasonable mind. This transformation is not completed 
in the prenatal life of the embryo, but only later when the newborn 
child step by step awakens to human consciousness. Thus every man 
in his early youth, starting from the depths of darkness, proceeds 
through various states of the mind's logical structure. 

Then there is the case of the animals. We are fully aware of the 
unbridgeable gulf separating our reason from the reactive processes 
of their brains and nerves. But at the same time we divine that forces 
are desperately struggling in them toward the light of comprchcnsion. 
They are like prisoners anxious to break out from the doom of eternal 
darkness and inescapable automatism. We feel with them because 
we ourselves are in a similar position: pressing in vain against the 
limitation of our intellectual apparatus, striving unavailingly after 
unattainable perfect cognition. 

But the problem of the a priori is of a different character. It does 
not deal with the problem of how consciousness and reason have 
emerged. It refers to the essential and necessary character of the 
logical structure of the human mind. 

The fundamental logical relations are not subject to proof or dis- 
proof. Every attempt to prove them must presuppose their validity. 
It is impossible to explain them to a being who would not possess them 
on his own account. Efforts to define them according to thc rules of 
definition must fail. They are primary proposition^ antecedent to 
any nominal or real definition. They are ultimate unanalyzable 
categories. The human mind is utterly incapable of imagining logical 
categories at variance with them. No matter how they may appear to 
superhuman beings, they are for man inescapable and absolutely neces- 
sary. They are the indispensabk prerequisite of perception, apper- 
ception, and experience. 

They are no less an indispensable prerequisite of memory. There 
is a tendency in the natural sciences to describe memory as an instance 
of a more general phenomenon. Every living organism conserpes 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 

the effects of earlier stimulation, and the present state of inorganic 
matter is shaped by the effects of all the influences to which it was 
exposed in the past. The present state of the universe is the product 
of its past. We may, therefore, in a loose metaphorical sense, say 
that the geological structure of our globe conserves the memory of 
all earlier cosmic changes, and that a man's body is the sedimentation 
of his ancestors' and his own destinies and vicissitudes. But memory 
is something entirely different from the fact of the structural unity 
and continuity of cosmic evolution. It is a phenomenon of conscious- 
ness and as such conditioned by the logical a priori. Psychologists have 
been puzzled by the fact that man does not remember anything from 
the time of his existence as an embryo and as a suckling. Freud tried 
to explain this absence of recollection as brought about by subcon- 
scious suppression of undesired reminiscences. The truth is that there 
is nothing to be remembered of unconscious states. Animal automa- 
tism and unconscious response to physiologicaI stim~ilations are 
neither for cinbryos and sucklings nor for adults material for re- 
membrance. Only conscious states can bc remembered. 

The human mind is not a tabula rasa on which the external events 
write their own history. It is equipped with a set of tools for grasping 
reaIity. Man acquired these tools, i.e., the logical structure of his 
mind, in the course of his evolution from an amoeba to his present 
state. But these tools arc lopically prior to any experience. 

Adan is not only an animal totally subject to the stimuli unavoidably 
dctcrmining the circumstances of his life. He is also an acting being. 
And the category of action is logically antecedent to any concrete 
act. 

The fact that man does not hare the creative power to imagine 
categories at variance with the fundamcntal logical relations and with 
the principles of causality and teleology enjoins upon us what may be 
called nzethodological apriorism. 

Everybody in his daily behavior again and again bears witness to the

He who addresses his fellow men, who wants to inform and convince 
them, who asks questions and answers other pcoplc's questions, can 
proceed in this way only because he can appeal to something common 
to all men-namely, the logical structure of human rcason. The idea 
that A could at the same time be non-A or that to prefer A to B could 
at the same time be to prefer B to A is simplv inconceivable and ab- 
surd to a human mind. We are not in the poshion to comprehend any 
kind of prelogical or metalogical thinking. We cannot think of a 
world without causality and teleology. 


Human Action 

It does not matter for man whether or not beyond the sphere ac- 
cessible to the human mind there are other spheres in which there 
is sorncthing categorially different from human thinking and acting. 
No ltnowlcdge from such spheres penetrates to the hunlan mind. It 
is idle to ask whether things-in-themselves are different from what 
they appear to us, and whether there are worlds which we cannot 
divine and ideas which we cannot comprehend. These are problems 
bcyond the scope of human cognition. Human knowledge is condi- 
tioned by the structure of thc human mind. If it chooses human action 
as the subject matter of its inquiries, it cannot mean anything else than 
thc categories of action which are proper to the human mind and arc 
its ~rojection into the external world of becoming and change. All 
the theorems of praxeology refer only to these categories of action 
and are valid only in the orbit of their operation. They do not pre- 
tend to convey any information about never dreamed of and un-
imaginable worlds and relations. 

Thus praxeology is human in a double sense. It is human because 
it claims for its theorems, within the sphere precisely defined in the 
undcrlying assumptions, universal validity for all human action. It 
is human moreover because it dcals only with human action and 
docs not aspire to know about nonhuman-whether subhuman or 
superhuman-action. 

The Alleged Logical Heterogeneity of Primitive Man 

It is a general fallacy to believe that the writings of Lucien LCvy-Bruhl 
give support to the doctrine that the logical structure of mind of primitive 
man was and is categorially different from that of civilized man. On the 
contrary, what 1,kvy-Bruhl, on the basis of a careful scrutiny of the entire 
ethnological material available, reports about the mental functions of primi- 
tive man proves cIearIy that the fundamental logical relations and the 
categories of thought and action play in the intellectual activities of sav- 
ages the same role they play in our own life. The content of primitive man's 
thoughts differs from the content of our thoughts, but the formal and 
logical structure is common to both. 

It is true that Lkvy-Bruhl himself maintains that the mentality of primi- 
tive peoples is essentially "mystic and prelogical" in character; primitive 
man's collective representations are regulated by the "law of participation" 
and are consequently indifferent to the law of contradiction. However, 
Lkvy-Bruhl's distinction between prelogical and logical thinking refers to 
the content and not to the form and categorial structure of thinking. For 
he declares that also among peoples like ourselves ideas and relations be- 
tween ideas governed by the "law of participation" exist, more or less in- 
dependently, more or less impaired, but yet ineradicable, side by side, with 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 

those subject to the law of reasoning. "The prelogical and the mystic are 
co-existent with the logical." 

LCvy-Bruhl relegates the essentiaI teachings of Christianity to the realm 
of the prelogical mind." hTow, many objections can possibly be raised and 
have been raised against the Christian doctrines and their interpretation by 
theology. But nobody ever ventured to contend that the Christian fathers 
and philosophers-among them St. Augustine and St. Thomas-had minds 
whose logica1 structure was categorially different from that of our con- 
temporaries. The dispute between a man who believes in miracles and 
another who does not refers to the content of thought, not to its logical 
form. A man who tries to demonstrate the possibility and reality of 
miracles may err. But to unmask his error is-as the brilliant essays of 
Hume and A4ill show-certainly no less logically intricate than to explode 
any philosophical or econonlic fallacy. 

Explorers and missionaries report that in Africa and Polynesia primitive 
man stops short at his earliest perception of things and never reasons if he 
can in any way avoid kquropean and American educators sometimes 
report the same of their students. With regard to the Mossi on the Niger 
LCvy-Bruhl quotes a missionary's observation: "Conversation with them 
turns only upon women, food, and (in the rainy season) the crops." What 
other subjects did many contemporaries and neighbors of Newton, Kant, 
and LCvy-Uruhl prefer? 

The conclusion to be drawn from IAvy-Bruhl's studies is best expressed 
in his ow-n words: "The primitive mind, like our own, is anxious to find 
the reasons for what happens, but it does not seek these in the same direc- 
tion as we do." 

A peasant eager to get a rich crop may-according to the content of his 
ideas--choose various methods. He may perform some magical rites, he 
may embark upon a pilgrimage, he may offer a candle to the image of his 
patron saint, or he may empIoy more and better fertilizer. But whatever 
he does, it is always action, i.e., the employment of means for the attain- 
ment of ends. Magic is in a broader sense a variety of technology. Exor- 
cisnl is a deliberate purposeful action based on a world view which most 
of our contemporaries condemn as superstitious and thercfore as inap- 
propriate. But the concept of action does not imply that the action is 
guided by a correct theory and a technology prnmising success and that 
it attains the end aimed at. It only implies that the performer of the action 
believcs that the means applied will produce the desired effect. 

No facts provided by ethnology or history contradict the assertion that

the logical structure of mind is uniform with all men of all races, ages, and 
c~untries.~ 

3. The A Priori and Reality 
Aprioristic reasoning is purely conceptual and deductive. It can- 
not produce anything else but tautologies and analytic judgments. All 
its implications are logically derived from the premises and were al- 
ready contained in them. Hence, according to a popular objection, 
it cannot add anything to our knowledge. 

All geometrical theorems are already implied in the axioms. The 
concept of a rectangular triangle already implies the theorem of Py- 
thagoras. This theorem is a tautology, its deduction results in an 
analytic judgment. nlonetheless nobody would contend that geometry 
in general and the theorem of Pythagoras in particular do not enlarge 
our knowledge. Cognition from pureIy deductive reasoning is also 
creative and opens for our mind access to previously barred spheres. 
The significant task of aprioristic reasoning is on the one hand to bring 
into relief all that is implied in the categories, concepts, and premises 
and, on the other hand, to show what they do not imply. It is its 
vocation to render manifest and obvious what was hidden and un- 
known bef0re.O 

In the concept of money all the theorems of monetary theory are 
already implied. The quantity theory docs not add to our knowledge 
anythmg which is not virtually contained in the concept of money. 
It transforms, develops, and unfolds; it only analyzes and is therefore 
tautological like the theorem of Pythagoras in relation to the con- 
cept of the rectangular triangle. However, nobody would deny the 
cognitive value of the quantity theory. To a mind not enlightened 
by economic reasoning it remains unknown. A long line of abortive 
attempts to solve the problems concerned shows that it was certainly 
not easy to attain the present state of knowledge. 

It is not a deficiency of the system of aprioristic science that it does

theorems are mental tools opening the approach to a complete grasp 
of reality; they are, to be sure, not in themselves already the totality 
of factual knowledge about all things. Theory and the comprehension 
of living and changing reality are not in opposition to one another.

Epistemological Problems of Human Action 


39 

Without theory, the general aprioristic science of human action, there 
is no comprehension of thc reality of human action. 

The relation between reason and experience has long been one of 
the fundamental philosophical problems. Like all other problems of 
the critique of knowledge, philosophers have approached it only with 
reference to the natural sciences. They have ignored the sciences of 
human action. Their contributions have been useless for praxeology. 

It is customary in the treatment of the epistemologica1 problems of 
economics to adopt one of the solutions suggested for the natural 
sciences. Some authors recommend Poincart's conventi~nalisrn.~~ 
They regard the premises of economic reasoning as a matter of 
linguistic or postulational convention.ll Others prefer to acquiesce in 
ideas advanced by Einstein. Einstein raises the question: "How can 
mathematics, a product of human reason that does not depend on any 
experience, so exquisitely fit the objects of reality? Is human reason 
able to discover, unaided by experience, through pure reasoning the 
features of real things?" And his answer is: "As far as the theorems 
of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as they 
arc certain, they do not refer to reality." l2 

However, the scicnces of human action differ radically from the nat- 
uraI scicnces. -411 authors eager to construct an epistemological system 
of the sciences of human action according to the pattern of the natural 

-

sciences err lamentably. 

The real thing which is the subject matter of praxeology, human 
action, stems from the same source as human reasoning. Action and 
reason are congeneric and homogeneous; they may even be called 
two different aspects of the same thing. That reason has the power 
to make clear through pure ratiocination the essential features of 
action is a consequence of the fact that action is an offshoot of reason. 
The theorems attained by correct praxeological reasoning are not 
only perfectly certain and incontestable, like the correct mathematical 
theorems. They refer, moreover with the full rigidity of their 
apodiccic cerrainty and incontestabiiity to the reaiity of action as 
it appears in life and history. Praxeology conveys exact and precise 
knowledge of real things. 

The starting point of praxeology is not a choice of axioms and a 
decision about methods of procedu>e, but reflection about the essence 
of action. There is no action in which the praxeological categories

Human Action 
do not appear fulIy and perfectly. There is no mode of action think- 
able in which means and ends or costs and proceeds cannot be clearIy 
distinguished and precisely separated. There is nothing which only 
approximately or incompletely fits the economic category of an 
exchange. There are only exchange and nonexchange; and with re- 
gard to any exchange all the general theorems concerning exchanges 
are valid in their full rigidity and with all their implications. There 
are no transitions from exchange to nonexchange or from direct 
exchange to indirect exchange. So experience can ever be had which 
would contradict these statements. 
Such an experience would be impossible in the first place for the 
reason that all experience concerning human action is conditioned by 
the praxeological categories and becomes possible only through their 
application. If we had not in our mind the schemes provided by praxe- 
ological reasoning, we should never be in a position to discern and to 
grasp any action. We would perceive motions, but neither buying nor 
selling, nor prices, wage rates, interest rates, and so on. It is only 
through the utilization of the praxeological scheme that we become 
able to have an experience concerning an act of buying and selling, 
but then independently of the fact of whether or not our senses con- 
comitantly perceive any motions of men and of nonhuman elements 
of the external world. Unaided bv praxeoIogica1 knowledge we would 
never learn anything about media of exchange. If we approach coins 
without such preexisting knowledge, we would see in them only 
round plates of metal, nothing more. Experience concerning money 
requires familiarity with the praxeological category medium of ex-
chnnge. 

Experience concerning human action differs from that concerning 
natural phenomena in that it requires and presupposes praxeological 
Itnowledge. This is why the methods of the natural sciences are in- 
appropriate for the study of praxeology, economics, and history. 

In asserting the a pi06 character of praxeolopy we are not drafting 
a plan for a f~ltnre new science different from the traditional sciences 
of human action. We do not maintain that the theoretical science of 
human action should be aprioristic, but that it is and always has been 
so. Every attempt to reflect upon the problems raised by human action 
is necessarily bound to aprioristic reasoning. It does not make any 
difference in this regard whether the men discussing a probIem are 
theorists aiming at pure knowledge only or statesmen, politicians, 
and regular citizens eager to comprehend occurring changes and to 
discover what kind of public policy or private conduct would best 
snit their own interests. People may begin arguing about the signif- 


Epistemological Problem of Human Action 

icance of any concrete experience, the debate inevitably turns away 
from the accidental and environmental features of the event con- 
cerned to an analysis of fundamental principles, and imperceptibly 
abandons any reference to the factual happenings which evoked the 
argument. 1he history of the natural sciences is a record of theories 
and hypotheses discarded because they were disproved by experience. 
Remember for instance the fallacies of older mechanics disproved 
by Galileo or the fate of the phlogiston theory. No such case is 
recorded by the history of economics. The champions of logically 
incompatible theories claim the same events as the proof that their 
point of view has been tested by experience. The truth is that the 
experience of a complex phenomenon-and there is no other expe- 
rience in the realm of human action-can always be interpreted on 
the ground of various antithetic theories. Whether the interpreta- 
tion is considered satisfactory or unsatisfactory depends on the ap- 
preciation of the theories in question established beforehand on the 
ground of aprioristic reasoning.18 

History cannot teach us any general rule, principle, or law. There 
is no means to abstract from a historical expericnce a posteriori any 
theories or theorems concerning human conduct and policies. The 
data of history would be nothing but a clumsy accumulation of dis- 
connected occurrences, a heap of confusion, if they could not be 
clarified, arranged, and interpreted by systematic praxeological 
knowledge. 

4. The Principle of Methodological Individualism 
Praxeology deals with the actions of individual men. It is only in 
the further course of its inquiries that cognition of human coopera- 
tion is attained and social action is treated as a special case of the more 
universal category of human action as such. 

This methodological individualism has been vehemently attacked 
by various metaphysical schools and disparaged as a nominalistic fal- 
lacy. The notion of an individual, say the critics, is an empty abstrac- 
tion. Real man is necessarily always a member of a social whole. It is 
even impossible to imagine the existence of a man separated from the 
rest of mankind and not connected with society. Adan as man is the 
product of a social evohtion. His most eminent feature. reason, could 
only emerge within the framework of social mutualit);. There is no 
thinking which does not depend on the concepts and notions of 

13. Cf. E. P. Cheyney, Law in History and Other Essnys (New York, 1927). 
P. 27. 

Human Actio% 

language. But speech is manifestly a social phenomenon. hlan is al- 
ways the member of a collective. As the whole is both logically and 
temporally prior to its parts or ~nembers, the study of the individual 
is posterior to the study of society. The only adequate method for the 
scientific treatment of human problems is the method of universalism 
or collectivism. 

Now the controversy whether the whole or its parts are logically 
prior is vain. Logically the notions of a whole and its parts are cor- 
relative. As logical concepts they are both apart from time. 

Xo less inappropriate with regard to our problem is the reference 
to the antagomsm of realism and nominalism, both these terms being 
understood in the meaning which medieval scholasticism attached to 
them. It is uncontested that in the sphere of human action social en- 
tities have real existence. Nobody ventures to deny that nations, states, 
municipalities, parties, rcligious communities, are real factors deter- 
mining the course of human events. Methodological individualism, 
far from contesting the significance of such collective wholes, con- 
siders it as one of its main tasks to describe and to analyze their be- 
coming and their disappearing, their changing structures, and their 
operation. And it chooses the only method fitted to solve this problem 
satisfactorily. 

First we must realize that all actions arc performed by individuals. 
A collective operates always through the intermediary of one or 
several individuals whose actions are related to the collective as the 
secondary source. It is the meaning which the acting individuals and 
all those who are touched by their action attribute to an action, that 
determines its character. It is the meaning that marks one action as the 
action of an individual and another action as the action of the state or 
of the municipality. The hangman, not the state, cxccutcs a criminal. 
It is the meaning of those concerned that discerns in the hangman's 
action an action of the state. A group of armed men occupies a place. 
It is the meaning of those concerned which imputes this occupation 
not to the officers and soldiers on the spot, but to their nation.-1f we 
scrutinize the meaning of the various actions performed by individuals 
we must necessarily learn everything about the actions of collective 
wholes. For a social collective has no existence and reality outside of 
the individual members' actions. The life of a collective is lived in the 
actions of the individuals constituting% body. There is no social 
collective conceivable which is not operative in the actions of some 
individuals. The reality of a social integer consists in its directing and 
releasing definite actions on the part of individuals. Thus the way to 
a cognition of collective wholes is through an analysis of the in- 
dividuals' actions. 


Epistemological Problems of Hzcnzan Action 

,4s a thinking and acting being man emerges from his prchuman 
existence already as a social being. The evolution of reason, language, 
and cooperation is the outcome of the same process; they were in- 
separably and necessarily linked together. But this process took place 
in individuals. It consisted in changes in the behavior of individuals. 
There is no other substance in which it occurred than the individuals. 
There is no substratum of society other than the actions of individuals. 

That there are nations, states, and churches, that there is social 
cooperation under the division of labor, becomes discernible only in 
the actions of certain individuals. Nobody ever perceived a nation 
without perceiving its members. In this sense one may say that a so- 
cial collective comes into being through the actions of individuals. 
That docs not mean that the individual is temporally antecedent. It 
merely means that definite actions of individuals constitute the col- 
lective. 

Thcre is no need to argue whether a collective is the sum resulting 
from the addition of its elements or more, whether it is a being sui 
generis, and whether it is reasonable or not to speak of its will, plans, 
aims, and actions and to attribute to it a distinct "soul." Such pedantic 
talk is idle. A collective whole is a particular aspect of the actions of 
various individuals and as such a real thing determining the coursc of 
events. 

It is illusory to believe that it is possible to visualize collective 
wholes. They are never visibIe; their cognition is always the outcome 
of the understanding of the meaning which acting men attribute to 
their acts. We can see a crowd, i.e., a multitude of people. Whether 
this crowd is a mere gathering or a mass (in the sensc in which this 
term is used in contemporary psychology) or an organized body or 
any other kind of social entity is a question which can only be an- 
swered by understanding the meaning which they themselves attach 
to their presence. And this meaning is always the meaning of individ- 
oak. Not our senses, but understanding, a mental process, makcs us 
recognize social entities. 

Those who want to start the study of human action from the col- 
lective units encounter an insurmountable obstacle in the fact that 
an individual at the same time can belong and-with the exception 
of the most primitive tribesmen-really belongs to various collective 
entities. The problems raised by the multiplicity of coexisting social 
units and their mutual antagonisms can be solved only by methodolog-
ical individua1ism.l4 

14. See below, pp. 145-1 53, the critique of the collectivist theory of society. 

Human Actio~z 

I and We 

The Ego is the unity of the acting being. It is unquestionably given and 
cannot be dissolved or conjured away by any reasoning or quibbling. 

The We is always the result of a summing up which puts together two 
or more Egos. If somebody says I, no further questioning is necessary in 
order to establish the meaning. The same is valid with regard to the Thou 
and, provided the person in view is precisely indicated, with regard to the 
He. Rut if a rnan says We, further information is needed to denote who the 
Egos are who are comprised in this We. It is always single individuals who 
say We; even if they say it in chorus, it yet remains an utterance of single 
individuals. 

The We cannot act otherwise than each of them acting on his own be- 
half. They can either all act together in accord; or one of them may act 
for them all. In the latter case the cooperation of the others consists in 
their bringing about the situation which makes one man's action effective 
for them too. Only in this scnsc does the officer of a social entity act for 
the whole; the individual members of the collective body either cause or 
allow a single man's action to concern them too. 

The endeavors of psychology to dissolve the Ego and to unmask it as an 
illusion are idle. The praxeological Ego is beyond any doubts. No matter 
what a man was and what he may become later, in the very act of choosing 
and acting he is an Ego. 

From the pluralis logicus (and from the merely ceremonial pluralis 
nlajestaticus) wc must distinguish the pluralis gloriosus. If a Canadian who 
never tried skating says, "We are the world's foremost ice hockey players," 
or if an Italian boor proudly contends "We are the world's most eminent 
painters," nobody is fooled. But with refercnce to politicaI and economic 
problems the pluralis gloriosus evolves into the pluralis impcrialis and as 
such plays a significant role in paving the way for the acceptance of 
doctrines determining international economic policies. 

j. The Principle of Methodological Singularism 
So less than from the action of an individual praxeologp begins its 
investigations from the individual action. It does not deal in vague 
terms with human action in general, but with concrctc action which 
a definite man has performed at a definite date and at a definite place. 
But, of course, it docs not concern itself with the accidental and 
environmental features of this action and with what distinguishes it 
from all other actions, but only with what is necessary and universal 
in its performance. 

The phiIosophy of universalism has from time immemorial blocked 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 

access to a satisfactory grasp of praxeological problems, and contem- 
porary universalists are utterly incapable of finding an approach to 
them. Universalism, collectivism, and conceptual reaIism see only 
wholes and universals. They speculate about mankind, nations, states, 
classes, about virtue and vice, right and wrong, about entire classes 
of wants and of commodities. They ask, for instance: Why is "the" 
value of "gold" higher than that of "iron"? Thus they never find 
solutions, but antinomies and paradoxes only. The best-known in- 
stance is the value-paradox which frustrated even the work of the 
classical economists. 

Praxeology asks: What happens in acting? What docs it mean to 
say that an individual then and there, today and here, at any time and 
at any place, acts? What results if he chooses one thing and rejects 
another? 

'The act of choosing is always a decision among various opportuni- 
ties open to the choosing individual. Man never chooses between 
virtue and vice, but only between two modes of action which we call 
from an adopted point of view virtuous or vicious. A man never 
chooses between "gold" and "iron" in general, but always only be- 
tween a definite quantity of gold and a definite quantity of iron. 
Every single action is strictly limited in its immediate consequences. 
If we want to reach correct conclusions, we must first of all look at 
these limitations. 

Human life is an unceasing sequence of single actions. But the single 
action is by no means isolated. It is a link in a chain of actions which 
together form an action on a higher level aiming at a more distant 
end. Every action has two aspects. It is on the one hand a partial action 
in the framework of a further-stretching action, the performance of 
a fraction of the aims set by a more far-reaching action. It is on the 
other hand itself a whole with regard to the actions aimed at by the 
performance of its own parts. 

It depends upon the scope of the project on which acting man 
is intent 2t the instant whether the mare far-reaching actim er :, 
partial action directed to a more immediate end only is thrown into 
relief. There is no need for praxeology to raise questions of the type 
of those raised by Gestaltpsychologie. The road to the performance 
of great things must aIways lead through the performance of partial 
tasks. A cathedral is something other than a heap of stones joined to- 
gether. But the only procedure for constructing a cathedral is to lay 
one stone upon another. For the architect the whole project is the 
main thing. For the mason it is the single walI, and for the bricklayer 
the single stones. ?Vhat counts for praxeology is the fact that the 


Human Actiof2 

only method to achieve greater tasks is to build from the foundations 
step by step, part by part. 

6. The Individual and Changing Features of 
Human Action 
The content of human action, i.e., the ends aimed at and the means 
chosen and applied for the attainment of these cnds, is determined 
by the personal qualities of every acting man. Individual man is the 
product of a long line of zoological evolution which has shaped his 
physiological inheritance. He is born the offspring and the heir of his 
ancestors, and the precipitate and sediment of all that his forefathers 
experienced are his biological patrimony. When he is born, he does 
not enter the world in general as such, but a definite environment. 
The innate and inherited biological qualities and a1 that life has 
worked upon him make a man what he is at any instant of his pilgrim- 
age. They are his fate and destiny. His will is not "free" in the 
metaphysical sense of this term. It is determined by his background 
and all the influences to which he himself and his ancestors were ex- 
posed. 

Inheritance and environment direct a man's actions. They suggest 
to him both the cnds and the means. He lives not simply as man in 
abstracto; he lives as a son of his family, his race, his people, and his 
age; as a citizen of his country; as a member of a definite social group; 
as a practitioner of a certain vocation; as a follower of definite reli- 
gious, metaphysical, philosophica1, and political ideas; as a partisan in 
many feuds and controversies. He does not himself create his ideas 
and standards of value; hc borrows them from other people. His 
ideology is what his environment enjoins upon him. Only very few 
men have the gift of thinking new and original ideas and of changing 
the traditional body of creeds and doctrines. 

Common man does not specdate about the great problems. With 
regard to them he relies upon other people's authority, he bchavcs 
as "every decent fellow must behave,'' he is like a sheep in the herd. 
It is precisely this intellectual inertia that characterizes a man as a 
common man. Yet the common man does choose. He chooses to adopt 
traditional patterns or patterns adopted by other people because he is 
convinced that this procedure is best fitted to achieve his own wel- 
fare. And he is ready to change his ideology and consequently his 
mode of action whenever he becomes convinced that this would 
better serve his own interests. 

Most of a man's daily behavior is simple routine. He performs 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 

certain acts without paying special attention to them. He does many 
things because he was trained in his childhood to do them, because 
other people behave in the same way, and because it is customary 
in his environment. He acquires habits, he develops automatic re- 
actions. But he indulges in these habits only because he welcomes 
their effects. As soon as he discovers that the pursuit of the habitual 
way may hinder the attainment of ends considered as more desirable, 
he changes his attitude. A man brought up in an area in which the 
water is clean acquires the habit of heedlessly drinking, washing, 
and bathing. When he moves to a place in which the water is polluted 
by morbific germs, he will devote the most careful attention to proce- 
dures about which he never bothered before. He will watch himself 
permanently in order not to hurt himself by indulging unthinkingly 
in his traditionhl routine and his automatic reactions. The fact that 
an action is in the regular course of affairs performed spontaneously, 
as it were, does not mean that it is not due to a conscious volition aid 
to a deliberate choice. Indulgence in a routine which possibly could 
be changed is action. 

Yraxeology is not concerned with the changing content of acting, 
but with its pure form and its categorial structure. The study of the 
accidental and environmental features of human action is the task of 
history. 

7. The Scope and the Specific Method of History 
The study of all the data of experience concerning hunlan action 
is the scope of history. The hjstorian collects and critically sifts all 
available documents. On the ground of this evidence he approaches 
his genuine task. 

It has been asserted that the task of history is to show how events 
actually happened, without imposing presupposirions and values 
(wertfrei, i.e., neutral with regard to all value judgments). The 
historian's report should be a faithful image of the past, an intellectuaI 
photograph, as it were, giving a complete and unbiased description of 
all facts. It should reproduce before our intellectual eye the past with 
all its features. 

hTow,a real reproduction of the past would require a duplication 
not humanly possible. History is not an intellectual reproduction, but 
a condensed representation of the past in conceptual terms. The 
historian does not simply let the events speak for themselves. He ar- 
ranges them from the aspect of the ideas underlying the formation of 
the general notions he uses in their presentation. He does not report 
facts as they happened, but only relevant facts. He does not approach 


Human Action 

the documents without presuppositions, but equipped with the whole 
apparatus of his age's scientific knowledge, that is, with all the teach- 
ings of contemporary logic, mathematics, praxcology, and natural 
sclence. 

It is obvious that the historian must not be biased by any prejudices 
and party tenets. Those writers who consider historical events as an 
arsenal of weapons for the conduct of their party feuds are not 
hisrorians but propagandists and apologists. They are not eager to 
acquire knowledge but to justify the program of their parties. They 
are fighting for the dogmas of a n~etaphysical, religious, national, po- 
litical, or social doctrine. They usurp the name of history for their 
writings as a blind in order to deceive the credulous. A historian 
must first of all aim at cognition. He must free himself from any 
partiality. He must in this sensc be neutral with regard to any value 
judgments. 

This postulate of Wertfieiheit can easily be satisfied in the field 
of the aprioristic science-logic, mathematics, and praxeology-and 
in the field of the experimental natural sciences. It is logically not 
difficult to draw a sharp line between a scientific, unbiased treat- 
ment of these disciplines and a treatmknt distorted by superstition, 
preconceived ideas, and passion. It is much more difficult to comply 
with the requirement of valuational neutrality in history. For the 
subject matter of history, the concrete accidental and environmental 
content of human action, is value judgments and their projection into 
the reality of change. At every step of his activities the historian 
is concerned with value judgments. The value judgments of the men 
whose actions he reports are the substratum of his investigations. 

It has been asserted that the historian himself cannot avoid judg- 

ments of value. No historian-not even the naive chronicler or news- 

paper reporter-registers all facts as they happen. He must discrim- 

inate, he must select some events which he deems worthy of being 

registered and pass over in silence other events. This choice, it is said, 

implies in itself a value judgment. It is necessarily conditioned by the 

historian's world view and thus not impartiaI but an outcome of pre- 

conceived ideas. History can never be anything else than distortion 

of facts; it can never be really scientific, that is neutral with regard 

to values and intent only upon discovering truth. 

There is, of course, no doubt that the discretion which the selection 

of facts places in the hands of the historian can be abused. It can and 

does happen that the historian's choice is guided by party bias. How- 

ever, the problems involved are much more intricate than this popu- 

lar doctrine would have us believe. Their solution must be sought on 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 

the ground of a much more thorough scrutiny of the methods of 

history. 

In dealing with a historical problem the historian makes use of all 
the knowledge provided by logic, mathematics, the natural sciences, 
and especiaIly by praxeology. However, the mental tools of these 
nonhistorical disciplines do not suffice for his task. They are indis- 
pensable auxiliaries for him, but in themselves they do Aot make it 
possible to answer those questions he has to dcal with. 

The course of history is determined by the actions of individuals 
and by the effects of these actions. The actions are determined by the 
value judgments of the acting individuals, i.e., the ends which they 
were eager to attain, and by the means which they applied for the 
attainment of these ends. The choice of the means is an outcome of 
the whole body of technological knowledge of the acting individuals. 
It is in many instances possible to appreciate the effects of the means 
applied from the point of view of praxcologv or of the natural 
sciences. But there remain a great many things for the elucidation of 
which no such help is available. 

The specific task of history for which it uses a specific method is 
the study of these value judgments and of the effects of the actions 
as far as they cannot be analyzed by the teachings of a11 other branches 
of knowledge. The historian's genuine problem is always to interpret 
things as they happened. But he cannot solve this problem on the 
ground of the theorems provided by all other sciences alone. There al- 
ways remains at the bottom of each of his problems something which 
resists analysis at the hand of these teachings of other sciences. It is 
these individual and unique characteristics of each event which are 
studied by the zcnderstanding. 

The uniqueness or individuality which remains at the bottom of 
cvcry historical fact, when a11 the means for its interpretation provided 
bv logic, mathematics, praxeology, and the natural sciences have been 
exhausted, is an ultimate datum. But whereas the natural sciences 
cannot say anything about their uitimate data than that they are 
wch, history can try to make its ultimate data intelligible. Although 
it is impossible to reduce them to their causes-they would not be 
rrltimatc data if such a reduction were possible-the historian can 
understand them because he is himself a human being. In the philoso- 
phy of Rergson this understanding is called an intuition, viz., "la 
sympathie par laquelle on se transporte a l'interieur d'un objet pour 
coi'ncider avcc ce clu'il a d'unique et par cons6quent d'inexprimable." l5 
German epistemology calls this act das spezifische Verstehen der 

15. Hcnri Bergson, La Pens& et le nzouaant (4th ed. Paris, 1934)~p. 205. 

Human Action 
Geisteswisscnschaftenor simply Verstehen.It is the net hod which all 
historians and a11 other people always apply in commenting upon hu-
man events of the past and in forecasting future events. The discovery 
and the delimitation of understanding was one of the most important 
contributions of modern epistemology. It is, to bc sure, neither a proj- 
ect for a new science which does not yet exist and is to be founded 
nor the recommendation of a new method of procedure for any of 
the already existing sciences. 
The understanding must not be confused with approval, be it only 
conditional and circumstantial. The historian, the ethnologist, and 
the psychologist sometimes register actions which are for their feel- 
ings simply repulsive and disgusting; they understand them only as 
actions, i.e., in establishing the underlying aims and the technological 
and praxeoIogica1 methods applied for their execution. To under- 
stand an individual case does not mean to justify or to excuse it. 
Neither must understanding be confused with the act of aesthetic 
enjoyment of a phenomenon. Empathy (Einfiihlung) and under- 
standing are two radically different attitudes. It is a different thing, 
on the one hand, to understand a work of art historically, to deter- 
mine its place, its meaning, and its importance in the flux of events, 
and, on the other hand, to appreciate it emotionally as a work of art. 
One can look at a cathedral with the eyes of a historian. But one can 
look at the same cathedral either as an enthusiastic admirer or as an 
unaffected and indifferent sightseer. The same individuals are capable 
of both modes of reaction, of the aesthetic appreciation and of the 
scientific grasp of understanding. 
The understanding establishes the fact that an individual or a 
group of individuals have engaged in a definite action cmanating 
from definite value judgments and choices and aiming at definite 
ends, and that they have applied for the attainment of these ends 
definite means suggested by definite technological, therapeutical, 
and praxeological doctrines. It furthermore tries to appreciate the 
effects and the intensity of the effects brought about by an action; it 
tries to assign to every action its relevance, i.e., its bearing upon the 
course of events. 
The scope of understanding is the mental grasp of phenomena 
which cannot be totally elucidated by logic, mathematics, praxeology, 
and thc natural sciences to the extent that they cannot be cleared up 
by all these sciences. It must nevcr contradic; the teachings of these 
other branches of kn~wledge.'~ The real corporeal existence of the

devil is attested by innumerable historical doc~unents which are 
rather reliable in all other regards. NIany tribunals in due process of 
law have on the basis of the testimony of witnesses and the confes- 
sions of defendants established the fact that the devil had carnal 
intercourse with witches. However, no appeal to understanding 
could justify a historian's attempt to maintain that the devil really 
existed and interfered with human events otherwise than in the 
visions of an excited human brain. 

While this is generally admitted with regard to the natural sciences, 
there are some historians who adopt another attitude with regard to 
economic theory. They try to oppose to the theorems of economics 
an appeal to documents allegedly proving things incompatible with 
these theorems. They do not realize that complex phenomena can 
neither prove nor disprove any theorem and therefore cannot bear 
witness against any statement of a theory. Economic history is pos- 
sible only because there is an econon~ic theory capable of throwing 
light upon economic actions. If there were no economic theory, re- 
ports concerning economic facts would be nothing Inore than a col- 
lection of unconnected data open to any arbitrary interpretation. 

8. Conception and Understanding 
The task of the sciences of human action is the comprehension of 
the meaning and relevance of human action. They apply for this 
purpose two different epistemological procedures: conception and 
understanding. Conception is the mental tool of praxeology; under- 
standing is the specific mental tool of history. 

The cognition of praxeology is conceptual cognition. It refers to 
what is necessary in human action. It is cognition of universals and 
categories. 

The cognition of history refers to what is unique and individual in 
each event or class of events. It analyzes first each object of its studies 
with the aid of the mental tooh provided by all other sciences. Having 
achieved this preliminary work, it faces its own specific problem: 
the elucidation of the unique and individual features of the case by 
means of the understanding. 

As was mentioned above, it has been assertcd that history can never 
be scientific because historical understanding depcnds on the histori- 
an's subjective value judgments. Understanding, it is maintained, is 
only a euphemistic term for arbitrariness. The writings of historians 
are always one-sided and partial; they do not report the facts; they dis- 
tort them. 


Human Action 

It is, of course, a fact that we have historical books written from 
various points of view. There are historics of the Reformation written 
from the Catholic point of view and others w-ritten from the Protestant 
point of view. There are "proIetarian" histories and "bourgeois" his- 
tories, Tory historians and Whig historians; every nation, party, and 
linguistic group has its own historians and its own ideas about history. 

But the problem which these differences of interpretation offer 
must not be confused with the intentional distortion of facts by propa- 
gandists and apologists parading as historians. Those facts which can 
be established in an unquestionable way on the ground of the source 
material available must be established as thp, preliminary work of the 
historian. This is not a field for understanding. It is a task to be ac- 
complished by the employment of the tools provided by all non- 
historical sciences. The phenomena are gathcred by cautious critical 
observation of the records availabk. As far as the theories of rne 
nonhistorical sciences on which the historian grounds his critical ex- 
amination of the sources are reasonably reliable and certain, there 
cannot be any arbitrary disagreement with regard to the establish- 
ment of the phenomena as such. What a historian asserts is either 
correct or contrary to fact, is either proved or disproved by the 
documents available, or vague becausc the sources do not provide us 
with sufficient information. The experts may disagree, but only on 
the ground of a reasonable interpretation of the evidence available. 
The discussion does not allow any arbitrary statements. 

However, the historians very often do not agree with regard to 
the teachings of the nonhistorical sciences. Then, of course, disagree- 
ment with regard to the critical examination of the records and to 
the conclusions to be drawn from them can ensue. An unbridgeable 
conflict arises. But its cause is not an arbitrariness with regard to the 
concrete historical phenomenon. It stems from an undecided issue 
referring to the nonhistorical sciences. 

An ancient Chinese historian could report that the emperor's sin 
brought about a catastrophic drought and that rain fcll again when 
the ruler had atoned for his sin. No modern historian would accept 
such a report. The underlying meteorological doctrine is contrary to 
uncontested fundamentals of contemporary natural science. But no 
such unanimity exists in regard to many theological, biological, and 
economic issues. Accordingly historians disagree. 

A supporter of the racial doctrine of Xordic-Aryanism will dis- 
regard as fabulous and simply unbelievable any report concerning in- 
tellectual and moral achievements of "inferior" races. He will treat 
such reports in the same way in which all modern historians deal 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 53 

with the above-mentioned Chinese report. No agreement with re- 
gard to any phenomenon of the histov of Christianity can be attained 
between people for whom the gospeis are Holy Writ and people in 
whose eyes they are human documents. Catholic and Protestant his- 
torians disagree about many questions of fact because they start 
from different theological ideas. A Mercantilist or Neo-Mercantilist 
must necessarily be at variance with an economist. An account of 
German monetary history in the years 1914to 1923 is conditioned 
by the author's monetary doctrines. The facts of the French Revolu- 
tion are presented in a quite different manner by those who believe 
in the sacred rights of the anointed king and those who hold other 
views. 

The historians disagree on such issues not in their capacity as 
historians, but in their application of the nonhistorical sciences to 
the subject matter of history. They disagree as agnostic doctors dis- 
agree in regard to the miracles of Lourdes with the members of the 
medical committee for the collection of evidence concerning these 
miracles. Only those who believe that facts write their own story 
into the tabula rasa of the human mind blame the historians for such 
differences of opinion. They faiI to realize that history can never be 
studied without presuppositions, and that dissension with regard to 
the presuppositions, i.e., the whole content of the nonhistorical 
branches of Itnowledge, must determine the establishment of historical 
facts. 

These presuppositions also determine the historian's decision con- 
cerning the choice of facts to be ~nentioned and those to be omitted 
as irrelevant. In searching for the causes of a cow's not giving milk 
a modern veterinarian will disregard entirely all reports concerning 
a witch's evil eye; his view would have been different three hundred 
years ago. In the same way the historian selects from the indefinite 
multitude of events that preceded the fact he is dealing with those 
which could have contributed to its emergence-or have delayed it

sciences, could not have influenced it. 

Changes in the teachings of the nonhistorical sciences consequently 
must involve a rewriting of history. Every generation must treat 
anew the same historical problems because they appear to it in a 
different light. The theological world view of older times led to a 
treatment of history other than the theorems of modern natural 
science. Subjective economics produces historica1 works very dif- 
ferent from those based on mercantilist doctrines. Asfar as divergences 
in the books of historians stem from these disagreements, they are 


Human Action 

not an outcome of aIleged vagueness and precariousness in historical 
studies. They are, on the contrary, the result of the lack of unanimity 
in the realm of those other sciekes which are popularly called cer- 
tain and exact. 

To avoid any possible misunderstanding it is expedient to em-
phasize some further points. The divergences referred to above 
must not be confused: 

I. With p~~rposeful 
ill-intentioned distortion of facts. 

2. With attempts to justify or to condemn any actions from a legal 
or moral point of view. 
3. With the merely incidental insertion of remarks expressing value 
judgments in a strictly objective representation of the state of affairs. 
A treatise on bacteriology does not lose its objectivity if the author, 
accepting the human viewpoint, considers the preservation of human 
life as an ultimate end and, applying this standard, labels effective 
methods of fighting germs good and fruitless methods bad. A germ 
writing such a book would reverse these judgments, but the material 
content of its book would not differ from that of the human bacteri- 
ologist. In the same way a European historian dealing with the 
Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century may speak of "favorable" 
and "unfavorable" events because he takes the standpoint of the 
European defenders of Western civilization. But this approval of one 
party's standard of value need not necessarily interfere with the 
material content of his study. It may-from the viewpoint of con- 
temporary knowledge-be absolutely objective. A Mongolian his- 
torian could endorse it completely but for such casual remarks. 
4. With a representation of one party's action in diplomatic or 
inilitarv antagonisms. The clash of conflicting groups can be dealt 
with from the point of view of the ideas, motives, and aims which im- 
pelled either side's acts. For a full comprehension of what happened 
it is necessary to take account of what was done on both sides. The 
outcome was the result of the interaction of both parties. But in 
order to understand their actions the historian must try to see things 
as they appeared to the acting men at the critical time, not only as 
we see them now from the point of view of our present-day knowl- 
edge. A history of ~incoln's poIicy in the weeks and months pre- 
ceding the outbreak of the Civil War is of course incomplete. But no 
historical study is complete. Regardless of whether the historian sym- 
pathizes with the Unionists or w-ith the Confederates or whether he is 
absolutely neutral, he can deal in an objective way with Lincoln's 
policy in the spring of 1861. Such an investigation is an indispensable 

Epistewological Problems of Human Action

preliminary to answering the broader question of how the Civil War 
broke out. 

Now finally, having settled these problems, it is possible to attack 
the genuine question: Is there any subjective element in historical 
understanding, and if so, in what manner does it determine the re- 
sult of historical studies? 

As far as the task of understanding is to establish the facts that 
people were motivated by definite value judgments and aimed at 
definite means, there cannot be any disagreement among true his- 
torians, is., people intent upon cognition of past events. There may 
be uncertainty because of the insufficient information provided by 
the sources available. But this has nothing to do with understanding. 
It refers to the preliminary work to be achieved by the historian. 

But understanding has a second task to fulfill. It must appraise the 
effects and the intensity of the effects brought about by an action; 
it must deal with the relevance of each motive and each action. 

Here we are faced with one of the main differences between physics 
and chemistry on the one band and the sciences of human action on 
the other. In the realm of physical and chemical events there exist 
(or, at least, it is generally assumed that there exist) constant rcla- 
tions between magnitudes, and man is capable of discovering these 
constants with a reasonable degree of precision by means of laboratory 
experiments. No such constant relations exist in the field of human 
action outside of physical and chemical technology and therapeutics. 
For some time economists believed that they had discovered such a 
constant relation in the effects of changes in the quantity of money 
upon commodity prices. It was asserted that a rise or fall in the 
quantity of money in circulation must result in proportional changes 
of commodity prices. Modern economics has clearly and irrefutably 
exposed the fallaciousness of this statcment.17 Those economists 
who want to substitute "quantitative economics" for what they call 
"qualitative economics" are utterly mistaken. There are, in the field 
of economics, no constant relations, and consequently no measure- 
ment is possible. If a statistician detcrrnines that a rise of 10 per cent 
in the supply of potatoes in Atlantis at a definite time was followed 
by a fall of 8 pcr cent in the price, he does not establish anything 
about what happened or may happen with a change in the supply of 
potatoes in another country or at another ti~ne. He has not "measured" 
the "elasticity of demand" of potatoes. He has established a unique 
and individual historical fact. No intelligent man can doubt that the 

17. See below, pp. 408-410. 

5 6 Human Action 

behavior of men with regard to potatoes and every other commodity 
is variable. Different individuals value the same things in a different 
way, and valuations change with the same individuals with changing 
conditions.ls 

Outside of the field of economic history nobody ever ventured to 
maintain that constant relations prevail in human history. It is a fact 
that in the armed conflicts fought in the past between Europeans 
and backward peoples of other races, one European soldier was 
usually a match for several native fighters. But nobody was ever 
foolish enough to "measurc" the magnitude of European superiority. 

The impracticability of measurement is not due to the lack of 
technical methods for the establishment of measure. It is due to the 
absence of constant relations. If it were only caused by technical 
insufficiency, at least an approximate estimation would be possible 
in some cases, But the main fact is that there are no constant relations. 
Economics is not, as ignorant positivists repeat again and again, back- 
ward because it is not "quantitative." It is not quantitative and does 
not measure because there are no constants. Statistical figures refer- 
ring to economic events are historical data. They tell us what hap- 
pened in a nonrepeatable historical case. Physical events can be inter- 
preted on the ground of our knowledge concerning constant rela- 
tions established by experiments. E-Iistorical cvents are not open to 
such an interpretation. 

The historian can enumerate all the factors which cooperated 

in bringing about a known effect and all the factors which worked 

against them and may have resulted in delaying and mitigating the 

final outcome. But he cannot coordinate, except by understanding, 

the various causative factors in a quantitative way to the effects pro- 

duced. He cannot, except by understanding, assign to each of n factors 

its role in producing the effect P. Understanding is in the realm of 

history the equivalent, as it were, of quantitative analysis and measure- 

ment. 

Technology can tell us how thick a steel plate must be in order not 

to be pierced by a bullet fired at a distance of 300 yards from a 

Winchester rifle. It can thus answer the question why a man who 

took shelter behind a steel plate of a known thickness was hurt or 

not hurt by a shot fired. History is at a loss to explain with the same 

assurance why there was a rise in the price of milk of 10per cent or 

why President Roosevelt defeated Governor Dewey in the election 

of 1944 or why France was from 1870 to 1940 under a republican 

18. Cf, below, p. 348. 

Epistenzological Problem of Human Action 

constitution. Such problems do not allow any treatment other than 
that of understanding. 

To every historical factor understanding tries to assign its reIevance. 
In the excrcise of understanding there is no room for arbitrariness 
and capriciousness. The freedom of the historian is limited bv his 
endeavor to provide a satisfactory explanation of reality. His guiding 
star must be the search for truth. But there necessarily enters into 
understanding an element of subjectivity. The understanding of 
the historian is always tinged with the marks of his personality. It 
reflects the mind of its author. 

The a priori sciences-logic, mathematics, and praxeology-aim at 
a knowledge unconditionally valid for all beings endowed with the 
logical structure of the human mind. The natural sciences aim at a 
cognition valid for a11 those beings which are not only endowed with 
the faculty of human reason but with human senses. The uniformity 
of human-logic and sensation bestows upon thesc branches of knowl- 
edge the character of universal validity. Such at least is the prin- 
ciple guiding the study of the physicists. Only in recent years have 
they begun to see the limits of their endeavors and, abandoning the 
excessive pretensions of older physicists, discovered the "uncertainty 
principle." They realize today that there are unobservables whose 
unobservability is a matter of cpistemological principle.lD 

Historical understanding can never produce results which must be 
accepted bv all men. Two historians who fully agree with regard 
to the teachings of the nonhistorical sciences and with regard to the 
cstabIishment of the facts as far they can be established without 
recourse to the understanding of relevance, may disagree in their 
understanding of the relevance of these facts. They may fully agree 
in establishing that the factors a, b, and c worked together in pro- 
ducing the effect P; nonetheless they can widely disagree with re-
gard to the relcvance of the respective contributions of a, b, and c 
to the final outcome. As f3r as understanding aims at assigning its 
relevance to each factor, it is open to the influence of subjective judg- 
ments. Of course, these are not judqments of value, they do not ex- 
press preferences of the historian. They arc judgments of relevance.*O

Historians may disagree for various reasons. They may hold differ- 
ent views with regard to the teachings of the nonhistorical sciences; 
they may base their reasoning on a more or less complete familiarity 
with the records; they may differ in the understanding of the motives 
and aims of the acting men and of the means applied by them. All 
these differences are open to a settlement by "objective" reasoning; 
it is possible to reach a universal agreement with regard to them. But 
as far as historians disagree with regard to judgments of relevance it 
is i~npossibIe to find a solution which a11 sane men must accept. 

The intellectual methods of science do not differ in kind from 
those applied by the common man in his daily mundane reasoning. 
The scientist uses the same tools which the layman uses; he merely 
uses them skiIIful1~~ is not a

more and cautiously. Understanding 
privilege of the historians. It is everybody's business. In observing the 
conditions of his environment everybody is a historian. Everybody 
uscs understanding in dcaling with the uncertainty of future events 
to which he must adjust his own actions. The distinctive reasoning 
of the speculator is an understanding of the relevance of the various 
factors determining future events. And-let us emphasize it even at 
this early point of our investigations-action necessarily always aims 
at futurc and therefore uncertain conditions and thus is always spec- 
ulation. Acting man looks, as it were, with the eyes of a historian 
into the future. 

Natural History and Human History 

Cosmogony, geology, and the history of biological changes are historical 
disciplines as they deal with unique events of the past. However, they 
operate exclusively with the epistemologica1 methods of the natural 
sciences and have no need for understanding. They must sometimes take 
recourse to only approximate estimates of magnitudes. But such estimates 
are not judgments of relevance. They are a less perfect method of de- 
termining quantitative relations than is "exact" measurement. They must 
not be confused with the state of affairs in the field of human action which 
is characterized by the absence of constant relations. 

If we speak of history, what we have in mind is only the history of 
human action, whose specific mental tool is understanding. 

The assertion that modern naturaI science owes all its achievements to 
the experimental method is so~netimes assailed by referring to astronomy. 
Now, modern astronomy is ~3sentially an application of the physical laws, 
experimentally discovered on the earth, to the celestial bodies. In earlier 
days astronomy was mainly based on the assumption that the movements 
of the celestial bodies would not change their course. Copernicus and 
Kepler simply tried to guess in what kind of curve the earth moves around 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action

the sun. As the circle was considered the "most perfect" curve, Copernicus 
chose it for his theory. Later, by similar guesswork, Iiepler substituted the 
ellipse for the circle. Only since Newton's discoveries has astronomy be- 
come a natural science in the strict sense. 

9. On Ideal Types 
History deals with unique and unrcpeatable events, with the ir-
reversible flux of human affairs. A historical event cannot be described 
without reference to the persons involved and to the place and date 
of its occurrence. As far as a happening can be narrated without such 
a reference, it is not a historical event but a fact of the natural sciences. 

.-

lhe report that Professor X on February 20, 1945, performed a 
certain experiment in his laboratory is an account of a historical 
event. The physicist believes that he is right in abstracting from the 
person of the experimenter and the date and place of the experiment. 
He relates only those circumstances which, in his opinion, are 
relevant for the production of the result achieved and, w-hen repeated, 
will produce the same result again. He transforms the historical event 
into a fact of the empirical natural sciences. He disregards the active 
interference of the experimenter and tries to imagine him as an in- 
different observer and relater of unadulterated reality. It is not the 
task of praxeology to deal with the epistemological issues of this 
philosophy. The physicists themselves are at last on the way to dis- 
covering the flaw in the godlikeness they used to arrogate to them- 
selves. 

Although unique and unrepeatable, historicaI events have one com- 
mon feature: they are human action. History comprehends them as 
human actions; it conceives their meaning by the instrumentality of 
praxeological cognition and understands their meaning in looking at 
their individual and unique features. What counts for history is al- 
ways the meaning of the men concerned: the meaning that they 
attach to the state of affairs they want to alter, the meaning they 
attach to their actions, and the meaning they attach to the effects 
produced by the actions. 

The aspect from which history arranges and assorts the infinite 
lnultiplicity of events is their meaning. The only principle which it 
applies for the systemization of its objects-men, ideas, institutions, 
social entities, and artifacts-is meaning affinity. According to mean- 
ing affinity it arranges the ekmcnts into ideal types. 

Ideal types are the specific notions employed in historical research 
and in the representation of its results. They are concepts of under- 


Humam Action 

standing. As such they are entirely different from praxeological cate- 
gorles and concepts and from the concepts of the natural sciences. 
An ideal type is not a class concept, because its description does not 
indicate the marks whose presence definitely and unambiguously 
determines class membership. An ideal type cannot be defined; it 
must be characterized by an enumeration of those features whose 
presence by and large decides whether in a concrete instance we are 
or are not faced with a specimen belonging to the ideal type in ques- 
tion. It is peculiar to the ideal type that not all its characteristics need 
to be present in any one example. Whether or not the absence of 
some characteristics prevents the inclusion of a concrete specimen 
in thc ideal type in question, depends on a relevance judgment by 
understanding. The ideal type itself is an outcome of an understand- 
ing of the motives, ideas, and aims of the acting individuals and of 
the means they apply. 

An ideal type has nothing at all to do with statistical means and 
averages. Most of the characteristics concerned are not open to a 
numerical determination, and for this reason alone they could not 
enter into a calculation of averages. But the main reason is to be seen 
in something else. Statistical averages denote the behavior of the 
members of a class or a type, already constituted by means of a def- 
inition or characterization referring to other marks, with regard 
to features not referred to in the definition or characterization. The 
membership of the class or type must bc known before the statistician 
can start investigating special features and use the result of this in- 
vestigation for the establishment of an average. We can establish 
the average age of the United States Senators or we can reckon 
averages concerning the behavior of an age class of the pppulation 
with regard to a special problem. But it is logically impossible to 
make the ~nembership of a class or type depend upon an average. 

So historical problem can be treated without the aid of ideal types. 
Even when the historian deals with an individual person or with a 
single event, he cannot avoid referring to idea1 types. If he speaks of 
Napoleon, he must refer to such ideal types as commander, dictator, 
revolutionary leader; and if he deals with the French Revolution he 
must refer to ideal types such as revolution, disintegration of an 
established regime, anarchy. It may be that the reference to an ideal 
type consists merely in rejecting its applicability to the case in ques- 
tion. But all historical events are described and interpreted by means 
of ideal types. The layman too, in dealing with events of the past or 
of the future, must always make use of ideal types and unwittingly 
always does so. 


Epistemological Problem of Human Action 6 I 

Whether or not the employment of a definite ideal type is expedient 
and conducive to an adequate grasp of phenomena can only be de- 
cided by understanding. It is not the ideal type which determines 
the moie of understanding; it is the mode of understanding that re- 
quires the construction and use of corresponding ideal types. 

The ideal types are constructed with the use of ideas and concepts 
dcveloped by all nonhistorical branches of knowledge. Every cogni- 
tion of history is, of course, conditioned by the findings of the other 
sciences, depends upon them, and must never contradict them. But 
historical knowledge has another subject matter and another method 
than these other sciences, and they in turn have no use for under- 
standing. Thus the ideal types must not be confused with concepts 
of the nonhistorical sciences. This is valid also with regard to the 
praxeological categories and concepts. They provide, to be sure, the 
indispensable mental tools for the study of history. However, they 
do not refer to the understanding of the unique and individual events 
which are the subject matter of history. An ideal type can therefore 
never be a simple adoption of a praxeological concept. 

It happens in many instances that a term used by praxeology to 
signify a praxeological concept serves to signify an ideal type for the 
historian. Then the historian uses one word for the expression of two 
diffcrent things. He applies the term sometimes to signify its prax- 
eological connotation, but more often to signify an ideal type. In 
the latter case the historian attaches to the word a meaning different 
from its praxeological meaning; he transforms it by transferring it to 
a different field of inquiry. The two terms connote different things; 
they are homonyms. The economic concept "entrepreneur" belongs 
to a stratum other than the ideal tvpe "entrepreneur" as used by 
economic history and descriptive economics. (On a third stratum 
lies the legal term "entrepreneur.") The economic term "entrepre- 
neur" is a precisely defined concept which in the framework of 
a theory of market economy signifies a clearly integrated func-

same members. hTobody in using it thinks of shoeshine boys, cab 
drivers who own their cars, small businessmen, and small farmers. 
\%'hat economics establishes with regard to entrepreneurs is rigidly 
valid for a11 members of the class without any regard to temporal and 
geographica1 conditions and to the various branches of business. What 
economic history establishes for its ideal types can differ according 
to the particular circumstances of various ages, countries, branches 
of business, and many other conditions. History has little use for a 

z I. See below,pp. 252-256.

general ideal type of entrepreneur. It is more concerned with such 
types as: the American entrepreneur of the time of Jefferson, Ger- 
man heavy industries in the age of William 11, New England textile 
manufacturing in the last decades preceding the first World War, 
the Protestant haute finance of Paris, self-made entrepreneurs, and 
SO on. 

Whether the use of a definite ideal type is to be recommended or 
not depends entirely on the mode of understanding. It is quite com- 
rnon nowadays to employ two ideal types: Left-Wing Parties 
(Progressives) and Right-Wing Parties (Fascists). The former in- 
cludes the Western democracies, some Latin American dictatorships, 
and Russian Bolshevism; the latter Italian Fascism and German Nazism. 
This typification is the outcome of a definite mode of understand- 
ing. Another mode would contrast Democracy and Dictatorship. 
Then Russian 13olshevism, Italian Fascism, and German ATazism be- 
long to the ideal type of dictatorial government, and the Western 
systems to the ideal type of democratic government. 

It was a fundamental mistake of the Historical School of Wirt- 
schaftliche Stnats.ruissenschaftElz in Germany and of Institutionalism 
in America to interpret economics as the characterization of the be- 
havior of an ideal type, the homo oeconomicus. According to this 
doctrine traditional or orthodox economics does not deal with the 
behavior of man as he really is and acts, but with a fictitious or hypo- 
thetical image. It pictures a being driven exclusively by "economic" 
motives, is., solely by the intention of making the greatest possible 
material or monetary profit. Such a being docs not have and never 
did have a counterpart in reality; it is a phantom of a spurious arm- 
chair philosophy. hTo man is exclusively motivated by the desire to 
become as rich as possible; many are not at all influenced by this 
*lean craving. It is vain to refer to such an illusory homunculus in 
dealing with life and history. 

Even if this really were the meaning of classical economics, the 
homo oeconomicus would certainly not be an ideal type. The ideal 
type is not an embodiment of one side or aspect of man's various aims 
2nd desires. It is always the representation of complex phenomena 
of reality, either of tnen, of institutions, or of ideologies. 

The d~assical economists sought to explain the formation of prices. 
Thev were fully aware of the fact that prices are not a product of the 
actiGities of a special group of people, but the result of an interplay 
of all members of the market society. This was the meaning of their 
statement that demand and supply determine the formation of prices. 
However, the classical economists failed in their endeavors to pro- 


Epistemological Problem of Human Action 63 

vide a satisfactory theory of value. They were at a loss to find a 
soIution for the apparent paradox of value. They were puzzled by 
thc alleged paradox that "gold" is more highly valued than "iron," 
although the latter is more "useful" than the former. Thus they could 
not construct a general theory of value and could not trace back the 
~henomena of market exchange and of production to their ultimate 
sources, the behavior of the consumers. This shortcoming forced 
them to abandon their ambitious plan to develop a general theory of 
human action. They had to satisfy themselves with a theory explain- 
ing only the activities of the businessman without going back to the 
choices of everybody as the ultimate determinants. They dealt only 
with the actions of businessmen eager to buy in the cheapest market 
and to sell in the dearest. The consamer was left outside the field of 
their theorizing. Later the epigones of classical economics explained 
and justified this insufficiency as an intentional and methodologically 
necessary procedure. It was, they asserted, the deliberate design 
of the economists to restrict their investigations to only one aspect 
of human endeavor-namely, to the "economic" aspect. It was their 
intention to use the fictitious image of a man driven solely by "eco- 
nomic" motives and to neglect all others although they were fully 
aware of the fact that real men are driven by many other, "non- 
economic" motives. To deal with these other motives, one group of 
these interpreters maintained, is not the task of economics but of other 
branches of knowledge. Another group admitted that the treatment 
of these "noneconomic" motives and their influence on the formation 
of prices was a task of economics also, but they believed that it must 
be left to later generations. It will be shown at a later stage of our in- 
vestigations that this distinction between "economic" and "noneco- 
nomic" motives of human action is untcnabIe." At this point it is 
only important to realize that this doctrine of the "economic" side 
of human action utterly misrepresents the teachings of the'classical 
economists. They never intended to do what this doctrine ascribes 
co hem. Tney wanted to conceive the reai formarion of prices-not 
fictitious prices as they would be determined if men were acting under 
the sway of hypothetical conditions different from those really in- 
fluencing them. The prices they try to explain and do explain-al- 
though without tracing them back to the choices of the consumers 
-are real market prices. The demand and supply of which they 
speak are real factors determined by all motives instigating men to 
buy or to sell. What was wrong with their theory was that they did 
not trace demand back to the choices of the consumers; they licked 


Human Action 

a satisfactory theory of demand. But it was not their idea that de- 
mand as they used this concept in their dissertations was exclusively 
determined by "economic" motives as distinguished from "noneco- 
nomic" motives. As they restricted their theorizing to the actions of 
businessmen, they did not deal with the motives of the ultimate con- 
sumers. Nonetheless their theory of prices was intended as an explana- 
tion of real prices irrespective of the motives and ideas instigating 
the consumers. 

Modern subjective economics starts with the solution of the ap-
parent paradox of value. It neither limits its theorems to the actions 
of businessmen alone nor deals with a fictitious homo oeconomicus. 
It treats the inexorable categories of everybody's action. Its theorems 
concerning commodity prices, wage rates, and interest rates refer to 
all these phenomena without any regard to the motives causing 
people to buy or to sell or to abstain from buying or selling. It is 
time to discard entirely any reference to the abortive attempt to 
justify the shortcomings of older economists through the appeal to 
the homo oeconomicus phantom. 

10. The Procedure of Economics 
The scope of praxeology is the explication of the category of hu- 
man action. All that is needed for the deduction of all praxeological 
theorems is knowledge of the essence of human action. It is a knowl- 
edge that is our own because we are men; no being of human descent 
that pathological conditions have not reduced to a merely vegetative 
existence lacks it. No special experience is needed in order to compre- 
hend these theorems, and no experience. however rich, could disclose 
them to a being who did not know a priori what human action is. The 
only way to a cognition of these theorems is logical analysis of our 
inhereni knowledge of the category of action. We must bethink 
ourselves and reflect upon the structure of human action. Like logic 
and mathematics, praxeoiogicai itnowicdgc is in us; it does not come 
from without. 

All the concepts and theorems of praxeology are implied in the 
category of human action. The first task is to extract and to deduce 
them, t; expound their implications and to define the universal condi- 
tions of acting as such. Having shown what conditions are required 
by any action, one must go further and define-of course, in a 
categorial and formal sense-the less general conditions required for 
special modes of acting. It would be possible to deal with this second 


Epistenzological Problems of Human Action 

task by delineating all thinkable conditions and deducing from them 
all inferences logically permissible. Such an ail-comprehensive system 
would provide a theory referring not only to human action as it is 
under the conditions and circumstances given in the real world in 
which man lives and acts. It wouId deal no less with hypothetical 
acting such as would take place under the unrealizable conditions of 
imaginary worlds. 

But the end of science is to know reality. It is not mental gymnastics 
or a logical pastime. Therefore praxeology restricts its inquiries to the 
study of acting under those conditions and presuppositions which 
are given in reality. It studies acting under unrealized and unrcaliz- 
able conditions only from two points of view. It deals with states of 
affairs which, although not real in the present and past world, could 
possibly become real at some future date. And it examines unreal 
and unrealizable conditions if such an inquiry is needed for a satisfac- 
tory grasp of what is going on under the conditions present in reality. 

However, this reference to experience does not impair the aprioristic 
character of praxeology and economics. Experience merely directs 
our curiosity toward certain problems and diverts it from other 
problems. It tells us what we should explore, but it does not tell us how 
we could proceed in our search for knowledge. Moreover, it is not 
experience but thinking alone which teaches us that, and in what 
instances, it is necessary to investigate unrealizable hypothetical con- 
ditions in order to conceive what is going on in the real world. 

The disutility of labor is not of a categorial and aprioristic char- 
acter. We can without contradiction think of a world in which labor 
does not cause uneasiness, and we can depict the state of affairs pre- 
vailing in such a world.23 But the real world is conditioned by the 
disutility of labor. Only theorems based on the assumption that 
labor is a source of uneasiness are applicable for the comprehension 
of what is going on in this world. 

Experience teaches that there is disutility of labor. But it does not 
teach it dlrectiy. There is no phenomenon that introduces itseif as 
disutility of labor. There are only data of experience which are inter- 
preted, on the ground of aprioristic knowledge, to mean that men 
consider leisure-i.e., the absence of labor-other things bcing equal, 
as a more desirable condition than the expenditure of labor. We see 
that men renounce advantages which they could get by working 
more-that is, that they arc ready to make sacrifices for the attain- 
ment of leisure. We infer from this fact that leisure is valued as a good 

23. See below, pp. 131-133. 

Human Action 

and that labor is regarded as a burden. But for previous praxeological 
insight, we would never be in a position to reach this conclusion. 

A theory of indirect exchange and all further theories built upon 
it-as the theory of circulation credit-are applicable only to the 
interpretation of events within a world in which indirect exchange 
is practiced. In a world of barter trade only it would be mere in- 
tellectual play. It is unlikely that the economists of such a world, if 
economic science could have emerged at all in it, would have given 
any thought to the problems of indirect exchange, money, and all 
the rest. In our actual world, however, it is an essential part of eco- 
nomic theory. 

The fact that praxcology, in fixing its eye on the comprehension 
of reality, concentrates upon the investigation of those problems 
which are useful for this purpose, does not alter the aprioristic char- 
acter of its reasoning. But it marks the way in which economics, up 
to now the only elaborated part of praxeology, presents the results 
of its endeavors. 

Economics does not follow the procedure of logic and mathematics. 
It does not present an integrated system of pure aprioristic ratiocina- 
tion severed from any reference to reality. In introducing assump- 
tions into its reasoning, it satisfies itself that the treatment of the 
assumptions concerned can render useful services for the compre- 
hension of reality. It does not strictly separate in its treatises and mono- 
graphs pure science from the application of its theorems to the solu- 
tion of concrete historical and political problems. It adopts for the 
organized presentation of its results a form in which aprioristic theory 
and the interpretation of l~istorical phenomena are intertwined. 

It is obvious that this mode of procedure is enjoined upon eco- 
nomics by the very nature and essence of its subject matter. It has 
given proof of its expediency. However, one must not overlook the 
fact that the manipulation of this singular and logically somewhat 
strange procedure requires caution and subtlety, and that uncritical 
and superficial minds have again and again been led astray by care-
less confusion of the two epistemologically different methods im- 
plied. 

There are no such things as a historical method of economics or 
a discipline of institutional economics. There is economics and there 
is economic history. The two must never bc confused. All theorems 
of economics are necessarily valid in every instance in which all the 
assumptions presupposed are given. Of course, they have no practical 
significance in situations where these conditions are not established. 
The theorems referring to indirect exchange are not applicable to 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 

conditions where there is no indirect exchange. But this does not im- 
pair their validity.24 

The issue has been obfuscated by the endeavors of governments 
and powerful pressure groups to disparage economics and to defame 
the economists. Princes and democratic majorities are drunk with 
power. They must reluctantly admit that they are subject to the 
laws of nature. But they reject the very notion of economic law. Are 
they not the supreme legislators? Don't they have the power to crush 
every opponent? hTo war lord is prone to acknowledge any limits 
other than those imposed on him by a superior armed force: Servile 
scribblers are always ready to foster such complacency by expound- 
ing the appropriate doctrines. They call their garbled presumptions 
"historical economics." In fact, economic history is a long record of 
government policies that failed because they were designcd with a 
bold disregard for the laws of economics. 

It is impossible to understand the history of economic thought if 
one does not pay attention to the fact that economics as such is a 
challenge to the conceit of those in power. An economist can never 
be a favorite of autocrats and demagogues. With them he is always 
the mischief-maker, and the more they are inwardly convinced that 
his objections are well founded, the more they hate him. 

In the face of all this frenzied agitation it is expedient to establish 
the fact that the starting point of all praxeological and economic 
reasoning, the category of human action, is proof against any criticisms 
and objections. No appeal to any historical or empirical considerations 
whatever can discover any fault in the proposition that men pur- 
posefully aim at certain chosen ends. No talk about irrationaIity, the 
unfathomable depths of the human soul, the spontaneity of the 
phenomena of life, automatisms, reflexes, and tropisms, can invali- 
date the statement that man makes use of his reason for the realiza- 
tion of wishes and desires. From the unshakable foundation of the 
category of human action praxeology and economics proceed step 
by step by means of discursive reasoning. Precisely defining assump- 
tions and conditions, they construct a system of concepts and draw 
all the inferences implied by logically unassailabIe ratiocination. With 
regard to the results thus obtained only two attitudes are possible: 
either one can unmask logical errors in the chain of the deductions 
which produced these results, or one must acknowledge their cor- 
rectness and validity. 

It is vain to object that life and reality arc not logical. Life and 

24. Cf. F. H. Knight, The Ethics of Competition and Other Essays (New 
Yo& 1935)-P-'39. 

68 Human Action 

reality are neither logical nor illogical; they are simply given. But 
logic is the only tool available to man for the comprehension of both. 
It is vain to objcct that life and history are inscrutable and ineffable 
and that human reason can never penetrate to their inner core. The 
critics contradict thcmselves in uttering words about the ineffable and 
expounding theories-of course, spurious theories-about the nnfath- 
omable. There are many things beyond the reach of the human mind. 
Rut as far as man is able to attain any knowledge, howevcr limited, he 
can use only one avenue of approach, that opened by reason. 

No less illusory are the endeavors to play off understanding against 
thc theorems of economics. The domain of historical understanding 
is exclusivcly the elucidation of those problems which cannot be 
entircly elucidated by the nonhistorical sciences. Understanding must 
ncver contradict the theories developed by the nonhistorical sciences. 
Understanding can never do anything but, on the one hand, establish 
the fact that pcople were motitrated by certain ideas, aimed at cer- 
tain ends, and applied certain means for the attainment of these ends, 
and, on the other hand, assign to the various historical factors their 
relevance so far as this cannot be achieved by the nonhistorical sci- 
cnccs. Understanding does not entitle the modern historian to assert 
that exorcism ever was an appropriate means to cure sick cows. 
Neither does it permit him to maintain that an cconomic law was 
not valid in ancient Rome or in the crnpire of the Incas. 

Man is not infallible. He searches for truth-that is, for the most 
adequate comprchcnsion of realitv as far as the structure of his mind 
and reason makes it accessible to him. Man can never become omnis- 
cient. He can never be absolutcly certain that his inquiries were not 
rnislcd and that what he considers as certain truth is not error. All 
that man can do is submit all his theories again and again to the most 
critical reexamination. This means for the economist to trace back 
all theorems to their unquestionable and certain ultimate basis, the 
category of human action, and to test by the most careful scrutiny

under examination. It cannot be contended that this procedure is 
a guarantee against error. But it is undoubtedly the most effective 
method of avoiding error. 

Praxeologp-and conseqnentlv economics too-is a deductive svs- 
tern. Tt draws its strength from the starting point of its deductions. 
from the category of action. No economic theorem can be considered 
sound that is not solidly fastened upon this foundation by an irrcfuta- 
t~le chain of rcasoning. A statement proclaimed without such a con- 
nection is arbitrary and floats in midair. It is impossible to deal with 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 


a special segment of economics if one does not encase it in a complete 
system of action. 

The empirical sciences start from singular events and proceed from 
the unique and individual to the more universal. Their treatment is 
subject to specialization. They can deal with segments without pay- 
ing attention to the whole field. The economist must never be a 
specialist. Zn dealing with any probiem he must always fix his glance 
upon the whole system. 

Historians often sin in this respect. They are ready to invent 
theorems ad hoc. They sometimes fail to recognize that it is impossible 
to abstract any causal relations from the study of complex phenomena. 
Their pretension to investigate reality without any reference to what 
they disparage as preconceived ideas is vain. In fact they unwittingly 
apply popular doctrines long since unmasked as fallacious and contra. 
dictory. 

r I. The Limitations on Praxeological Concepts 

The praxeological categories and concepts are devised for the com- 
prehension of human action. They become self-contradictory and 
nonsensical if one tries to apply them in dealing with conditions dif- 
ferent from those of human life. The naive anthropomorphism of 
primitive religions is unpalatable to the philosophic mind. However, 
the endeavors of philosophers to define neatly the attributes of an 
absolute being, free from all the limitations and frailties of human 
existence, by the use of praxeological concepts, are no less question- 
able. 

Scholastic philosophers and theologians and likewise Theists and 
Deists of the Age of Reason conceived an absolute and perfect being, 
unchangeable, omnipotent, and omniscient, and yet planning and 
acting, aiming at ends and employing means for the attainment of 
these ends. But action can only be imputed to a discontented being, 
and repeated action only to a being who lacks the power to remove 
his uneasiness once and for all at one stroke. An acting being is dis- 
contented and therefore not almighty. If he were contented, he would 
not act, and if he were almighty, he would have long since radically 
removed his discontent. For an all-powerful being there is no pressure 
to choose between various states of uneasiness; he is not under the 
necessity of acquiescing in the lesser evil. Omnipotence would mean 
the power to achieve everything and to enjoy full satisfaction with- 
out being restrained by any limitations. But this is incompatible with 
the very concept of action. For an almighty being the categories of 


ends and means do not exist. He is above all human comprehension, 
concepts, and understanding. For the almighty being every "means" 
renders unlimited services, he can apply every "means" for the at- 
tainment of any ends, he can achieve every end without the employ- 
ment of any means. It is beyond the faculties of the human mind 
to think the concept of almightiness consistently to its ultimate logical 
consequences. The paradoxes are insoluble. Has the almighty being 
the power to achieve something which is immune to his later inter- 
ference? If he has this power, then there are limits to his might and 
he is no longer almighty; if he lacks this power, he is by virtue of this 
fact alone not almighty. 

Are omnipotence and omniscience compatible? Omniscience pre- 
supposes that all future happenings are already unalterably deter- 
mined. If there is omniscience, omnipotence is inconceivable. Impo- 
tence to change anything in the predetermined course of events would 
restrict the power of any agent. 

Action is a display of potency and control that are limited. It is 
a manifestation of man who is restrained by the circumscribed powers 
of his mind, the physiological nature of his body, the vicissitudes of 
his environment, and the scarcity of the external factors on which his 
welfare depends. It is vain to refer to the imperfections and weak- 
nesses of human life if one aims at depicting something absolutely 
perfect. The very idea of absolute perfection is in every way self- 
contradictory. The state of absolute perfection must be conceived 
as complete, final, and not exposed to any change. Change could 
only impair its perfection and transform it into a less perfect state; the 
mere possibility that a change can occur is incompatible with the 
concept of absolute perfection. But the absence of change-ix., per-
fect immutability, rigidity and immobility-is tantamount to the ab- 
sence of life. Life and perfection are incompatible, but so are death 
and perfection. 

The living is not perfect because it is liable to change; the dead is 
not perfect because it does not live. 

The language of living and acting men can form comparatives and 
superlatives in comparing degrees. But absoluteness is not a degree; 
it is a limiting notion. The absolute is indeterminable, unthinkable and 
ineffable. It is a chimerical conception. There are no such things as 
perfect happiness, perfect men, eternal bliss. Every attempt to describe 
the conditions of a land of Cockaigne, or the life of the Angels, re- 
sults in paradoxes. Where there are conditions, therc are limitations 
and not perfection; there are endeavors to conquer obstacles, there 
are frustration and discontent. 


Epistemological Problems of Human Action 

After the philosophers had abandoned the search for the absolute, 
the utopians took it up. They weave dreams about the perfect state. 
They do not realize that the state, the social apparatus of compulsion 
and coercion, is an institution to cope with human imperfection and 
that its essential function is to inflict punishment upon minorities in 
order to protect majorities against the detrimental consequences of 
certain actions. With "perfect" men there would not he any need for 
compulsion and coercion. But utopians do not pay heed to human 
nature and the inalterable conditions of human life. Godwin thought 
that man might become immortal after the abolition of private 
property." Charles Fourier babbled about the ocean containing 
lemonade instead of salt water.20 Marx's economic system blithely 
ignored the fact of the scarcity of material factors of production. 
Trotsky revealed that in the proletarian paradise "the average human 
type will rise to the heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe, or a Marx. And 
above this ridge new peaks will rise."

Nowadays the most popular chimeras are stabilization and security.

111. ECONOMICS AxD THE REVOLT AGAINST REASON 
I. The Revolt Against Reason 
IT is true that some philosophers were ready to overrate the power 

of human reason. They believed that man can discover by ratio- 
cination the final causes of cosmic events, the inherent ends the prirne 
mover aims at in creating the universe and determining the course of 
its evolution. 'They expatiated on the "Absolute" as if it were their 
pocket watch. They did not shrink from announcing eternal abso- 
lute values and from establishing moral codes unconditionally binding 
on all men. 

Then there was the long line of utopian authors. They drafted 
schemes for an earthly paradise in which pure reason alone should 
rule. They failed to realize that what they called absolute reason 
and manifest truth was the fancy of their own minds. They blithely 
arrogated to themselves infalIibility and often advocated intolerance, 
the violent oppression of all dissenters and heretics. 'They aimed at 
dictatorship either for themselves or for men who would accurately 
put their plans into execution. There was, in their opinion, no other 
salvation for suffering mankind. 

There was Hegel. He was a profound thinker and his writings are a 
treasury of stimulating ideas. But he was laboring under the delusion 
that Geist,the Absolute, revealed itself through his words. There was 
nothing in the universe that was hidden to Hegel. It was a pity- that 
his language was so ambiguous that it could be interpreted in various 
ways. The right-wing Hegelians interpreted it as an endorsement 
of the l'russian system of autocratic government and of the dog- 
mas of the Prussian Church. The left-wing Hegelians read out of it 
atheism, intransigent revolutionary radicalism, and anarchistic doc- 
trines. 

There was Auguste Comte. He knew precisely what the future had 
in store for mankind. And, of course, he considered himself as the 
supreme legislator. For example, he regarded astronomical studies as 
useless and wanted to prohibit them. He planned to substitute a new 
religion for Christianity, and selected a lady who in this new church 
was destined to replace the Virgin. Comte can be exculpated, as he 


Economics and the Revolt Against Reason

was insane in the full sense which pathology attaches to this term. But 
what about his followers? 

Many more facts of this kind could be mentioned. But they are 
no argument against reason, rationalism, and rationaIity. These dreams 
have nothing at all to do with the question of whether or not reason 
is the right and only instrument available for man in his endeavors to 
attain as much knowledge as is accessible to him. The honest and 
conscicntious truth-seekcrs have never pretended that reason and 
scientific research can answer all questions. Thev were fully aware 
of the limitations imposed upon the human miid. They cannot be 
taxed with responsibility for the crudities of the philosophy of 
Haeckel and the simplism of the various materialist schools. 

The rationalist philosophers themselves were always intent upon 
showing the boundaries both of aprioristic theory and of empirical 
rcscarc11.l The first representative of British political economy, David 
Hume, the Utilitarians, and the American Pragmatists are certainly 
not guilty of having exaggerated the power of man to attain truth. It 
would be more justifiable to blame the philosophy of the last two 
hundred years for too much agnosticism and skeptickm than for over- 
confidence in what could be achicved by the human mind. 

The revolt against reason, the characteristic mental attitude of our 
age, was not caused by a lack of modesty, caution, and sclf-examina- 
tion on the part of the philosophers. Neither was it due to failures in 
the evolution of modern naturaI science. The amazing achievements 
of technology and therapeutics speak a language which nobody can 
ignore. It is hopeless to attack modern science, whether from the 
angle of intuitionism and mysticism, or from any other point of view. 
The revolt against reason ;as directed against another target. It did 
not aim at the natural sciences, but at economics. The attack against 
the natural sciences was only the logically necessary outcome of the 
attack against economics. It was impermissible to dethrone reason in 
one field only and not to question it in other branches of knowledge 
also. 

The great upheaval was born out of the historical situation existing 
in the middle of the nineteenth century. The economists had entirely 
demolished the fantastic delusions of the socialist utopians. The de- 
ficiencies of the classical system prevented them from comprehending 
why every socialist plan must be unrealizable; but they knew enough 
to demonstrate the futility of all socialist schemes produced up to their 
time. The communist ideas were done for. The socialists were abso- 

I. Cf., for instance, Louis Rougier, Les Paralogismes du rationalisme (Paris, 
1920). 


Hurwzlrn Action 

lutely unable to raise any objection to the devastating criticism of 
their schcmes and to advance any argument in their favor. It seemed 
as if socialism was dead forever. 

Only onc way could lead the socialists out of this impasse. They 
could attack logic and reason and substitute mystical intuition for 
ratiocination. It was the historical role of Karl Marx to propose this 
solution. Based on Hegcl's dialectic mysticism he blithely arrogated 
to hirnsclf thc ability to predict the futurc. Hegel pretended to know 
that Geist, in creating the universe, wanted to bring about the Prus- 
sian monarchy of Frederick William 111. But Marx was better in- 
formed about Geist's plans. He knew that the final cause of historical 
evolution was the establishment of the socialist millennium. Socialism 
is bound to comc "with thc inexorability of a law of nature." And as, 
according to Hegel, every later stage of history is a higher and better 
stage, there cannot be any doubt that socialism, the final and ultimate 
stage of mankind's evolution, will be perfect from any point of view. 
It is consequently useless to discuss the details of the operation of a 
socialist commonwealth. History, in due time, will arrange everything 
for the best. It does not need the advice of mortal men. 

There was still the main obstacle to overcome: the devastating 
criticism of the economists. Marx had a solution at hand. Human rea- 
son, he assertcd, is constitutionally unfitted to find truth. The logical 
structure of mind is different with various social classes. There is no 
such thing as a universally valid logic. What mind produces can 
never be anything but "ideology," that is in the Marxian terminology, 
a set of ideas disguising the selfish interests of the thinlter's own social 
class. Hence, the "bourgeois" mind of the economists is utterly inca- 
pable of producing more than an apology for capitalism. The teach- 
ings of "bourgeois" science, an offshoot of "bourgeois" logic, are of 
no avail for the proletarians, the rising class destined to abolish all 
classes and to convert the earth into a Garden of Eden. 

Bur, of course, thc logic of the proletarians is not merely a class 
logic. '*Theidcas of pro!e;ariaii logic are iiot priji ideas, but eman.a-

D 

tions of logic pure and simple." Moreover, by virtue of a special 
privilegc, the logic of certain elect bourgeois is not tainted with the 
original sin of being bourgeois. Karl Marx, the son of a well-to-do 
lawyer, married to the daughter of a Prussian Junker, and his collabo- 
rator Frederick Engels, a wealthy textile manufacturer, never doubted 
that they themselves were above the law and, notwithstanding their

Logik (zd ed. Stuttgart, rgoj), p. I I 2. 

Economics and the Revolt Against Reason 

bourgeois background, were endowed with the power to discover 
absolute truth. 

It is the task of history to describe the historical conditions which 
made such a crude doctrine popular. Economics has another task. 
It must analyze both Marxian polylogism and the other brands of 
polylogism formed after its pattern, and expose their fallacies and 
contradictions. 

2. The Logical Aspect: of Polylogism 
Marxian polylogism asserts that the logical structure of mind is 
different with {he members of various social classes. Racial polylogism 
differs from Marxian polylogism only in so far as it ascribes to each 
race a peculiar IogicaI structure of mind and n~aintains that all 
members of a definite race, no matter what their class affiliation may 
be, are endowed with this peculiar logical structure. 

There is no need to enter here into a critique of the concepts social 
class and race as applied by these doctrines. It is not necessary to ask 
the @~xians when and how a proletarian who succeeds in joining 
the ranks of the bourgeoisie changes his proIetarian mind into a bour- 
geois mind. It is superfluous to ask the racists to explain what kind 
of logic is peculiar to people who are not of pure racial stock. There 
are much more serious objections to be raised. 

Neither the Marxians nor the racists nor the supporters of any 

other brand of polyloaism ever went further than to declare that the 

4

logical structure of mmd is different with various classes, races, or 
nations. They never ventured to demonstrate precisely in what the 
logic of the proletarians differs from the logic of the bourgeois, or in 
what the logic of the Aryans differs from the logic of the non-Aryans, 
or the logic of the Germans from the logic of the French or the British. 
In the eyes of the Marxians the Ricardian theory of comparative cost 
is spurious because Ricardo was a bourgeois. The German racists 
condemn the same theory because Ricardo was a Jew, and the Ger- 
man nationalists because he was an Englishman. Some German pro- 
fessors advanced all these three arguments together against the validity 
of Ricardo's teachings. How-ever, it is not enough to reject a theory 
whoIesaIe by unmasking the background of its author. What is wanted 
is first to expound a system of logic different from that applied by the 
criticized author. Then it would be necessary to examine the con- 
tested theory point by point and to show where in its reasoning in- 
ferences are made which-although correct from the point of view of 


76 Human Action 

its author's logic-are invalid from the point of view of the prole- 
tarian, Aryan, or German logic. And finally, it should be explained 
what kind of conclusions the replacement of the author's vicious in- 
ferences by the correct inferences of the critic's own logic must lead 
to. As everybody knows, this never has been and never can be at- 
tempted by anybody. 

Then there is the fact that there is disagreement concerning es- 
sential problems among people belonging to the same class, race, or 
nation. Unfortunately there are, say the Nazis, Germans who do not 
think in a correct German way. But if a German does not always 
necessarily think as he should, but may think in the manner of a man 
equipped with a non-German logic, who is to dccidc which German's 
ideas are truly German and which un-German? Says the late Pro- 
fessor Franz Oppcnheimer: "The individual errs often in looking 
after his interests; a class never errs in the long run." This would 
suggest the infallibility of a majority vote. However, the Nazis 
rejected decision by majority vote as manifestly un-German. The 
Marxians pay lip service to the democratic principle of majority vote.4 
But whenever it comes to a test they favor minority rule, provided 
it is the rule of their own party. Let us remember how Lenin dis- 
persed by force the Constituent AssembIy elected, under the auspices 
of his own government. by universal franchise for men and women, 
because only about one-fifth of its members wcre Bolshevik. 

A consistent supporter of polylogism would have to maintain that 
ideas are correct because their author is a member of the right class, 
nation, or race. But consistency is not one of their virtues. Thus the 
Marxians are prepared to assib the epithet "prolctarian thinker" to 
everybody whose doctrines they approve. All the others they dis- 
parage eiiher as foes of their class or as social traitors. Hitlcr was 
even frank enough to admit that the only method available for him 
to sift the true Germans from the mongrels and the aliens was to 
enunciate a genuinely German program and to sec who wcre ready

might be. No further proof is needed of the insincerity of the whole 
doctrine. 

3. The Praxeological Aspect of Polylogism 
An ideology in the Marxian sense of this term is a doctrine which, 
although erroneous from the point of view of the correct logic 
of the proletarians, is beneficial to the selfish interests of the class which 
has developed it. An ideology is objectivel~ vicious, but it furthers 
the interests of the thinker's class precisely bn account of its vicious- 
ness. Many Marxians believe that they have proved this tenet by 
stressing the point that people do not thirst for knowledge only for 
its own sake. The aim of the scientist is to pave the way for success- 
ful action. Theories are always developed with a view to practical 
application. There are no such things as pure science and the disinter- 
ested search for truth. 

For the sake of argument we may admit that every effort to attain 
truth is motivated by considerations of its practical utilization for 
the attainment of some end. But this does not answer the question 
why an "ideological"-i.e., a false-theory should render better serv- 
ice than a correct one. The fact that the practical application of a 
theory results in the outcome predicted on the basis of this theory 
is universally considered a confirmation of its correctness. It is para- 
doxical to assert that a vicious theory is from any point of view more 
usefuI than a correct one. 

Men use firearms. In order to improve these weapons they devel- 
oped the science of ballistics. But, of course, precisely because they 
were eager to hunt game and to kill one another, a correct ballistics. A 
merely "ideologica1" ballistics would not have been of any use. 

For the Marxians the view that scientists labor for ltnowledge alone 

is nothing but an "arrogant pretense" of the scientists. Thus they 

declare that Maxwell was led to his theory of electromagnetic waves

stigated not only by the desire to fight contagious diseases, but also 
by the desire of the producers of wine and of cheese to improve 
their methods of production. But the result obtained was certainly 
not "ideological" in the Marxian sense. 

What induced hlarx to invent his ideology-doctrine was the wish 
to sap the prestige of economics. He was fully aware of his impotence 
to refute the objections raised by the economists to the practicability 
of the socialist schemes. In fact he was so fascinated by the theoretical 
system of British classical economics that he firmly believed in its 
impregnability. He either never learned about the doubts that the 
classical theory of value raised in the minds of judicious scholars, or, 
if he ever heard of them, he did not comprehend their weight. His 
own economic ideas are hardly more than a garbled version of 
Ricardianism. When Jevons and Menger inaugurated a new era of 
economic thought, his career as an author of economic writings had 
already come to an end; the first volume of 13as Kapital had already 
been published several years previously. Marx's only reaction to the 
marginal theory of value was that he postponed the publication of the 
later volumes of his main treatise. They were made accessible to the 
public only after his death. 

In developing the ideology-doctrine Adarx exclusively aims at eco- 
nomics and the social philosophy of Ctilitarianism. His only inten- 
tion was to destroy the reputation of economic teachings which he 
was unable to refute by means of logic and ratiocination. He gave to 
his doctrine the form of a universal law valid for the whole historical 
age of social classes because a statement which is applicable only to 
one individual historical event could not be considered as a law. For 
the same reasons he did not restrict its validity to economic thought 
only, but included every branch of knowledge. 

The service which bourgeois economics rendered to the bour- 
geoisie was in Marx's eyes twofold. It aided then1 first in their fight 
against feudalism and royal despotism and then later again in their 
fight against the rising proletarian class. It provided a rational and 
moral justification for capitalist exploitation. It was, if we want to use 
a notion developed after Marx's death, a rationalization of the claims 
of the capitalist^.^ The capitalists, in their subconsciousness ashamed 
of the mean greed motivating their own conduct and anxious to 
avoid social disapproval, encouraged their sycophants, the economists, 

8. Although the term rationalization is new, the thing itself was known long 
ago. Cf., for instance, the words of Benjamin Franklin: "So convenient a thing 
it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for 
every thing one has a mind to do." (Autobiography,ed. New York, 1944,P. 41.) 

Economics and the Revolt Against Reason 

to proclaim doctrines which could rehabilitate them in public 
opinion. 

Now, recourse to the notion of rationalization provides a psycho- 
logical description of the incentives which impelled a man or a group 
of men to formulate a theorem or a whole theory. But it does not pred- 
icate anything about the validity or invalidity of the theory ad- 
vanced. If it is proved that the theory concerned is untenable, the 
notion of rationalization is a psychological interpretation of the 
causes which made their authors liable to error. But if we are not in a 
position to find any fault in the theory advanced, no appeal to the 
concept of rationalization can possibly explode its validity. If it were 
true that the economists had in their subconsciousness no design 
other than that of justifying the unfair claims of the capitalists, their 
theories could nevertheless be quite correct. There is no means to ex- 
pose a faulty theory other than to refute it by discursive reasoning and 
to substitute a better theory for it. In dealing with the theorem of 
Pythagoras or with the theory of comparative costs, we are not in- 
terested in the psychoIogica1 factors that impelled Pythagoras and 
Ricardo to construct these theorems, although these things may be 
important for the historian and the biographer. For science the only 
relevant question is whether or not these theorems can stand the test 
of rational examination. The social or racial background of their 
authors is beside the point. 

It is a fact that people in the pursuit of their selfish interests try to 
use doctrines more or less universally accepted by public opinion. 
Moreover, they are eager to invent and to propagate doctrines which 
they could possibly use for furthering their own interests. But this 
does not explain why such doctrines, favoring the interests of a 
minority and contrary to the interests of the rest of the people, are 
endorsed hy public opinion. No matter whether such "ideological" 
doctrines are the product of a "false consciousness," forcing a man 
to think unwittingly in a manner that serves the interests of his class, 
or whether they are the product of a purposeful distortion of truth, 
they must encounter the ideologies of other classes and try to sup- 
plant them. Then a rivalry between antagonistic ideologies emerges. 
The Marxians explain victory and defeat in such conflicts as an out- 
come of the interference of historical providence. Geist, the mythical 
prime mover, operates according to a definite plan. He leads man- 
kind through various preliminary stages to the final bliss of socialisnl. 
Every stage is the product of a certain state of technology; a11 its other 
characteristics are the necessary ideological superstructure of this 
technological state. .Geist causes man to bring about in due time 


Human Action 

the technological ideas adequate to the stage in which he lives, and to 
realize them. All the rest is an outgrowth of the state of technology. 
The hand-mill made feudal society; the steam-mill made capitalis~n.~ 
Human will and reason play only an ancillary role in these changes. 
The inexorable law of historical development forces men-independ- 
ently of their wills-to think and to behave according to the patterns 
corresponding to the material basis of their age. Men fool themselves 
in bclicving that they are free to choose benveen various ideas and 
between what they call truth and error. They themselves do not 
think; it is historical providence that manifests itself in their thoughts. 

'l'his is a purely mystical doctrine. The only proof given in its sup- 
port is the recourse to Hegelian dialectics. Capitalist private property 
is the first negation of individual private property. It begets, with the 
inexorability of a law of nature, its own negation, namely common 
ownership of the means of production.10 However, a mystical doc- 
trine based on intuition does not lose its mysticism by referring to 
another no less mystical doctrine. This makeshift by no means an- 
swers the question why a thinker must necessarily deveIop an ideology 
in accordance with the interests of his class. For thc sake of argument 
we may admit that man's thoughts must result in doctrines beneficial 
to his interests. But are a rnan's interests necessarily identical with those 
of his whole class? Marx himself had to admit that the organization 
of the proletarians into a class, and consequently into a political 
party, is continually being upset again by the competition between 
the workers themselves.ll It is an undeniable fact that there prevails 
an irreconcilable conflict of interests between those workers who are 
cmployed at union wage rates and those who remain unemployed 
because the enforcement of union rates prevents the demand for and 
the supply of labor from finding the appropriate price for meeting. 
It is no less true that the interests of the workers of the comparatively 
overpopulated countries and those of the comparatively underpopu- 
lated countries are antagonistic with regard to migration barriers. 

The statement that the interests of a!! prG!etar-ar,s unifGrm!x~

thc substitution of socialism for capitalism is an arbitrary postulate 
of Marx and the other socia!ists. It cannot be proved by the mere as-

and thcrcfore certainly beneficial to the interests of the proletariat as 
such.

Econonzics and the Revolt Against Reason 8 I 

A popular interpretation of the vicissitudes of British foreign trade 
policies, based on the ideas of Sismondi, Frederick List, Man, and 
the German Historical School, runs this way: In the second part 
of the eighteenth century and in the greater part of the nineteenth 
century the class interests of the British bourgeoisie required a free 
trade policy. Therefore British political economy elaborated a free 
trade doctrine, and the British manufacturers oiganined a popular 
movement which finally succeeded in abolishing protective tariffs. 
Then later conditions changed. The British bourgeoisie could no 
longer stand the competition of foreign manufacturing and badly 
needed protective tariffs. Consequently the economists substituted 
a theory of protection for the antiquated free trade ideology, and 
Great Britain returned to protectionism. 

The first error in this interpretation is that it considers the "bour- 
geoisie'' as a homogeneous class composed of mcrnbcrs whose inter- 
ests are identical. A businessman is always under the necessity of ad- 
justing the conduct of his business to the institutional conditions of 
his country. In the long run he is, in his capacity as entrepreneur and 
capitalist, neither favored nor injured by tariffs or the absence of 
tariffs. He will turn to the production of those commodities which 
under the given state of affairs he can most profitably produce. What 
may hurt or further his short-run interests are only changes in the 
institutional setting. But such changes do not affect the various 
branches of business and the various enterpriscs in the same way and 
to the same extent. A measure that benefits one branch or enterprise 
may be detrimental to other branches or entcrprises. What counts 
for a businessman is only a limited number of customs items. And 
with regard to these items the interests of various branches and firms 
arc mostly antagonistic. 

It is not true that in the years of the supremacy of free trade ideas 
the interests of all branches of British manufacturing were homogene- 
ous and could be uniformly favored by the abandonment of protec-

competition innocuous for them. Today the American pIants enjoy 
a similar superiority. Nevertheless a great part of American manu- 
facturing believes that they badly need protection against the back- 
ward industries of other countries. 

The interests of every branch or firm can be favored by 311 kinds 
of granted to it by the government. But if privileges are 
granted to the same extent to the other branches and firms, every 
businessman loses-not only in his capacity as consumer, but also in 


Human Action 

his capacity as buyer of raw materials, half-finished products, ma- 
chines and other equipment-on the one hand as much as he profits 
on the other. Selfish group interests may impel a man to ask for 
protection for his own branch or firm. They can never motivate him 
to ask for universal protection for all branches or firms if he is not 
sure to be protected to a greater extent than the other industries or 
enterprises. 

Neither were the British manufacturers from the point of view of 
their class concerns more interested in the abolition of the Corn Laws 
than other British citizens. The landowners were opposed to the repeal 
of these laws because a lowering of the prices for agricultural 
products reduced the rent of land. A special class interest of the 
manufacturers can only be construed on the basis of the long since 
discarded iron law of wages and the no less untenable doctrine that 
profits are an outcome of the exploitation of the workers. 

Within a world organized on the basis of the division of labor, 
every change must in one way or another effect the short-run inter- 
ests of many groups. It is therefore always easy to expose every 
doctrine supporting an alteration of existing conditions as an "ideo- 
logical" disguise of the selfish interests of a special group of people. 
The main occupation of many present-day authors is such unmask- 
ing. Marx did not invent this procedure. It was known long before 
him. Its most curious manifestation was the attempts of some eight- 
eenth-century writers to explain religious creeds as a fraudulent de- 
ception on the part of the priests eager to gain power and wealth both 
for themselves and for their allies, the exploiters. The Marxians en- 
dorsed this statement in labeling religion "opium for the masses." l2 
It never occurred to the supporters of such teachings that where 
there are selfish interests pro there must necessarily be selfish inter- 
ests contra too. It is by no means a satisfactory explanation of any 
event that it favored a special class. The question to be answered is 
why the rest of the population whose interests it injured did not 

succeed ir?

Every firm and every branch of business is in the short run inter- 
ested in increased sales of its products. In the long run, however, 
there prevails a tendency toward an equalization of returns in the 
various branches of production. If demand for the products of a 
branch increases and raises profits, more capital flows into it and 

12. The meaning that contemporary Marxism attaches to this phrase, viz., that 
the religious drug has been purposely administered to the people, may have 
been the meaning of Marx too. But it was not implied in the passage in which 
-in 1843-Marx coined this phrase. Cf. R. P. Cascy, Religion in Rassia (New 
York, I 946), pp. 67-69. 

Economics and the Revolt Against Reason 

the competition of the new enterprises cuts down the profits. Profits 
are by no means higher in the sale of socially detrimental articles 
than in the sale of socially beneficial articles. If a certain branch of 
business is outlawed and those engaged in it risk prosecution, pcnalties, 
and imprisonment, gross profits must be high enough to compensate 
for the risks involved. But this does not interfere with the height of 
net returns. 

The rich, the owners of the already operating plants, have no par- 
ticular class interest in the maintenance of free competition. They 
are opposed to confiscation and expropriation of their fortunes, but 
their vested interests are rather in favor of measures preventing new- 
comers from challenging their position. 'Those fighting for free enter- 
prise and free competition do not defend the interests of those rich 
today. They want a free hand left to unknown men who will be the 
entrepreneurs of tomorrow and whose ingenuity will make the life 
of coming generations more agreeable. They want the way left open 
to further economic improvements. They are the spokesmen of 
progress. 

The nineteenth-century success of free trade ideas was effected 
by the theories of classical economics. The prestige of these ideas 
was so great that those whose selfish class interests they hurt could 
not hinder their endorsement by public opinion and their reahation 
by legislative measures. lt is ideas that make history, and not history 
that makes ideas. 

It is useless to argue with mystics and seers. They base their as- 
sertions on intuition and are not prepared to submit them to rational 
examination. The Marxians pretend that what their inner voice pro- 
claims is history's self-revelation. If other people do not hear this 
voicc, it is only a proof that they are not chosen. It is insolence that 
those groping in darkness dare to contradict the inspired ones. De- 
cency should impel them to creep into a corner and keep silent. 

~owever, science cannot abstain from thinking although it is 
obvious that it will never succeed in convincing those who dispute 
the supremacy of reason. Science must emphasize that the appeal to 
intuition cannot settle the question which of several antagonistic 
doctrines is the right one and which are wrong. It is an undeniable fact 
that Marxism is not thc only doctrine advanced in our time. There 
arc other "ideologies" besides Marxism. The hlarxians assert that the 
application of these other doctrines would hurt the interests of the 
many. But the supporters of these doctrines say precisely the same 
with regard to Marxism. 

Of course, the Marxians consider a doctrine vicious if their author's 


Human Action 

background is not proletarian. But who is proletarian? Doctor Marx, 
the manufacturer and "exploiter" Engels, and Lenin, the scion of the 
Russian gentry, were certainly not of proletarian background. But 
I-Iitler and Mussolini were genuine proletarians and spent their youth 
in poverty. The conflict of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks or that 
between Stalin and Trotsky cannot be presented as class conflicts. 
They were conflicts between various sects of fanatics who called 
one another traitors. 

The essence of Marxian philosophy is this: We are right because 
we are the spolrcsmen of the rising proletarian class. Discursive rea- 
soning cannot invalidate our teachings, for they are inspired by the 
supreme pourer that determincs the destiny of mankind. Our adver- 
saries are wrong because they lack the intuition that guides our 
minds. It is, of course, not their fault that on account of their class 
affiliation they are not equipped with the genuine proIetarian logic 
and are blinded by ideologies. The unfathomable decrees of history 
that have elected us have doomed them. The future is ours. 

4. Racial Polylogism 
Marxian polylogism is an abortive makeshift to salvage the un- 
tenable doctrines of socialism. Its attempt to substitute intuition for 
ratiocination appeals to popular superstitions. But it is precisely this 
attitude that places Marxian polylogism and its offshoot, the so- 
called "sociology of Itnowledge," in irreconcilable antagonism to 
science and reason. 

It is different with the polylogism of the racists. This brand of 
polylogism is in agreement with fashionable, although mistaken, tend- 
encies in present-day empiricism. It is an established fact that man- 
kind is divided into various races. The races differ in bodily features. 
Materialist philosophers assert that thoughts are a secretion of the 
brain as bile is a secretion of the gall-bladder. It would be inconsistent 
for them to reject beforehand the hypothesis that the thought-secre- 
tion of the various races may differ in essential qualities. The fact that 
anatomy has not succeeded up to now in discovcring anatomical 
differences in the brain cells of various races cannot invalidate the 
doctrine that the logical structure of mind is different with different 
races. It does not exclude the assumption that later research may dis- 
cover such anatomical peculiarities. 

Some ethnologists tell us that it is a mistake to speak of higher and 

lower civilizations and of an alleged backwardness of alien races. The 


Econonzics and the Revolt Against Reason 

civilization of various races are different from the Western civiliza- 
tion of the peoples of Caucasian stock, but they are not inferior. Every 
race has its peculiar mentality. It is faulty to apply to the civilization 
of any of them yardsticks abstracted from the achievements of 
other races. Westerners call the civilization of China an arrested 
civilization and that of the inhabitants of New Guinea primitive bar- 
barism. But the Chinese and the natives of Kcw Guinea despise our 
civilization no less than we despise theirs. Such estimates are judg- 
ments of value and hence arbitrary. Those other races have a diffcrent 
structure of mind. Their civilizations are adequate to their mind as 
our civilization is adequate to our mind. We are incapable of com- 
prehending that what we call backwardness docs not appcar such 
to them. It is, from the point of view of their logic, a better method 
of coming to a satisfactory arrangement with given natural condi- 
tions of life than is our progressivism. 

These ethnologists are right in emphasizing that it is not the task of 
a historian-and the ethnologist too is a historian-to express value 
judgments. Rut they are utterly mistaken in contending that these 
other races have been guided in their activities by motives other than 
those which have actuated the white race. The Asiatics and the 
Africans no less than the peoples of European descent have been eager 
to struggle successfully for survival and to use reason as the fore- 
most weapon in these endeavors. They have sought to get rid of the 
beasts of prey and of disease, to prevent famines and to raise the 
productivity of labor. There can be no doubt that in the pursuit of 
these aims they have been less successful than the whites. The proof 
is that they aEc eager to profit from all achievements of the West. 
Those ethnologists would be right, if Mongols or Africans, tormentcd 
by a painful disease, were to renounce the aid of a European doctor 
because their mentality or their world view led them to believe 
that it is better to suffer than to be relieved of pain. Mahatma Gandhi 
disavowed his whole philosophy when he cntered a modern hospital 
to be treated for appendicitis. 

The hTorth American Indians lacked the ingenuity to invent the 
wheel. The inhabitants of the AIps were not keen knough to con- 
struct skis which would have rendered their hard life much more 
agreeable. Such shortcomings were not due to a mentality different 
from those of the races which had long since used whecls and skis; 
they were faihres, even when judged from the point of view of the 
Indians and the Alpine mountaineers. 

However, these considerations refer only to the motives determin- 


86 Human Action 

ing concrete actions, not to the only relcvant problem of whether 
or not there exists between various races a difference in the logical 
structure of mind. It is precisely this that the racists assert.13 

We may refer to what has been said in the preceding chapters about 
the fundamentaI issues of the logical structure of mind and the 
categorial principles of thought and action. Some additional observa- 
tions will suffice to give the finishing stroke to racial polylogism and 
to any other brand of polylogism. 

The categories of human thought and action are neither arbitrary 
products of the human mind nor conventions. They are not outside 
of the universe and of the course of cosmic events. They are biological 
facts and have a definite function in life and rcality. They are in- 
struments in man's struggle for existence and in his endeavors to 
adjust himself as much as possible to the real state of the universe and 
to remove uneasiness as much as it is in his power to do so. They are 
therefore appropriate to the structure of thc external world and reflect 
properties of the world and of rcality. They work, and are in this 
sense true and valid. 

It is consequently incorrect to assert that aprioristic insight and 
pure reasoning do not convey any information about reality and the 
structure of the universe. The fundamental logical relations and the 
categories of thought and action are the ultimate source of all human 
knowledge. They are adequate to the structure of reality, they rcveal 
this structure to the human mind and, in this sense, they are for man 
basic ontological facts.14 We do not know what a superhuman in- 
teIlect may think and comprehend. For man every cognition is condi- 
tioned by the logical structure of his mind and ihplied in this struc- 
ture. It is precisely the satisfactory results of the empirical sciences 
and their practical application that evidence this truth. Within the 
orbit in which human action is able to attain ends aimed at there is no 
room left for agnosticism. 

If there had been races which had devdoped a different logical 
stixcyLire of they -would Elave failed in ;he use of reasoil as ail 
aid in the struggle for existence. The only means for survival that 
could have protected them against extermination would have been 
their instinctive reactions. Natural selection would have eliminated 
those specimens of such races that tried to employ their reasoning 
for the direction of behavior. Alone those individuals would have 
survived that rclied upon instincts only. This means that only those

Economics and the Revolt Against Reason 

would have had a chance to survive that did not rise above the mental 
level of animals. 

The scholars of the West have amassed an enormous amount of 
material concerning the high civilizations of China and India and the 
primitive civilizations of the Asiatic, American, Australian, and Afri- 
can aborigines. It is safe to say that all that is worth knowing about 
these races is known. But never has any supporter of polylogism tried 
to use these data for a description of the allegedly different logic of 
these peoples and civilizations. 

5. Polylogism and Understanding 
Some supporters of the tenets of Marxism and racism interpret the 
epistemological teachings of their parties in a peculiar way. They are 
ready to admit that the logical structure of mind is uniform for all 
races, nations, and classes. Marxism or racism, they assert, never in- 
tended to deny this undeniable fact. W7hat they really wanted to say 
was that historical understanding, aesthetic empathy, and value judg- 
ments are conditioned by a man's background. It is obvious that this 
interpretation cannot be supported on the basis of the writings of the 
champions of poIylogism. However, it must be analyzed as a doctrine 
of its own. 

There is no need to emphasize again that a man's value judgments 
and his choice of ends reflect his inborn bodily features and all the 
vicissitudes of his But it is a far cry from acknowlcdgment of 
this fact to the beIief that racial inheritance or class affiliation ulti- 
mately determines judgments of value and the choice of ends. The 
fundamental discrepancies in world view and patterns of behavior 
do not correspond to differences in race, nationality, or class affilia- 
tion. 

There is hardIy any greater divergence in value judgments than 
that benveen the ascetics and those eager to enjoy life lightheartedly. 
An unbridgeable guif separates devout monks and nuns from the rest 
of mankind. But there have been people dedicated to the monkish 
ideals among all races, nations, classes, and castes. Some of them were 
sons and daughters of kings and wealthy noblemen, others were beg- 
gars. St. Francis, Santa Clara, and their ardent followers were natives 
of Italy, whose other inhabitants cannot be described as weary of 
temporal things. Puritanism was Anglo-Saxon, but so was the lascivi- 
ousness of the British under the Tudors, the Stuarts, and the Han- 
overians. The nineteenth century's outstanding champion of asceti- 

15. Cf. above, pp. 4647. 

Human Action 

cism was Count Leo Tolstoy, a wealthy member of the profligate Rus- 
sian aristocracy. Tolstoy saw the pith of the philosophy he attacked 
embodied in Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata, a ~nasterpiece of the son 
of extremely poor parents. 

It is the same with aesthetic values. All races and nations have had 
both classic and romantic art. With all their ardent propaganda the 
Marxians have not succeedcd in bringing about a specifically prole- 
tarian art or literature. The "proletarian" writers, painters, and musi- 
cians have not created new styles and have not established new 
aesthetic values. What characterizes them is solely their tendency to 
call everything they detest "bourgeois" and everything they like 
"proletarian." 

Historical understanding both of the historian and of the acting 
man always reflects the personality of its author.1° But if the historian 
and the politician are imbued with the desire for truth, they will 
never let themselves be deluded by party bias, provided they are 
efficient and not inept. It is immaterial whether a historian or a poli- 
tician considers the interference of a certain factor beneficial or 
detrimental. He cannot derive any advantage from underrating or 
overrating the relevance of one of the operating factors. Only clumsy 
would-be historians believe that they can serve their cause by distor- 
tion. The biographies of Napoleon I and 111, of Bismarck, Marx, 
Gladstone, and Disraeli, the most disputed personalities of the past 
century, widely disagree with regard to value judgments; but they 
hardly disagree in their understanding of the role played by these 
men. 

This is no less true of the statesman's understanding. What use 

could a champion of Protestantism derive from misunderstanding 

the tremendous power and prestige of Catholicism, or a liberal from 

misunderstanding the relevance of socialist ideas? In order to suc- 

ceed a politician must see things as they are; whoever indulges in 

wishful thinking will certainly fail. Judgments of relevance differ 

friiiii jiibginents of due iil that they aim at the aI~praisaiof a state 

of affairs not dependent on the author's arbitrariness. They are 

colored by their author's personality and can therefore never be unan- 

imously agreed upon by all people. But here again we must raise the 

question: What advantage could a race or class derive from an 

"ideological" distortion of understanding? 

As has already been pointed out, the serious discrepancies to be 

found in historical studies are an outcome of differences in the field 

16. Cf. above, pp. 57-58. 

Economics and the Revolt Against Reason 

of the nonhistorical sciences and not in various modes of understand- 
ing. 

Today many historians and writers are imbued with the Marxian 
dogma that the realization of the socialist plans is both unavoidable 
and the supreme good, and that the labor movement is entrusted with 
the historical mission of accomplishing this task by a violent over- 
throw of the capitalist system. Starting from this tenet they take it 
as a matter of course that the parties of the "Left," the elect, in the 
pursuit of their policies, should resort to acts of violence and to 
murder. A revolution cannot be consummated by peaceful methods. 
It is not worth while to dwell upon such trifles as the butchering of 
the four daughters of the last Tsar, of Leon Trotsky, of tens of thou- 
sands of Russian bourgeois and so on. "You can't make an omelet 
without breaking eggs"; why explicitly mention the eggs broken? 
But, of course, it is different if one of those assailed ventures to de- 
fend himself or even to strike back. Few only mention the acts of 
sabotage, destruction, and violence committed by strikers. But a11 
authors enlarge upon the attempts of railroad companies to protect 
thcir property and the lives of their officers and their customers 
against such onslaughts. 

Such discrepancies are due neither to judgments of value nor to 
differences in understanding. They are thc outcome of antagonistic 
theories of economic and historical evolution. If the coming of social- 
ism is unavoidabIe and can be achieved only by revolutionary meth- 
ods, murders committed by the "progressives" are minor incidents 
of no significance. But the self-defense and counterattacks of the "re- 
actionaries" which can possibly delay the final victory of socialism 
are of the greatest importance. They are remarkable events, while 
the revolutionary acts are simply routine. 

6. The Case for Reason 
Judicious rationalists do not pretend that human reason can ever 
mala man omniscient. They are fully aware of the fact that, how- 
ever knowIedge may increase, there will always remain things ulti- 
matelv given and not liable to any further elucidation. But, they say, 
as farhs man is able to attain cognition, he must rely upon reason. The 
ultimate given is the irrational. The knowable is, as far it is known al- 
ready, necessarily rational There is neither an irrational mode of 
cognition nor a science of irrationality. 

With regard to unsolved problen~s, various hypotheses are per- 


Human Action 

missible provided they do not contradict logic and the uncontested 
data of experience. But these are hypotheses only. 

We do not know what causes the inborn diffcrences in human 
abilitics. Science is at a loss to explain why Newton and Mozart were 
full of creative genius and why most people are not. Bnt it is by all 
means an unsatisfactory answer to say that a genius owes his great- 
ness to his ancestry or to his race. The qucstion is precisely why such 
a man differs from his brothers and from the other members of his 
race. 

It is a little bit less faulty to attribute the great achievements of 
the white race to racial snperiority. Yet this is no more than a vague 
hypothesis which is at variance with the fact that the foundations of 
modern civilization were laid by pcoples of other races. We cannot 
Imow whcther or not at a later date other raccs will suppIant Western 
civjlization. 

However, such a hypothesis must be appraised on its own merits. 
Jt must not be condernnyd beforehand because the racists base on it 
their postulate that there is an irrcconcilahle conflict between various 
racial groups and that the superior races must enslave the inferior ones. 
Ricardo's law of association has long since discardcd this mistal\.cn 
interpretation of thc inequality of men.17 It is nonsensical to fiqht the 
racial hypothesis by negating obvious facts. It is vain to denv that up 
to now certain races have contributed nothing or very Iittle to the 
development of civilization and can, in this sense, be called inferior. 

If somebody were eager to distill at any cost a grain of truth out 
of the Marxian teachings. he could say tha; emotions influence a man's 
reasoning very much. Nobody ever vcntured to deny this obvious 
fact, and ~aixism cannot be credited with its discovcry. Rut it is 
without anv significance for epistemology. There are many sources 
both of success and of crror. It is the task of psychology to enumerate 
and to classify thcm. 

Envy is a widesprcad frailty. It is certain that many intellectuals 

envy thc higher income of prosperous businessmen and that these 

fcelings drive them toward socialism. They believe that the authori- 

ties of a socialist commonwealth would pa): them higher salaries than 

those that they earn under capitalism. But to provc the existcnce of 

this envy does not relieve science of the duty of making the most care- 

ful examination of the socialist doctrines. Scicntists are bound to deal 

with every doctrine as if its supporters were inspired by nothing 

else than thc thirst for knowledge. The various brands of polylogism 

substitute for a purely theorctical examination of opposite doctrines 

17. See below, pp. 158-163. 

Economics and the Revolt Against Reason 

the unmasking of the background and the motives of their authors. 
Such a procedure is incompatible with the first principles of ratio- 
cination. 

It is a poor makeshift to dispose of a theory by referring to its his- 
torical background, to the "spirit" of its time, to the material condi- 
tions of the country of its origin, and to any personal qualities of its 
authors. A theory is subject to the tribunal of reason only. The yard- 
stick to be applied is always the yardstick of reason. A theory is either 
correct or incorrect. It may happen that the present state of our 
knowledge does not allow a decision with regard to its correctness or 
incorrectness. But a theory can never be valid for a bourgeois or an 
American if it is invalid for a proletarian or a Chinese. 

If the Marxians and the racists were right, it would be impossible 
to explain why those in power are anxious to suppress dissenting 
theories and to persecute their supporters. The very fact that there 
are intolerant governments and political parties intent upon out- 
lawing and exterminating dissenters, is a proof of the excellence of 
reason. It is not a proof of a doctrine's correctness that its adversaries 
use the police, the hangman, and violent mobs to fight it. But it is a 
proof of the fact that those taking recourse to violent oppression are 
in their subconsciousness convinced of the untenability of their own 
doctrines. 

It is impossible to demonstrate the validity of the a priori founda- 
tions of logic and praxeology without referring to these founda- 
tions themselves. Reason is an ultimate given and cannot be analyzed 
or questioned by itself. The very existence of human reason is a non- 
rational fact. The only statement that can be predicated with regard 
to reason is that it is the mark that distinguishes man from animals 
and has brought about everything that is specifically human. 

To those pretending that man would be happier if he were to 
renounce the use of reason and try to let himself be guided by intui- 
tion and instincts only, no other answer can bc given than an analysis 
of the rrracture of Immm society: In descdhing the genesis md.wnrk-
ing of social cooperation, economics provides all the mformatlon re- 
quired for an ultimate decision between reason and unreason. If man 
reconsiders freeing himself from the supremacy of reason, hc must 
know what he will have to forsake. 


1V. A FIRST AhTALYSIS OF THE CATEGORY 

OF ACTION 

I. Ends and Means 
T 
T
HE result sought by an action is called its end, goal, or aim. One 
uses these terms in ordinary speech also to signify intermediate 
ends, goals, or aims; these are points which acting man wants to at- 
tain only because he believes that he will reach his ultimate end, goal, 
or aim in passing beyond them. StrictIy speaking the end, goal, or 
aim of any action is always the relief from a felt uneasiness. 

A means is what serves to the attainment of any end, goal, or aim. 
Means are not in the given universe; in this universe there exist only 
things. A thing becomes a means when human reason plans to employ 
it for the attainment of some end and human action really employs 
it for this purpose. Thinking man sees the serviceableness of things, 
i.e., their ability to minister to his ends, and acting man makes them 
means. It is of primary importance to realize that parts of the ex- 
ternal world become means only through the operation of the human 
mind and is offshoot, human action. External objects are as such 
only phenomena of the physical universe and the subject matter of 
the natural sciences. It is human meaning and action which trans- 
form them into means. Praxeology does not deaI with the external 
world, but with man's conduct with regard to it. Praxeological reality 
is not the physical universe, but man's conscious reaction to the 
given state of this universe. Economics is not about things and tan- 

oihl~mqterial rrhinrtr. ;+ ;c ahmat men the;" meanings and acdGns.

b"'-"'"L"""' "" "U'", "'U """"L """, L"-'L I..~LLI.I.I

J 

Goods, commodities, and wealth and all the other notions of con-
duct are not elements of nature; they are elements of human mean- 
ing and conduct. He who wants to deal with them must not look at 
the external world; he must search for them in the meaning of acting 
men. 

Praxeology and economics do not deal with human meaning and 
action as they should be or would be if all men were inspired by an 
absolutely valid philosophy and equipped with a perfect knowledge 
of technology. For such notions as absolute validity and omniscience 


A Fisst Analysis of the Category of Action 93 

there is no room in the frame of a science whose subject matter is 
erring man. An end is everything which men aim at. A means is 
every thing which acting men consider as such. 

It is the task of scientific technology and therapeutics to explodc 
errors in their respective fields. It is the task of economics to expose 
erroneous doctrines in the field of social action. But if men do not 
follow the advice of science, but cling to their fallacious prejudices, 
these errors are reality and must be dealt with as such. Economists 
consider foreign exchange control as inappropriate to attain the ends 
aimed at by those who take recourse to it. However, if public opinion 
does not abandon its delusions and governments consequently resort 
to foreign exchange control, the course of events is determined by 
this attitude. Present-day medicine considers the doctrine of the 
therapeutic effects of mandrake as a fable. But as long as people took 
this fable as truth, mandrake was an economic good and prices were 
paid for its acquisition. In dealing with prices economics does not 
ask what things are in the eyes of other people, but only what they 
are in the meaning of those intent upon getting them. For it deals 
with real prices, paid and received in real transactions, not with prices 
as they would be if men were different from what they really are. 

Means are necessarily always limited, i.e., scarce with regard to 
the services for which man wants to use them. If this were not the 
case, there would not be any action with regard to them. Where man 
is not restrained by the insufficient quantity of things available, there 
is no need for any action. 

It is customary to call the end the ultimate good and the means 
goods. In applying this terminology economists mainly used to think 
as technologists and not as praxeologists. They differentiated be- 
tween free goods and economic goods. They called free goods things 
available in superfluous abundance which man does not need to 
economize. Such goods are, however, not the object of any action. 
They are general conditions of human welfare; they are parts of the 
natural environment in which man lives and acts. Only the economic 
goods are the substratum of action. They alone are dealt with in 
econon~ics. 

Economic goods which in themselves are fitted to satisfy human 

wants directly and whose serviceableness does not depend on the 

cooperation of other economic goods, are called consumers' goods or 

goods of the first order. Means which can satisfy wants only indirectly 

when complemcntcd by cooperation of other goods are called pro- 

duccrs' goods or factors of production or goods of a remoter or 

higher order. The services rendered by a producers' good consist 


Human Action 

in bringing about, by the cooperation of complementary producers' 
goods, a product. This product may be a consumers' good; it may be 
a producers' good which when combined with other producers' goods 
will finally bring about a consumers' good. It is possible to think of the 
producers' goods as arranged in orders according to their proximity 
to the consumers' good for whose production they can be used. Those 
producers' goods which are nearest to the production of a consumers' 
good are ranged in the second order, and accordingly those which are 
used for the production of goods of the second order in the third order 
and so on. 

The purpose of such an arrangement of goods in orders is to pro- 
vide a basis for the theory of value and prices of the factors of pro- 
duction. It will be shown later how the valuation and the prices of 
the goods of higher orders are dependent on the valuation and the 
prices of the goods of lower orders produced by their expenditure. 
The first and ultimate valuation of external things refers only to 
consumers' goods. All other things are vaIued according to the part 
they play in the production of consumers' goods. 

It is therefore not necessary actually to arrange producers' goods 
in various orders from the second to the nth. It is no less superfluous to 
enter into pedantic discussions of whether a concrete good has to be 
called a good of the lowest order or should rather be attributed to one 
of the higher orders. Whether raw coffee beans or roast coffee beans 
or ground coffee or coffee prepared for drinking or only coffee pre- 
pared and mixed with cream and sugar are to be called a consumers' 
good ready for consumption is of no importance. It is immaterial 
which manner of speech we adopt. For with regard to the problem 
of valuation, all that we say about a consumers' good can be applied 
to any good of a higher order (except those of the highest order) if we 
consider it as a product. 

An economic good does not necessarily have to be embodied in a 
tangible thing. Nonmaterial economic goods are called services. 

2. The Scale of Value 
Acting man chooses between various opportunities offered for 
choice. He prefers one alternative to others. 

It is customary to say that acting man has a scale of wants or values 
in his mind when he arranges his actions. On the basis of such a scale 
he satisfies what is of higher value, i.e., his more urgent wants, and 
leaves unsatisfied what is of lower value, i.e., what is a less urgent want. 


A First Analysis of the Category of Action 95 

There is no objection to such a presentation of the state of affairs. 
However, one must not forget that the scale of vaIues or wants mani- 
fests itself only in the reality of action. These scaIes have no inde- 
pendent existence apart from the actual behavior of individuals. The 
only source from which our knowIedge concerning these scales is de- 
rived is the observation of a man's actions. Every action is always 
in perfect agreement with the scale of values or wants because these 
scales are nothing but an instrument for the interpretation of a man's 
acting. 

Ethical doctrines are intent upon establishing scales of value ac- 
cording to which man should act but does not necessarily always act. 
They claim for themselves the vocation of telling right from wrong 
and of advising man concerning what he should aim at as the supreme 
good. They are normative disciplines aiming at the cognition of 
what ought to be. They are not neutral with regard to facts; they 
judge them from the point of view of freely adopted standards. 

This is not the attitude of praxeology and economics. They are 
fully awarc of the fact that the ultimate ends of human action are not 
open to examination from any absolute standard. Ultimate ends are 
ultimately given, they are purely subjective, they differ with various 
people and with the same people at various moments in their lives. 
Praxeology and economics deal with the means for the attainment of 
ends chosen by the acting individuals. They do not express any 
opinion with regard to such problems as whether or not sybaritism 
is better than asceticism. They apply to the means only one yard- 
stick, viz., whether or not they are suitablc to attain the ends at which 
the acting individuals aim. 

The notions of abnormality and perversity therefore have no place 
in economics. It does not say that a man is perverse because he prefers 
the disagreeable, the detrimental, and the painful to the agreeable, the 
beneficial, and the pleasant. It says only that he is different from other 
people; that he likes what others detest; that he considers useful what 
other': want to avnid; chat he takes pleasure it: endwing pain which 
others avoid because it hurts them. The polar notions normal and 
perverse can be used anthropoIogically for the distinction between 
those who behave as most people do and outsiders and atypical ex- 
ceptions; they can be applied biologically for the distinction between 
those whose behavior preserves the vital forces and those whose be- 
havior is self-destructive; they can be appIied in an ethical sense for 
the distinction between those who behave correctly and those who 
act otherwise than they should. However, in the frame of a theoretical 


Human Action 

science of human action, there is no room for such a distinction. Any 
examination of ultimate ends turns out to be purely subjective anc! 
therefore arbitrary. 

Value is the importance that acting man attaches to ultimate ends. 
Only to ultimate ends is primary and original value assigned. Means are 
valued derivatively according to their serviceableness in contributing 
to the attainment of ultimate ends. Their valuation is derived from the 
valuation of the respective ends. They are important for man only 
as far as they make it possible for him to attain some ends. 

Value is not intrinsic, it is not in things. It is within us; it is the 
way in which man reacts to the conditions of his environment. 

Neither is value in words and in doctrines. It is reflected in human 

conduct. It is not what a man or groups of men say about value that 

counts, but how they act. The bombastic oratory of moraIists and 

the inflated pompousness of party programs are significant as such. 

But they influence the course of human events only as far as they 

really determine the actions of men. 

3. The Scale of Needs 
Notwithstanding all declarations to the contrary, the immense ma- 

jority of men aim first of all at an improvement of the material con- 

ditions of well-being. They want more and better food, better homes 

and clothes, and a thousand other amenities. They strive after abun- 

dance and health. Taking these goals as given, applied physiology tries 

to determine what means are best suited to provide as much sat- 

isfaction as possibIe. It distinguishes, from this point of view, be-

tween man's "real" needs and imaginary and spurious appetites. It 

teaches people how they should act and what they should aim at as a 

means. 

The importance of such doctrines is obvious. From his point of 

view the physiologist is right in distinguishing between sensible action 

and action contrary to purpose. Fie is right in contrasting judicious 

methods of nourishment from unwise methods. He may condemn 

certain modes of behavior as absurd and opposed to "real" needs. 

However, such judgments are beside the point for a science dealing 

with the reality of human action. Not what a man should do, but 

what he does, counts for praxeology and economics. Hygiene may be 

right or wrong in calling alcohol and nicotine poisons. But economics 

must explain the prices of tobacco and liquor as they are, not as they 

would be under different conditions. 

There is no room left in the field of economics for a scale of 


A First Analysis of the Category of Action 

needs different from the scale of values as reflected in man's actual 
behavior. Economics deals with real man, weak and subject to error 
as he is, not with ideal beings, omniscient and perfect as only gods 
could be. 

4. Action as an Exchange 
Action is an attempt to substitute a more satisfactory state of af- 
fairs for a less satisfactory one. We call such a wilIfully induced al- 
teration an exchange. A less desirable condition is bartered for a 
more desirable. What gratifies less is abandoned in order to attain 
something that pleases more. That which is abandoned is called the 
price paid for the attainment of the end sought. The value of the 
price paid is calIed costs. Costs are equal to the value attached to the 
satisfaction which one must forego in order to attain the end aimed 
at. 

The difference between the value of the price paid (the costs in- 
curred) and that of the goal attained is called gain or profit or net 
yield. Profit in this primary sense is purely subjectivc, it is an increase 
in the acting man's happiness, it is a psychical phenomenon that can 
be neither measured nor weighed. There is a more and a less in the 
removal of uneasiness felt; but how much one satisfaction surpasses 
another one can onIy be felt; it cannot be establishcd and determined 
in an objective way. A judgment of value does not measure, it ar- 
ranges in a scale oi degrees, it grades. It is expressive of an order of 
preference and sequencc, but not expressive of measure and weight. 
Only the ordinal numbers can be applied to it, but not the cardinal 
numbers. 

It is vain to speak of any calculation of values. Calculation is pos- 

sible only with cardinal numbers. The difference between the valua- 

tion of two states of affairs is entirely psychical and personal. It is 

not open to any projection into the external world. It can be sensed 

only by the individual. It cannot be communicated or imparted to 

any fellow- man. It is an intensive magnitude. 

~h~siology

and psychology have developed various methods by 
means of which they pretend to have attained a substitute for the 
unfeasible measurement of intensive magnitudes. There is no need 
for economics to enter into an examination of these rather question- 
able makeshifts. Their supporters themselves realize that they are not 
applicable to value judgments. But even if they were, they would not 
have any bearing on economic problems. For economics deals with 
action as such, and not with the psychicaI facts that result in definite 
actions. 


Hunzarz Action 

It happens again and again that an action does not attain the end 
soughr. Sometimes the result, although inferior to the end aimed at, 
is still an improvcmcnt when comparcd with the previous state of 
affairs; then therc is still a profit, although a smaller onc than that 
expcctcd. But it can happen that the action produces a statc of affairs 
less desirablc than the previous statc it was intendcd to alter. Then 
the difference between the valuation of the rcsult and the costs in- 
curred is called loss. 


V. TIME 
I. The TemporaI Character of Praxeology 
T 
T
HE notion of change implies the notion of temporal sequence. A 
rigid, eternally immutable universe would be out of the, but 
it would be dead. The concepts of change and of time are inseparably 
linked together. Action aims at change and is therefore in the 
temporal order. I-Iurnan reason is even ~ncapable of conceiving the 
ideas of timeless existence and of timeless action. 

He who acts distinguishes between the time before the action, 
the time absorbed by the action, and the time after the action has 
been finished. He cannot be neutral with regard to the lapse of 
time. 

Logic and mathematics deal with an ideal system of thought. The 
relations and implications of their system are coexistent and interdc- 
pendent. We may say as n-cll that thev are synchronous or that they 
are out of time. A pcrfect mind coulc< grasp them all in one thought. 
Man's inability to accomplish this n~altcs thinking itself an action. pro- 
ceeding step by step from the less satisfactory state of insufficient 
cognition to the more satisfactory state of better insight. But the 
temporal order in which knowledge is acquired must not be confused 
with the logical simultaneity of a11 parts of this aprioristic deductive 
svstein. Within this systcm the notions of anteriority and consequence 
a& metaphorical only. They do not refer to the svstem, but to our 
action in grasping it. The system itself implies neithkr the category of 
time nor that of causality. There is functional correspondence be- 
tween elements, but there is neither cause nor effect. 

What distinguishes the praxeological svstem from the logical sys- 
tem epistemologically is precisely that it implies the categories both of 
timc and of causality. The praxeological system too is aprioristic and 
deductive. As a svstem it is out of time. But change is one of its ele- 
ments. The notions of sooner and later and of cause and effect are 
among its constituents. Anteriority and consequence are essential 
concepts of praxeological reasoning. So is the irreversibility of events. 
In the frame of the praxeological system any reference to functionaI 
correspondence is no less metaphbrical and misleading than is the 


Human Action 

reference to anteriority and consequence in the frame of the logical 
system.' 

2. Past, Present, and Future 
11 is acting that provides man with the notion of tirne and makes 
him aware of the flux of time. The idea of time is a praxeological 
category. 

Action is always directed toward the future; it is essentially and 
necessarily always a planning and acting for a better future. Its aim 
is always to render future conditions more satisfactory than they 
would be without the interference of action. The uneasiness that 
inipels a man to act is caused by a dissatisfaction with expected future 
conditions as they would probably develop if nothing were done to 
alter them. In any case action can influence only thc future, never 
the present that with every infinitesimal fraction of a second sinks 
down into the past. Man becomes conscious of time when he plans to 
convert a less satisfactory present state into a more satisfactory future 
state. 

For contcmplative meditation time is merely duration, "la dude 
pure, dont l'tcoulement est continu, et oh 1,011 passe, par gradations 
insensibles, d'un Ctat i l'autrc: ContinuitC rkellement vkcue." The 
"now" of the present is continualIy shifted to the past and is retained 
in the memory only. Reflecting about the past, say the philosophers, 
man becomes aware of tin~e.~ 

However, it is not recollection that 
conveys to man the categories of change and of time, but the will 
to improve the conditions of his life. 

'Time as we measure it by various mechanical devices is always 
past, and time as the philosophers use this concept is always either 
past or future. The present is, from these aspects, nothing but an 
ideal boundary line separating the past from the future. But from 
the praxeological aspect there is between the past and the future a 

cxten,je';preseiic. Acdoii is .as in rhe Tea: present becaiise 
it utilizes the instant and thus embodies its real it^.^ Later retrospective 

I. In a treatise on economics there is no need to enter into a discussion of the 
endeavors to construct mechanics as an axiomatic system in which the concept 
of function is substituted for that of cause and effect. It will be shown later that 
axiomatic mechanics cannot serve as a model for the treatment of the economic 
system. Cf. below, pp. 351-354.

Time rot 

reflection discerns in the instant passed away first of all the action 
and the conditions which it offered to action. That which can no 
longer be done or consumed because the opportunity for it has 
passed away, contrasts the past wi:h the present. That which cannot 
yet be done or consumed, because the conditions for undertaking it 
or the time for its ripening have not yet come, contrasts the future 
with the past. The present offers to acting opportunities and tasks 
for which it was hitherto too early and for which it will be hereafter 
too late. 

The present qua duration is the continuation of the conditions and 
opportunities given for acting. Every kind of action requires special 
conditions to which it must be adjusted with regard to the aims 
sought. The concept of the present is therefore different for various 
fields of action. It has no reference whatever to the various methods 
of measuring the passing of time by spatial movements. The present 
encloses as much of the time passed away as still is actual, i.e., of 
importance for acting. The present contrasts itself, according to the 
various actions one has in view, with the Middle Ages, with the nine- 
teenth century, with the past year, month, or day, but no less with 
the hour, minute, or second just passed away. If a man says: Nowa- 
days Zeus is no longer worshiped, he has a present in mind other than 
that the motorcar driver who thinks: Now it is still too early to 
turn. 

As the future is uncertain it always remains undecided and vague 
how much of it we can consider as now and present. If a man had 
said in I 91j: At present-now-in Europe freedom of thought is 
undisputed, he would have not foreseen that this present would very 
soon be a past. 

3. The Economization of Time 
Man is subject to the passing of time. He comes into existence, 

grows, becomes old, and passes away. His time is scarce. He must 

economize it as he does other scarce factors. 

The economization of time has a peculiar character because of 

the uniqueness and irreversibility of the temporal order. The impor- 

tance of these facts manifests itself in every part of the theory of 

action. 

Only one fact must be stressed at this point. The economization of 

time is independent of the economization of economic goods and serv- 

ices. Even in the land of Cockaigne man would be forced to economize 

time, provided he were not immortal and not endowed with eternal 


Human Action 

youth and indestructible health and vigor. Although all his appetites 
could be satisfied immediately without any expenditure of labor, he 
would have to arrange his time schedule, as there are states of satis- 
faction which are incompatible and cannot be consummated at the 
same time. For this man, too, time would be scarce and subject to the 
aspect of sooner and later. 

4. The Temporal Relation Between Actions 
Two actions of an individual are never synchronous; their temporal 
relation is that of sooncr and later. Actions of various individuals can 
be considered as synchronous only in the light of the physical ~neth- 
ods for the measurement of time. Synchronism is a praxeological 
notion only wirh regard to the concerted efforts of various acting 
men.s 

A man's individual actions succeed one another. They can never be 
effected at the same instant; they can only follow one another in 
more or less rapid succession. There arc actions which serve several 
purposes at one blow. It would be misleading to refer to them as a 
coincidence of various actions. 

People have oftcn failcd to recognize the meaning of the tern1 
"scale of value" and have disregarded the obstacles preventing the 
assun~ption of synchronism in the various actions of an individual. 
They have interpreted a man's various acts as the outcome of a scale 
of value, independent of these acts and preceding them, and of a 
previously devised plan whose realization they aim at. The scale of 
value and the plan to which duration and in~mutability for a certain 
period of time wcre attributed, were hypostasized into the cause 
and motive of the various individual actions. Synchronism which 
could not be asserted with regard to various acts was then easily 
discovered in the scale of value and in the plan. But this overlooks the 
fact that the scale of value is nothing but a constructed tool of thought. 
The scale of value manifests itself only in real acting; it can be dis- 
cerned only from the observation of real acting. It is therefore im- 
permissible to contrast it with real acting and to use it as a yardstick 
for the appraisal of real actions. 

It is no less impermissible to differentiate between rational and 
allegedly irrational acting on the basis of a comparison of real acting 
with earlier drafts and plans for future actions. It may be very in- 

5. In order to avoid any possible misunderstanding it may be expedient to 
emphasize that this theorem has nothin at all to do with Einstein's theorem con- 
cerning the temporal relation of spatiaty distant events.

teresting that yesterday goals were set for today's acting other than 
those really aimed at today. But yesterday's pIans do not provide us 
with any more objective and nonarbitrary standard for the appraisal 
of today's real acting than any other ideas and norms. 

Thc attempt has been made to attain the notion of a nonrational 
action by this reasoning: If a is preferred to b and b to c, logically a 
should be preferred to c. BLI~if actually c is preferred to a, we are 
faced with a mode of acting to which we cannot ascribe consistency 
and rational it^.^ This reasoning disregards the fact that two acts of 
an individual can never be synchronous. If in one action a is prefcrred 
to b and in another action b to c, it is, howevcr short the interval be- 
tween the nvo actions may be, not permissible to construct a uniform 
scale of value in which n precedcs h and b precedes c. Nor is it per- 
missible to consider a later third action as coincident with the two 
previous actions. A11 that the example proves is that vaIue judgments 
are not immutable and that therefore a scale of value, which is ab- 
stracted from various, necessarily nonsynchronous actions of an in- 
dividual, may bc self-c~ntradictory.~ 

Onc must not confuse the logical concept of consistency (viz., ab- 
sence of contradiction) and the praxeological concept of consistency 
(viz., constancy or clinging to the same principles). Logical con-
sistency has its place only in thii-king, constancy has its place only 
in acting. 

Constancy and rationality are entirely different notions. If one's 
valuations have changed, unremitting faithfulness to the once espoused 
principles of action merely for the sake of constancy would not be 
rational but simply stubborn. Only in one respect can acting be con- 
stant: in preferring the more valuablc to the less valuable. If the valu- 
ations changc, acting must change also. Faithfulness, under changed 
conditions, to an old plan would be nonsensical. A logical system must 
be consistent and free of contradictions because it impIies the coex- 
istence of all its parts and theorems. In acting, which is necessarily 
in the temporal order, there cannot be any question of such con- 
sistency. Acting must be suited to purpose, and purposefulness re- 
quires adjustment to changing conditions. 

Presence of mind is considercd a virtue in acting man. A man has 
presence of mind if he has the ability to think and to adjust his acting 
so quickly that the interval between thc emergence of new conditions

Human Action 
and the adaptation of his actions to them becomes as short as possible. 
If constancy is viewed as faithfulness to a plan once designed without 
regard to changes in conditions, then presence of mind and quick 
reaction arc the very opposite of constancy. 
When the speculator goes to the stock exchange, he may sketch a 
definite plan for his operations. Whcther or not he clings to this plan, 
his actions are rational also in the sense which those eager to distin- 
guish rational acting from irrational attribute to the term "rational." 
This speculator in the course of the day may embark upon transac- 
tions which an observer, not taking into account the changes occurring 
in market conditions, wiil not bc able to interpret as the outcome of 
constant behavior. But thc speculator is firm in his intention to make 
profits and to avoid losses. Accordingly he must adjust his conduct 
to the change in market conditions and in his own judgment con-
cerning the future development of pric~s.~ 
However one twists things, one will ncvcr succeed in formulating 
the notion of "irrational" action whose "jrrationality" is not founded 
upon an arbitrary judgment of value. Let us suppose that somebody 
has chosen to act inconstantly for no other purpose than for the sake 
of refuting the praxeological assertion that there is no irrational action. 
What happens here is that a man aims at a peculiar goal, viz., the ref- 
utation of a praxeologicaI theorcm, and that he accordingly acts dif- 
ferently from what he would have done otherwise. He has chosen an 
unsuitable means for the refutation of praxeology, that is all. 

8. Plans too, of course, may be self-contradictory. Sometimes their contradic- 
tions may be the effect of mistaken judgment. But sometimes such contradictions 
may be intentional and serve a definite purpose. If, for instance, a publicized 
program of a government or a political party promises high prices to the pro- 
ducers and at the same time low prices to the consumers, the purpose of such an 
espousal of incom atible goals may be demagogic. Then the program, the pub- 
licized plan, is sel!contmadictory; but the plan of its authors who wanted to at- 
tain a definite end through the endorsement of incompatible aims and their pub- 
lic announcement, is free of any contradiction. 

VI. UNCERTAINTY 
I. Uncertainty and ..Acting 
T 
T
aE uncertainty of the future is already implied in the very notion 
of action. That man acts and that the future is uncertain are 
by no means two independent matters. They are only two different 
modes of establishing one thing. 

We may assume that the outcome of all events and changes is 
uniquely determined by eternal unchangeable laws governing be- 
coming and development in the whole universe. We may consider the 
necessary connection and interdependence of all phenomena, i.e., 
their causal concatenation, as the fundamental and ultimate fact. We 
may entirely discard the notion of undetermined chance. But how- 
ever that may be, or appear to the mind of a perfect intelligence, the 
fact remains that to acting man the future is hidden. If man knew the 
future, he would not have to choose and would not act. He would 
be like an automaton, reacting to stimuli without any will of his own. 

Some philosophers are prepared to explode the notion of man's 
will as an illusion and self-deception because man must un\vittingly 
behave according to the inevitable laws of causality. They may be 
right or wrong from the point of view of the prime mover or the 
cause of itself. However, from the human point of view action is the 
ultimate thing. We do not assert that man is "free" in choosing and 
acting. We merely establish the fact that he chooses and acts and that 
we are at a loss to use the methods of the natural sciences for answer- 
ing the question why he acts this way and not otherwise. 

hTatural science does not render the future predictable. It makes 
it possible to foretell the results to be obtained by definite actions. 
But it leaves impredictable two spheres: that of insufficiently known 
natural phenomena and that of human acts of choice. Our ignorance 
with regard to these two spheres taints all human actions with un- 
certainty. Apodictic certainty is only within the orbit of the deduc- 
tive system of aprioristic theory. The most that can be attained with 
regard to reality is probability. 

It is not the task of praxeology to investigate whether or not it is 
permissible to consider as certain some of the theorems of the em- 


I 06 Human Action 

pirical natural scienccs. This problem is without practical importancc 
for praxeological considerations. At any rate, the theorems of physics 
and chemistry have such a high degree of probability that we are en- 
titled to call them certain for all practical purposes. We can practically 
forecast the working of a machine constructed according to the rules 
of scicntific technology. Rut the construction of a machine is only 
a part in a broader program that aims at supplying the consumers 
with the machine's products. Whether this was or was not the most 
appropriate plan depends on the development of future conditions 
which at the time of the plan's execution cannot be forecast with 
certainty. Thus the degree of certainty with regard to the techno- 
logicaI outcome of the machine's construction, whatever it may be, 
does not removc the uncertainty inherent in thc whole action. Future 
needs and valuations, the reaction of men to changes in conditions, 
future scientific and technological knowledge, future ideologies and 
policies can ncver be foretold with more than a greater or smaller de- 
gree of probability. Every action refers to an unknown future. It is 
in this sense always a risky speculation. 

The problems of truth and certainty concern the general theory 
of human knowledge. The problem of probability, on the other hand, 
is a primary conccrn of praxeology. 

2. The ,Meaning of Probability 
The treatment of probability has been confused by the mathemati- 
cians. From the beginning there was an ambiguity in dealing with the 
calculus of probability. When the Chevalier de 3461-6 consulted Pascal 
on the problems involved in the games of dice, the great mathematician 
should have frankly told his friend the truth, namely, that mathematics 
cannot be of any use to the gambler in a game of pure chance. In- 
stead he wrapped his answer in the symbolic language of mathematics. 
What could easily be explained in a few sentcnccs of mundane speech 
was expressed in a tcr&inology which is unfamiliar to the immense 
majority and therefore regarded with reverential awe. People sus- 
pected that the puzzling formulas contain somc important revelations, 
hidden to the uninitiated; they got the impression that a scicntific 
method of gambling exists and that the esoteric teachings of mathe- 
matics provide a key for winning. The heavenly mystic Pascal un- 
intentionally became the patron saint of gambling. The textbooks of 
the calculus of probability gratuitously propagandize for the gam- 
bling casinos prccisely because they arc sealed books to the layman. 

No less havoc was spread by the equivocations of the calculus of 


Uncertainty 107 

prohatditv in the field of scientific research. The history of every 
lmnch of Iinowlcdge records instances of the misapplication of the 
cnlculus of probability ~vhich, as John Stuart Adill observed, made 
ie "the real opprobri;m of mathematics." l Some of the worst er- 
rors have arisen in our day in the interpretation of the methods of 
physics. 

The problcm of probable infercncc is rriuch bigger than those 
problcrns nhich constitute the field of the calculus of probability. 
Only preoccupation kvith the mathematical treatment could result 
in tl;e prejudice that probability always means frequency. 

X further error confused the problem of probability with the 
problem of inductive reasoning as applied by the natural sciences. The 
attempt to substitute a universal theory of probability for the category 
of causaIity characterizes an abortive mode of philosophizing, very 
fashionablk only a few years ago. 

A statemcnt is probable if our knowledge concerning its content 
is deficient. We do not know everything which would be required 
for a definite decision between true and not true. But, on the other 
hand, we do know something about it; we are in a position to say 
more than simply non Ziqzm or ignoramz~s. 

There are two entirely different instances of probability; we may 
call them class prolnbility (or frequency probability) and case prob- 
abiIity (or the specific understanding of the sciences of human action). 
The field for the application of the former is the field of thc natural 
sciences, entirely ruled by causality; the field for the application of 
the latter is the field of the sciences of human action, entirely ruled by 
tcleology. 

3. Class ProbabiIity 
Class probability means: We know or assume to know, with regard 
to the problem concerned, everything about the behavior of a wholc 
class of events or phenomena; but about the actual singular events or 
phenomena we know nothing but that they are elements of this class. 

Wc know, for instance, that there are ninety tickets in a lottery 
and that five of them will be drau7n. Thus we know all about the be- 
havior of the whole class of tickets. But with regard to the singular 
tickets we do not know anything but that they are elements of this 
class of tickets. 

We have a complcte table of n~ortality for a definite period of the 
past in a definite area. If we assume that with regard to mortaIity no

pression, London, 1936).p. 353. 

Human Action 

changes will occur, we may say that we know everything about the 
mortality of the whole population in question. But with regard to the 
life expectancy of the individuals we do not know anything but that 
they are members of this class of people. 

For this defective knowledge the calculus of probability provides 
a presentation in symbols of the mathematical terminology. It neither 
expands nor deepens nor complements our knowledge. It translates 
it into mathematical language. Its calculations repeat in algebraic for- 
mulas what we knew beforehand. They do not lead to results that 
would tell us anything about the actual singular events. And, of 
course, they do not add anything to our Itnowledge concerning the 
behavior of the whole class, as this knowledge was already perfect- 
or was considered perfect-at the very outset of our consideration 
of the matter. 

It is a serious mistake to believe that the calculus of probability 
provides the gambler with any information which could remove or 
lessen the risk of gambling. It is, contrary to popular fallacies, quite 
useless for the gambler, as is any other mode of logical or mathematical 
reasoning. It is the characteristic mark of gambling that it deals with 
the unknown, with pure chance. The gambler's hopes for success 
are not based on substantial considerations. The nonsuperstitious 
gambler thinks: "There is a slight chance [or, in other words: 'it is 
not impossible'] that I may win; I am ready to put up the stake re- 
quired. I know very well that in putting it up I am behaving like a 
fool. But the biggest fools have the most luck. Anyway!" 

Cool reasoning must show the gambler that he does not improve 
his chances by buving two tickets instead of one of a lottery in which 
the total amount-of the winnings is smaller than the proceeds from 
the sale of all tickets. If he were to buy all the tickets, he would 
certainly lose a part of his outlay. Yet every lottery customer is 
firmly convinced that it is better to buy more tickets than less. The 
habinlks of the casinos and slot machines nevcr q.Thev dc! not mi~l~

a thought to the fact that, because the ruling odds favdr the banker 

over the plaver, the outcome will the more certainly result in a loss 

for them the'longer they continue to play. The lure of gambling con- 

sists precisely in its unpredictability and its adventurous vicissitudes. 

Let us assume that ten tickets, each bearing the name of a different 

man, are put into a box. One ticket will be drawn, and the man whose 

name it bears will be liable to pay loo dollars. Then an insurer can 

promise to the loser fulI indemnification if he is in a position to insure 

each of the ten for a premium of ten dollars. He will collect roo 

dollars and will have to pay the same amount to one of the ten. But 


Uncertainty I09 

if he were to insure one only of thcnl at a rate fixed by the calculus, he 
would embark not upon an insurance business, but upon gambling. 
He would substitute himself for the insured. He would collect ten 
dollars and would get the chance either of kceping it or of losing that 
ten dollars and ninety dollars more. 

If a man promises to pay at the death of another man a definite 
sum and charges for this promise the amount adequate to the life 
expectancy as determined by the calculus of probability, he is not 
an insurer but a gambler. Insurance, whether conducted according to 
business principles or according to the principle of mutuality, re- 
quires the insurance of a whole class or what can reasonably be con- 
sidered as such. Its basic idea is pooling and distribution of risks, not 
the calculus of probability. The mathematical operations that it re- 
quires are the four elementary operations of arithmetic. The calculus 
of probability is mere by-play. 

This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the elimination of hazard- 
ous risk by pooling can also be effected without any recourse to 
actuarial n~ethods. Everybody practices it in his daily life. Every busi- 
nessman includes in his normal cost accounting the cornpensation for 
losses which regularly occur in the conduct of affairs. "Regularly" 
means in this context: The amount of these losses is Imown as far as 
the whole class of the various items is concerned. The fruit dealer 
may know, for instance, that one of every fifty apples will rot in this 
stock; but he does not know to which individual apple this will hap- 
pen. He deals with such Iosses as with any other item in the bill of 
costs. 

The definition of the essence of class probability as given above 

is the only logically satisfactory one. It avoids the crude circularity 

implied in all definirions referring to the equiprobability of possible 

events. In stating that we know nothing about actuaI singular events 

except that they are elements of a class the behavior of which is fully 

known, this vicious circle is disposed of. Moreaver, it is superfluous 

to add a fiirtlier condition caiicd he absence of any reguiarity in the 

sequence of the singular events. 

The characteristic mark of insurance is that it deals with the whole 

class of events. As we pretend to know everything about the be- 

havior of the whole class, there seems to be no specific risk involved 

in the conduct of the business. 

Seither is there any specific risk in the business of the keeper of a 

gambling bank or in the enterprise of a lottery. From the point of 

view of the lottery enterprise the outcome is predictable, provided 

that all tickets have been sold. If some tickets remain unsold, the 


I 10 Human Action 

enterpriser is in the same position with regard to them as every buyer 
of a ticket is with regard to the tickets he bought. 

4. Case Probability 
Case probability means: We know, w-ith regard to a particular 
event, some of the factors which determine its outcome; but there are 
other determining factors about which we know nothing. 

Case probability has nothing in common with class probability but 
the incompleteness of our knowledge. In every other regard the two 
are entirely different. 

There are, of course, many instances in which men try to forecast 
a particular future event on the basis of their knowledge about the 
behavior of the class. A doctor may determine the chances for the 
full recovery of his patient if he knows that 70 per cent of those 
afflicted with the same disease recover. If he expresses his judgment 
correctly, he will not say more than that the probability of recovery 
is 0.7, that is, that out of ten patients not more than three on the 
average die. All such predictions about external events, i.e., events 
in the field of the natural sciences, are of this character. They are in 
fact not forecasts about the issue of the case in question, but state- 
ments about the frequency of the various possible outcomes. They 
are based either on statis&al information or simply on the rough 
estimate of the frequency derived from nonstatis;ical experience. 

So far as such types of probable statements are concerned, we are 
not faced with case probability. In fact we do not ltnow anything 
about the case in question except that it is an instance of a class the 
behavior of which we ltnow or think w-e know. 

A surgeon tells a patient who considers submitting himself to an 
operation that thirty out of every hundred undergoing such an 
operation die. If the patient asks whether this number of deaths is 
already full, he has misunderstood the sense of the doctor's state-
ment. He has fallen prey to the error known as the "gambler's fal- 
lacy." Like the roulette player who concludes from a run of ten red 
in succession that the probability of the next turn being black is noxv 
greater than it was before the run, he confuses case probability with 
class probability. 

All medical prognoses, when based only on physiological knowl- 
edge, deal with class probability. A doctor who hears that a man he 
does not know has been seized by a definite illness will, on the basis 
of his general medical experience, say: His chances for recovery are 
7 to 3. If the doctor himself treats the patient, he may have a different 


Uncertainty 111 

opinion. The patient is a young, vigorous man; he was in good health 
before he was taken with the illness. In such cases, the doctor may 
think, the mortality figures are lower; the chances for this patient are 
not 7: 3, but 9: r. The logical approach remains the same, although it 
may be based not on a collection of statistical data, but simply on a 
more or less exact rtsumC of the doctor's own experience with pre- 
vious cases. What the doctor knows is akways only the behavior of 
classes. In our instance the class is the class of young, vigorous men 
seized by the illness in question. 

Case roba ability is a particular feature of our dealing with prob- 
lems of human action. Here any reference to frequency is inappropri- 
ate, as our statcments always deal with unique events which as such 
-i.e., with regard to the problem in question-are not members of 
any class. We can form a class "American presidential elections." 
This class concept may prove useful or even necessary for various 
kinds of reasoning, as, for instance, for a treatment of the matter from 
the viewpoint of constitutional law. But if we are dealing with the 
election of 1944-either, before the election, with its future out- 
come or, after the election, with an analysis of the factors which 
determined the outcome-we are grappling with an individual, 
unique, and nonrepeatable case. The case is characterized by its unique 
merits, it is a class bv itself. All the marks which make it permissible to 
subsume it under any class are irrelevant for the problem in question. 

Two football teams, the Blues and the Yellows, will play tomorrow. 
In the past the Blues have always defeated the Yellows. This knowl- 
edge is not knowledge about a class of events. If we were to consider 
it as such, we would have to conclude that the BIues are always 
victorious and that the Yellows are always defeated. We wouId not 
be uncertain with regard to the outcome of the game. We would 
know for certain that the Blues will win again. The mere fact that 
we consider our forecast about tomorrow's game as only probabIe 
shows that we do not argue this way. 

On the other hand, we believe that the fact that the Blues were 
victorious in the past is not immaterial with regard to the outcome 
of tomorrow's game. We consider it as a favorable prognosis for the 
repeated success of the Blues. If we were to argue correctly accord- 
ing to the reasoning appropriate to class probability, we would not 
attach any importance to this fact. If we were not to resist the 
erroneous conclusion of the "gambler's fallacy," we would, on the 
contrary, argue that tomorrow's game will result in the success of 
the Ycllows. 

If we risk some money on the chance of one team's victory, the 


Human Action 

lawyers would qualify our action as a bet. They would call it gam- 
bling if class probability were involved. 

Everything that outside the field of class probability is commonly 
irnplied in the tern1 probability refers to the peculiar mode of rea- 
soning involved in dealing with historical uniqueness or individuality, 
the specific understanding of the historical sciences. 

Understanding is always based on incomplete Imowledge. \t7e may 
know the motives of the acting men, the ends they are aiming at, and 
the means they plan to apply for the attainment of these ends. We 
have a definite opinion with regard to the effects to be expected from 
the operation of these factors. But this knowledge is defective. We 
cannot exclude beforehand the possibility that we have erred in the 
appraisal of their influence or have failed to take into considcration 
some factors whose interference we did lot foresee at all, or not in a 
correct way. 

Gambling, engineering, and speculating are three different modes 
of dealing with the future. 

The gambler knows nothing ahout the cvcnt on which the out- 
come of his gambling depends. All that he knows is the frequency of 
a favorable outcome of a scries of such events, linoudedge which is 
useless for his undertaking. He trusts to good luck, that is his only 
plan. 

Life itself is exposed to many risks. At any moment it is endangered 
by disastrous accidents which cannot be controlled, or at least not 
sufficiently. Every man banks on good luck. He counts upon not 
being struck by li&tning and not being bitten by a viper. There is an 
elcmcnt of gambling in human life. Alan can remove some of the 
chrematistic conseqi~enccs of such disasters and accidents by taking 
out insurance policies. In doing so he banks upon the opposite chances. 
On the part of the insured the insurance is gambling. His premiums 
were spent in vain if the disaster does not occur." With regard to 
noncontrollable natural events man is always in the position of a 

---Ll,...

g'lIlIUIcI. 

The engineer, on the other hand, knows everything that is needed 
for a technologically satisfactory solution of his problem, the con- 
struction of a machine. As far as some fringes of uncertainty are left 
in his power to control, he tries to eliminate thern by taking safety 
margins. The engineer knows only soluble problems and problems 
which cannot be solved under the present state of knowledge. He 

2. In life insurance the insured's stake spent in vain consists only in the dif- 
ference between the amount collected and the amount he could haw accumulated 
by saving. 

Uncertainty "3 

may sometimes discover from adverse experience that his lmowledgc 
was less complete than he had assumed and that he failed to recognize 
the indeterminateness of some issues which he thought he was able 
to control. Then he will try to render his knowledge more complete. 
Of course he can never eliminate altogether the element of gambling 
present in human life. But it is his principle to operate only within 
an orbit of certainty. He aims at full control of the elements of his 
action. 

It is customary nowadays to speak of "social engineering." Like 
planning, this term is a synonym for dictatorship and totalitarian 
vrannv. The idea is to treat human beings in the same way in which 
the eniinecr treats the stuff out of which he builds his bridges, roads, 
and machines. The social engineer's will is to be substituted for the 
will of the various people he plans to use for the construction of his 
utopia. Mankind is to be divided into two classes: the almighty 
dictator, on the one hand, and the underlings who are to be reduced 
to the status of mere pawns in his plans and cogs in his machinery, 
on the other. If this were feasible, then of course the social engineer 
would not have to bother about understanding other people's actions. 
He would be free to deal with them as technology deals with lumber 
and iron. 

In the real world acting man is faced with the fact that there are 
feIlow men acting on their own behalf as he himself acts. The ncces- 
sity to adjust his actions to other people's actions makes him a specu- 
lator for whom success and failure depend on his greater or lesser 
ability to understand the future. Every investment is a form of 
speculation. There is in the course of human events no stability and 
consequently no safety. 

j. Nunlerical EvaIuation of Case Probability 
Case probability is not open to any kind of numerical evaluation. 

What is comrnonly considered as such exhibits, when more closely 

scrutinized, a different character. 

On the cve of the 1944 presidential election peopIe could have 

said: 

(a) I an1 ready to bet three dollars against one that Roosevelt will 
be elected. 
(b) I guess that out of the total amount of electors 4jmillions will 
exercise their franchise, 25 millions of whom will vote for Roosevelt. 
(c) I estimate Roosevelt's chances as 9 to I. 
(d) I am certain that Roosevelt will be elected. 

114 Human Action 

Statement (d) is obviously inexact. If asked under oath on the wit- 
ness stand whcther he is as certain about Roosevelt's future victory 
as about the fact that a block of ice will melt when exposed to a 
tempcrature of I jo degrees, our man would have answered no. He 
would have rcctified his statement and would have declared: I am 
personaliy fully convinced that Roosevelt will carry on. That is my 
opinion. But, of course, this is not certainty, only the way I under- 
stand the conditions involved. 

The case of statement (a) is simiIar. This man believed that he risked 
very littlc when laying such a wager. The relation 3: I docs not 
assert anything at~out the chances of the candidates. It is the out- 
come of the interplay of two factors: the opinion that Rooscvelt 
will be elected and the man's propensity for betting. 

Statement (b) is an evaluation of the outcome of the impending 
event. Its figures refer not to a greater or smaller degree of probability, 
but to the expectcd rcsult of the voting. Such a statcment may be 
based on a systematic investigation like the Gallup poll or simp& on 
estimates. 

It is different with statement (c). This is a proposition about the 
expected outcome couched in arithmetical terms. It certainly docs 
not mean that out of ten cases of the same type nine are favorable for 
Roosevelt and one unfavorable. It cannot have any refercnce to class 
probability. But what else can it mean? 

It is a metaphorical expression. Most of the metaphors used in daily 
speech imaginatively identify an abstract object with another object 
that can be apprehended directly by the senses. Yet this is not a ncccs- 
sary feature of metaphorical language, but merely a consequence of 
the fact that the concrete is as a rule more familiar to us than the 
abstract. As metaphors aim at an explanation of something which is 
less we11 known by comparing it with something better known, they 
consist for the most part in identifying something abstract with a 
better-known concrete. The specific mark of our case is that it is an 
attempt to chcidate a compfcated state of aeairs by rcsorcing co an 
analogy borrowed from a branch of higher mathematics, thc calcuIus 
of probability. As it happens, this mathematical discipline is more 
popular than the analysis of the epistcmological nature of understand- 
ing. 

Thcre is no use in applying the yardstick of logic to a critique of 
n~etaphorical language. Analogies and metaphors are always defec- 
tive and logically unsatisfactory. It is usual to search for the under- 
lying tertium co7nparationis. But even this is not permissible with 
regard to the metaphor we are dealing with. For the comparison is 


Uncertainty 115 

based on a conception which is in itself faulty in the very frame of 
the calculus of probability, namely the gambler's fallacy. In asserting 
that Roosevelt's chances are 9: I, the idea is that Roosevelt is in regard 
to the impending election in the position of a man who owns go per 
cent of all tickets of a lottery in regard to the first prize. It is implied 
that this ratio 9: I tells us something substantial about the outcome of 
the unique case in which we are interested. There is no need to re- 
peat th; this is a mistaken idea. 

No less impermissible is the recourse to thc calculus of probability 
in dealing with hypotheses in the field of the natural sciences. Hypoth- 
escs are tentative explanations consciously based on logically in- 
sufficient argurncnts. With regard to them all that can be asserted is: 
The hypothesis does or does not contradict either logical principles 
or the facts as experimentally established and considered as true. In 
the first case it is untenable, in the second case it is-under the present 
state of our experimental knowledge-not untenable. (The intensity 
of personal conviction is purely subjective.) Neither frequency prob- 
ability nor historical understanding enters into the matter. 

The term hypothesis, applied to definite modes of understanding 
historical events, is a misnomer. If a historian asserts that in the fall 
of the Romanoff dynasty the fact that this house was of German 
background played a relevant role, he does not advance a hypothesis. 
The facts on which his understanding is founded are beyond ques- 
tion. There was a widespread anin~osity against Germans in Russia 
and the ruling line of the Romanoffs, having for 200 years intermarried 
exclusivcIy with scions of families of German descent, was vicwed 
by many Russians as a germanized family, even by those who as- 
sumed that Tsar Paul was not the son of Peter 111. But the question 
rcrnains what the relevance of these facts was in the chain of events 
which brought about the dethronement of this dynasty. Such prob- 
lems are not open to any elucidation other than that provided by un- 
derstanding. 

6. Betting, Gambling, and Playing Games 
A bet is the engagement to risk money or other things against an- 
other man on the result of an event aboct the outcome of which we 
know only so much as can be known on the ground of understanding. 
Thus people may bet on the result of an impending election or a tennis 
match. Or they may bet on whose opinion concerning the content 
of a factual assertion is right and whose is wrong. 

Gambling is the engagement to risk money or other things against 


I 16 H7471zlzn Action 

another man on the result of an event about which we do not know 
anything more than is known on the ground of knowledge concern- 
ing the behavior of the whole class. 

Sometimes betting and gambling are combined. The outcome of 
horse racing depends both on human action-on the part of the 
owner of the horse, the trainer, and thc jockey-and on nonhuman 
factors-the qualities of the horse. Most of those risking money on 
the turf are simply gamblers. But the experts believe they know some- 
thing by understanding the people involved; as far as this factor 
influences their decision they are betters. Furthermore they pre- 
tend to know the horses; they make a prognosis on the grobnd of 
their ltnowledge about the behavior of the classes of horses to which 
they assign the various competing horses. So far they are gamblers. 

Later chapters of this book deal with the methods business applies 
in handling the problem of the uncertainty of the future. On this 
point of our reasoning only one more observation must be made. 

Embarking upon pmes can be either an end or a means. It is an 
end for people who yearn for the stimulation and excitement with 
which the vicissitudes of a game provide them, or whose vanity is 
flattered by the display of their skill and superiority in playing a 
game which requires cunning and expertness. It is a means for pro- 
fessionals who want to make money by winning. 

Playing a game can therefore be called an action. But it is not per- 
missible to reverse this statement and to call every action a game or 
to deal with all actions as if they were games. The immediate aim in 
playing a game is to defeat the partner according to the rules of the 
game. This is a peculiar and special case of acting. Most actions do not 
aim at anybody's defeat or loss. They aim at an improvement in con- 
ditions. It can happen that this improvement is attained at some other 
men's expense. But this is certainly not always the case. It is, to put 
it mildly, certainly not the case within the regular operation of a 
social system based on the division of labor. 

There Is n~t hctween playing games and the

the slightest ma!ogy 
conduct of business within a market society. The card player wins 
money by outsmarting his antagonist. The businessman makes money 
by supplying customers with goods they want to acquire. There may 
exist an analogy between the strategy of a card player and that of a 
bluffer. There is no need to investigate this problem. He who inter- 
prets the conduct of business as trickery is on the wrong path. 

The characteristic feature of games is the antagonism of two or more 
players or groups of play~rs.~ 

The characteristic feature of business

Uncertainty "7 

within a society, i.c., within an order based on the division of labor, is 
concord in the endeavors of its members. As soon as they begin to 
antagonize one another, a tendency toward social disintegration 
emerges. 

Within the frame of a market economy competition does not in- 
volve antagonism in the sense in which this term is applied to the 
hostile clash of incompatible interests. Competition, it is true, may 
sometimes or even very often evoke in the cornpctitors those passions 
of hatred and malice which usually accompany the intention of in- 
flicting evil on other people. Psychologists are therefore prone to 
confuse combat and competition. But praxeology must beware of 
such artificial and misleading equivocations. From its point of view 
there exists a fundamental difference between catallactic competition 
and combat. Competitors aim at excellence and preeminence in ac- 
complishments within a system of mutual cooperation. The function 
of competition is to assign to every member of a social system that 
position in which he can best serve the whole of society and all its 
members. It is a method of selecting the most able man for each 
performance. Where there is social cooperation, there some variety 
of selection must be applied. Only where the assignment of various 
individuals to various tasks is effected by the dictator's decisions 
alone and the individuals concerned do not aid the dictator by en- 
deavors to represent their own virtues and abilities in the most favor- 
able light, is there no competition. 

We will have to deal at a later stage of our investigations with 
the function of c~mpetition.~ 

At this point we must only emphasize 
that it is misleading to apply the terminology of mutual extermina- 
tion to the problems of mutual cooperation as it works within a so- 
ciety. Military terms are inappropriate for the dcscription of busi- 
ness operations. It is, e.g., a bad metaphor to spcak of the conquest 
of a market. There is no conquest in the fact that one firm offers bettcr 
or cheaper products than its competitors. There is strategy in busi- 
ness only in a metaphorical sense. 

7. PraxeologicaI Prediction 
Praxeological knowledge makes it possible to predict with apodictic 
certainty the outcome of various modes of action. But, of course,

of escaping boredom. It: certainly does not represent a pattern for what is goin:, 
on in a communistic society, as John von Neumann and Oscar Morgensterr 

(Theory of Games and Economic Behavior [Princeton, 19441, p. 86) assert. 

4. See below, pp. 273-277. 

I 18 Human Action 

such prediction can never imply anything regarding quantitative 
matters. Quantitative problems are in the field of human action open 
to no other elucidation than that by understanding. 

We can predict, as will be shown later, that-other things being 
equal-a fall in the demand for n will result in a drop in the price of 

n. But we cannot predict the extent of this drop. This question can 
be answered only by understanding. 
The fundamental deficiency implied in every quantitative ap- 
proach to economic problems consists in the neglect of the fact that 
there are no constant relations between what are called economic 
dimensions. There is neither constancy nor continuity in the valua- 
tions and in the formation of exchange ratios between various com- 
modities. Every new datum brings about a reshufling of the whole 
price structure. Understanding, by trying to grasp what is going on 
in the minds of the men concerned, can approach the problem of 
forecasting future conditions. We may call its method unsatisfactory 
and the positivists may arrogantly scorn it. But such arbitrary judg- 
ments must not and cannot obscure the fact that understanding is the 
only appropriate method of dealing with the uncertainty of future 
conditions. 


VII. ACTION WITHIN THE WORLD 
I. The Law of Marginal Utility 
CTION sorts and grades; originally it knows only ordinal numbers, Anot cardinal numbers. But the external world to which acting 
man must adjust his conduct is a world of quantitative determinate- 
ness. In this world there exist quantitative relations between cause and 
effect. If it were otherwise, if definite things could render unlimited 
services, such things would never be scarce and could not be dealt 
with as means. 

Acting man vaIues things as means for the removal of his uneasi- 
ness. From the point of view of the natural sciences the various events 
which result in satisfying human needs appear as very different. Act- 
ing man sees in these events only a more or a less of the same kind. In 
valuing very different states of satisfaction and the means for their 
attainment, man arranges all things in one scale and sees in them only 
their reIevance for an increase in his own satisfaction. The satis- 
faction derived from food and that derived from the enjoyment of 
a work of art are, in acting man's judgment, a more urgent or a less 
urgent need; valuation and action place them in one scale of what is 
more intensively desired and what is less. For acting man there exists 
primarily nothing but various degrees of relevance and urgency with 
regard to his own well-being. 

Quantity and quality are categories of the external world. Only 
indirectly do they acquire importance and meaning for action. ~d-
cause every thing can only produce a limited effect, some things are 
considered scarce and treated as means. Because the cfTecrs which 
things are able to produce are different, acting man distinguishes 
various classes of things. Because means of the same quantity and 
quality are apt always to produce the same quantity of an effect of 
the same quality, action does not differentiate between concrete def- 
inite quantities of homogeneous means. But this docs not imply that 
it attaches the same value to the various portions of a supply of 
homogeneous means. Each portion is valued separately. To each 
portion its own rank in the scale of value is assigned. But these orders 
of rank can be ad libitum interchanged among the various portions of 
the same magnitude. 


IZO Hzlman Action 

If acting man has to decide between two or more means of different 
classes, he grades the individual portions of each of them. He assigns 
to each portion its special rank. In doing so he need not assign to the 
various portions of the same means orders of rank which immediately 
succeed one another. 

The assignment of orders of rank through the valuation is done 
only in acting and through acting. How great the portions are to 
which a single order of rank is assigned depends on the individual and 
unique conditions under which man acts in every case. Action does 
not deal with physical or metaphysical units which it values in an 
abstract academic way; it is aIways faced with alternatives between 
which it chooses. The choice must always be made between definite 
quantities of means. It is permissible to call the smallest quantity 
which can be the object of such a decision a unit. But one must guard 
oneself against the error of assuming that the valuation of the sum of 
such units is derived from the valuation of the units, or that it repre- 
sents the sum of the valuations attached to these units. 

A man owns five units of commodity a and three units of cornmod- 
ity b. He attaches to the units of a the rank-orders I, 2, 4, 7, and 8, to 
the units of b the rank-orders 3, 5, and 6. This means: If he must 
choose between two units of a and two units of b, he will prefer to Iose 
two units of a rather than two units of b. But if he must choose be- 
tween three units of a and two units of b, he will prefer to lose two 
units of b rather than three units of a. What counts always and alone 
in valuing a compound of several units is the utility of this co~npound 
as a whole-i.e., the increment in well-being dependent upon it or, 
what is the same, the impairment of well-being which its loss must 
bring about. There are no arithmeticaI processes involved, neither 
adding nor multiplying; there is a valuation of the utility dependent 
upon the having of the portion, compound, or supply in question. 

Utility means in this context simpIy: causal relevance for the re- 
moval of feIt uneasiness. Acting man believes that the services a 
thing can render are apt to improve his own well-being, and calls 
this the utility of the thing concerned. For praxeology the term utility 
is tantamount to importance attached to a thing on account of the 
belief that it can remove uneasiness. The praxeological notion of utility 
(subjective use-value in the terminology of the earlier Austrian econ- 
omists) must be sharply distinguished from the technological notion 
of utility (objective use-value in the terminology of the same econ- 
omists). Use-value in the objective sense is the relation between a 
thing and the effect it has the capacity to bring about. It is to objec- 
tive use-value that people refer in employing such terms as the "heat- 


Action Within the World 

ing value" or "heating power" of coal. Subjective use-value is not 
always based on true objective use-value. There are things to which 
subjective use-value is attached because people erroneously believe 
that they have the power to bring about a desired effect. On the other 
hand there are things able to produce a desired effect to which no 
use-value is attached because people are ignorant of this fact. 

Let us look at the state of economic thought which prevailed on 
the eve of the elaboration of the modern theory of value by Carl 
Menger, William Stanley Jevons, and Lkon Walras. Whoever wants 
to construct an elementary theory of value and prices must first 
think of utility. Nothing indeed is more plausible than to assume that 
things are valued according to their utility. But then a difficulty ap- 
pears which presented to the older economists a problem they failed 
to solve. They observed that things whose "utility" is greater are 
valued less than other things of smaller utility. Iron is less appreciated 
than gold. This fact seems to be incompatible with a theory of value 
and prices based on the concepts of utility and use-value. The econ- 
omists believed that they had to abandon such a theory and tried to 
explain the phenomena of value and market exchange by other 
theories. 

Only late did the economists discover that the apparent paradox 
was the outcome of a vicious formulation of the problem involved. 
The valuations and choices that result in the exchange ratios of the 
market do not decide between gold and iron. Acting man is not in a 
position in which he must choose between all the gold and all the 
iron. He chooses at a definite time and place under definite conditions 
between a strictly limited quantity of gold and a strictly limited 
quantity of iron. His decision in choosing between IOO ounces of 
gold and IOO tons of iron does not depend at all on the decision he 
would make if he were in the highly improbable situation of choosing 
between all the gold and all the iron. What counts alone for his actual 
choice is whether under existing conditions he considers the direct or

greater or smaller than the direct or indirect satisfaction he could de- 
rive from IOO tons of iron. He does not express an academic or 
philosophical judgment concerning the "absolute" value of gold and 
of iron; he does not determine whether gold or iron is more im- 
portant for mankind; he does not perorate as an author of books on the 
philosophy of history or on ethical principles. He simply chooses be- 
tween two satisfactions both of which he cannot have together. 

To prefer and to set aside and the choices and decisions in which 
they result are not acts of measurement. Action does not measure 


Human Action 

utility or valuc; it chooses between alternatives. There is no abstract 
problem of total utility or total va1ue.l There is no ratiocinative oper- 
ation which could lead from the valuation of a definite quantity or 
number of things to the determination of the value of a greater or 
smaller quantity or number. There is no means of calculating the 
totaI value of a supply if only the values of its parts arc known. There 
is no means of establishing the value of a part of a supply if only the 
value of the total supply is known. There are in the sphere of values 
and valuations no arithmetical operations; there is no such thing as 
a calculation of values. The valuation of the total stock of two things 
can differ from the valuation of parts of these stocks. An isolated 
man owning seven cows and seven horses may value one horse higher 
than one cow and may, when faced with the alternativc, prefer to 
give up one cow rather than one horse. But at the same time the 
same man, when faced with the alternative of choosing between his 
whole supply of horses and his whole supply of cows, may prefer 
to keep the cows and to give up the horses. The concepts of total 
utility and total value are meaningless if not applied to a situation in 
which people must choose between total supplies. The question 
whether gold as such and iron as such is more useful and valuable 
is reasonable only with regard to a situation in which mankind or an 
isolated part of mankind must choose between all the gold and all the

-

iron avaiiable. 

The judgment of value refers always only to the supply with which 
the concrete act of ch0ice.i~ concerned. A supply is ex definitione 
always composed of homogeneous parts each of which is capable of 
rendering the same services as, and of being substituted for, any other 
part. It is therefore immaterial for the act of choosing which par- 
ticular part forms its object. All parts-units-of the available stock 
are considered as equally useful and valuable if the problem of giving 
up one of them is raised. If the supply decreased by the loss of one 
unit, actine man must decide anew how to use the various units of 

F'

the rcmainlng stock. It is obvious that the srnallcrstock cannot render 
all the services the greater stock could. That employment of the 
various units which under this new disposition is no longer provided 
for, was in the eyes of acting man the least urgent empIoyment among 
all those for which he had previously assigned the various units of 
the greater stock. The satisfaction which he derived from the use of 
one unit for this employment was the smallest among the satisfactions 

r. It is important to note that this chapter does not deal with prices or market 
vaIues, but with subjectivc use-vaIue. Prices are a derivative of subjective use- 
value. Cf. below, Chapter XVI. 

Action Within the World 

123 

which the units of the greater stock had rendered to him. It is only 
the value of this marginal satisfaction on which he must decide if the 
question of renouncing one unit of the total stock comes up. When 
faced with the problem of the value to be attached to one unit of a 
homogeneous supply, man decides on the basis of the value of the 
least important use he nlakes of the units of the whole supply; he 
decides on the basis of marginal utility. 

If a man is faced with the alternative of giving up either one unit 
of his supply of a or one unit of his supply of b, he does not compare 
the total value of his total stock of a with the total value of his stock 
of b. He compares the marginal values both of a and of b. Although 
he may value the total supply of a higher than the total supply of 
b, the marginal value of b may be higher than the marginal value of a. 

The same reasoning holds good for the question of increasing the 
available supply of any commodity by the acquisition of an additional 
definite number of units. 

For the description of these facts economics does not need to em- 
ploy the terminology of psychology. Neither does it need to resort 
to psychological reasoning and arguments for proving them. If we 
say that the acts of choice do not depend on the value attached to a 
whole class of wants, but on that attached to the concrete wants in 
question irrespective of the class in which thcy may be reckoncd, we 
do not add anything to our knowledge and do not trace it back to 
some better-known or more general knowledge. This mode of speak- 
ing in terms of classes of wants becomes intelligible only if we rernem. 
ber the role played in the history of economic thought by the alleged 
paradox of value. Carl Menger and B6hm-Bawerk had to make use 
of the term "class of wants7' in order to refute the objections raised 
by those who considered bread as such more valuabk than silk be-
cause the class "want of nourishment7' is more important than the 
class "want of luxurious clothing." Today the concept "class of 
wants" is entirely superfluous. It has no meaning for action and there- 
fore none for the theory of value; it is, moreover, liable to bring 
about error and confusion. Construction of concepts and classifica- 
tion are mental tools; they acquire meaning and sense only in the con- 
text of the theories which utilize them? It is nonsensical to arrange

3. Classes are not in the world. It is our mind that classifies the phenomena 
in order to organize our knowledge. The question of whether a certain mode 
of classifying phenomena is conducive to this end or not is different from the 
question of whether it is logically permissible or not. 

Hmnan Action 

various wants into "classes of wants" in order to establish that such 

a classification is of no avail whatever for the theory of value. 

The law of marginal utility and decreasing marginal value is inde- 

pendent of Gossen's law of the saturation of wants (first law of 

Gossen). In treating marginal utility we deal neither with sensuous 

enjoyment nor with saturation and satiety. We do not transcend the 

sphere of praxeological reasoning in establishing the following def- 

inition: We call that employment of a unit of a homogeneous supply 

which a man makes if his supply is n units, but would not make if, 

other things being equal, his supply were only n -I units, the 

least urgent employment or the marginal employment, and the 

utility derived from-it marginal utility. In order to attain this knowl- 

edge we do not need any physiological or psychological experience, 

knowledge, or reasoning. It follows necessarily from our assump-

tions that people act (choose) and that in the first case acting man has 

n units of a homogeneous supply and in the second case n -I units. 

Under these conditions no other result is thinkable. Our statement is 

formal and aprioristic and does not depend on any experience. 

There are only two alternatives. Either there are or there are not 
intermediate stages between the felt uneasiness which impels a man 
to act and the state in which there can no longer be any action (be it 
because the state of perfect satisfaction is reached or because man 
is incapable of any further improvement in his conditions). In the 
second case there 'could be only one action; as soon as this action is 
consummated, a state would be reached in which no further action is 
possible. This is manifestly incompatible with our assumption that 
there is action; this case no longer implies the general conditions pre- 
supposed in the category of action. Only the first case remains. But 
then there are various degrees in the asymptotic approach to the 
state in which there can no longer be any action. Thus the law of 
marginal utility is already implied in the category of action. It is 
nothing else than the rcverse of the statement that what satisfies more 
is to what gives smaller satisfaction. If the supply available 
increases from 72 -I units to n units, the increment can be employed 
only for the removal of a want which is less urgent or less painful 
than the least urgent or least painful among all those wants which 
could be removed by means of the supply rz -I. 

The law of marginal utility does not refer to objective use-value, 
but to subjective use-value. It does not deal with the physical or 
chemical capacity of things to bring about a definite effect in general, 
but with their relevance for the well-being of a man as he himself 
sees it under the prevailing momentary state of his affairs. It does not 


Action Within the World 

deal primarily with the value of things, but with the value of the 
services a man expects to get from them. 

If we were to beIieve that marginal utility is about things and 
their objective use-value, we would be forced to assume that marginal 
utility can as well increase as decrease with an increase in the quan- 
tity of units available. It can happen that the employment of a certain 
minimum quantity-rz units-of a good a can provide a satisfaction 
which is deemed more valuable than the services expected from one 
unit of a good b. Rut if the supply of a available is smaller than n, a 
can only be employed for another service which is considered less 
valuable than that of b. Then an increase in the quantity of a from 
n -I units to n units results in an increase of the value attached to 
one unit of n. The owner of loo logs may build a cabin which pro- 
tects him against rain better than a raincoat. But if fewer than 30 logs 
are available, he can only use them for a berth that protects him against 
the dampness of the soi1. As the owner of 95 logs he would be prepared 
to forsake the raincoat in order to get 5 logs more. As the owner of 
10 logs he would not abandon the raincoat even for 10 logs. A man 
whose savings amount to 3x00 may not be willing to carry out some 
work for a remuneration of $200. But if his savings were $2,000 and 
he were extremely anxious to acquire an indivisible good which can- 
not be bought for less than $z,ioo, he would be ready to perform 
this work for $100. All this is in perfect agreement with the rightly 
formulated law of marginal utility according to which value depends 
on the utility of the services expected. There is no question of any 
such thing as a law of increasing utility. 

The law of marginal utility must be confused neither with Ber- 
noulli's doctrine de mensura sortis nor with the Weber-Fechner law. 
At the bottom of Bernoulli's contribution were the generally known 
and never disputed facts that people are eager to satisfy the marc 
urgent wants before they satisfy the less urgent, and that a rich man 
is in a position to provide better for his wants than a poor man. But 
the inferences Bernoulli drew from these truisms are all wrong. He 
developed a mathematical theory that the increment in gratification 
diminishes with the increase in a man's total wealth. His statement that 
as a ruIe it is highly probable that for a man whose income is 5,000 
ducats one ducat means not more than half a ducat for a man with 
an income of 2,500 ducats is merely fanciful. Let us set aside the ob- 
jection that there is no incans of drawing comparisons other than en- 
tirely arbitrary ones between the valuations of various people. Ber- 
nouili's method is no less inadequate for the valuations of the same 
individual with various amounts of income. He did not see that all 


that can be said about the case in question is that with increasing in- 
come every new increment is used for the satisfaction of a want less 
urgently felt than the least urgently felt want already satisfied before 
this increment took place. He did not see that in valuing, choosing, 
and acting there is no measurement and no establishment of equiv- 
alence, but grading, i.e., preferring and putting aside.4 Thus neither 
Bernoulli nor the mathematicians and economists who adopted his 
mode of reasoning could succeed in solving the paradox of value. 

The mistakes inherent in the confusion of the Wcber-Fechner law 
of psychophysics and the subjective theory of value have already been 
attacked by Max WTeber. Max Weber, it is true, was not sufficiently 
familiar with economics and was too much under the sway of his- 
toricism to get a correct insight into the fundarncntals of economic 
thought. But ingenious intuition provided him with a suggestion of 
a way toward the correct solution. The theory of marginal utility, 
he asserts, is "not psychologically substantiated, but rather-if an 
cpisternological term is to be applied-pragmatically, i.e., on the 
employment of the categories: ends and means." 

If a man wants to remove a pathological condition by taking a def- 
inite quantity of a remedy, the intake of a multiple will not bring 
about a better effect. The surplus will have either no effect other than 
the appropriate dose, the optimum, or it will have detrimental effects. 
The same is true of all kinds of satisfactions, although the optimum 
is often reached onIy by the application of a large dose, and the point 
at which further increments produce detrimental effects is often far 
away. This is so because our world is a world of causality and of 
quantitative relations between cause and effect. Ile who wants to 
remove thc uneasiness caused by living in a room with a temperature 
of 35 degrees will aim at heating the room to a temperature of 65 or 
70 degrees. It has nothing to do with the Weber-Fechner law that he 
does not aim at a temperature of 180 or 300 degrees. Neither has it 
anything to do with psychology. A11 that psychology can do for the

liable to bring about confusion. It is inexpedient to employ it for anything 
other than the philosophy of Pragmatism. If Weber had known the term

he must and does choose, is-apart from other conditions-due to the 
fact that he lives in a quantitative world and not in a world without 
quantity, which is even unimaginable for the human mind. 

The confusion of marginal utility and the Weber-Fechner law 
originated from the mistake of looking only at the means for the 
attainment of satisfaction and not at the satisfaction itself. If the 
satisfaction had been thought of, the absurd idea would not have been 
adopted of explaining the configuration of the desire for warmth by 
referring to the decreasing intensity of the sensation of successive 
increments in the intensity of the stimuli. That the average man does 
not want to raise the temperature of his bedroom to 120 degrees has 
no refercnce whatever to the intensity of the sensation for warmth. 
That a man does not heat his room to the same degree as other normal 
people do and as he himself would probably do, if he were not more 
intent upon buying a new suit or attending the performance of a 
Beethoven symphony, cannot be explained by the methods of the 
natural sciences. Objective and open to a treatment by the methods 
of the natural sciences are only the problems of objective use-value; 
the valuation of objective use-value on the part of acting man is an- 
other thing. 

2. The Law of Returns 
Quantitative definiteness in the effects brought about by an eco- 
nomic good means with regard to the goods of the first order (con- 
sumers' goods): a quantity a of cause brings about-either in a def- 
inite period of time or at all-a quantity a of effect. With regard to the 
goods of the higher orders (producers' goods) it means: a quantity b 
of cause brings about a quantity /3 of effect, provided the comple- 
mentary cause c contributes the quantity y of effect; only the con- 
certed effects /3 and y bring about the quantity p of the good of the 
first order D.There are in this case three quantities: b and c of the 
two compIementary goods B and C, and p of the product D. 

Wich b remaining unchanged, we call that value of c which results 

P


in the highest value of --the optimum. If several values of c result in 

C 


this highest vaIue of -,P then we call that the optimum which results 

C 


also in the highest value of p. If the two complementary goods are 
employed in the optimal ratio, they both render the highest output; 
their power to produce, their objective use-value, is fully utilized; 
no fraction of them is wasted. If we deviate from this optimal com- 


I 28 Human Action 

bination by increasing the quantity of C without changing the quan- 
tity of B, the return will as a rule increase further, but not in pro- 
portion to the increase in the quantity of C. If it is at all possible to 
increase the return from p to pl by increasing the quantity of one 
of the complementary factors only, namely by substituting cx for 
c, x being greater than I, we have at any rate: pl ,p and p,c .PCX. 
For if it were possible to compensate any decrease in b by a cor- 
responding increase in c in such a way that p remains unchanged, the 
physical power of production proper to B would be unlimited and 
B would not be considered as scarce and as an economic good. It 
would be of no importance for acting man whether the supply of B 
available were greater or smaller. Even an infinitesimal quantity of 
R would be sufficient for the production of any quantity of D, pro-
vided the suppiy of C is large enough. On the other hand, an in- 
crease in the quantity of B available could not increase the output of 
D if the supply of C does not increase. The total return of the process 
would be imputed to C; B could not be an economic good. A thing 
rendering such unlimited services is, for instance, the knowledge of 
the causal relation implied. The formula, the recipe, that teaches us 
how to prepare coffee, provided it is known, renders unlimited 
services. It does not lose anything from its capacity to produce how- 
ever often it is used; its productive power is inexhaustible; it is there- 
fore not an economic good. Acting man is never faced with a situation 
in which he must choose between the use-value of a known formula 

and any other useful thing. 

The law of returns asserts that for the combination of economic 
goods of the higher orders (factors of production) there exists an 
optimum. If one deviates from this optimum by increasing the input 
of only one of the factors, the physical output either does not in- 
crease at all or at least not in the ratio of the increased input. This 
law, as has been demonstrated above, is implied in the fact that the 
quantitative definiteness of the effects brought about by any eco- 
nomic good is a necessary condition of its being an economic good. 

That there is such an optimum of combination is all that the law 
of returns, popularly called the law of diminishing returns, teaches. 
There are many other questions which it does not answer at all and 
which can only be solved a posteriori by experience. 

If the effect brought about by one of the compIementary factors 

is indivisible, the optimum is the only combination which results in 

the outcome aimed at. In order to dye a piece of wool to a definite 

shade, a definite quantity of dye is required. A greater or smaller 


Action Within the World 

quantity would frustrate the aim sought. He who has more coloring 
matter must leave the surplus unused. He who has a smaller quantity 
can dye only a part of the piece. The diminishing return results in 
this instance in the conlpletc uselessness of the additional quantity 
which must not even be employed because it would thwart the 
design. 

In other instances a certain minimum is required for the production 
of the minimum effect. Between this minimum effect and the optimal 
effect there is a margin in which increased doses result either in a pro- 
portional increase in effect or in a more than proportional increase 
in effect. In order to make a machine turn, a certain minimum of 
lubricant is needed. Whether an increase of lubricant above this mini- 
mum increases the machine's performance in proportion to thc in- 
crease in the amount applied, or to a greater extent, can only be 
ascertained by technological experience. 

The law of returns does not answer the foIlowing questions: (I) 
Whether or not the optimum dose is the only one that is capable of 
producing the efTect sought. (2) Whether or not there is a rigid 
limit above which any increase in the amount of the variable factor 
is quite useless. (3) Whether the decreasc in output brought about 
by progressive deviation from the optimum and the increase in out- 
put brought about by progressive approach to the optimum result in 
proportional or nonproportional changes in output per unit of the 
variable factor. All this must be discerned bv experience. But the law 
of returns itself, is., the fact that there mgst exist such an optimum 
combination, is valid a priori. 

The hlalthusian law of population and the concepts of absolute 
overpopulation and underpopulation and optimum population de- 
rived from it are the application of the law of returns to a special 
problem. They deal with changes in the supply of human labor, other 
factors being equal. Because people, for political considerations, 
wanted to reject the Malthusian law, they fought with passion but 
with iauity arguments against the law of returns-which, incidentaiiy, 
they knew only as the law of diminishing returns of the use of capital 
ad labor on land. Today we no longer need to pay any attention to 
these idle remonstrances. The Iaw of returns is not limited to the use 
of complementary factors of production on land. The endeavors to 
refute or to demonstrate its validity by historical and experimental 
investigations of agricultural production are needless as they are vain. 
He who wants to reject the law would have to explain why people are 
ready to pay prices for land. If the law were not valid, a farmer would 


Human Action 

never consider expanding the size of his farm. He would be in a posi- 
tion to multiply indefinitely the return of any piece of soil by muIti- 
plying his input of capital and labor. 

People have sometimes believed that, while the law of diminishing 
returns is valid in agricultural production, with regard to the process- 
ing industries a law of increasing returns prevails. It took a long time 
before they realized that the law of returns refers to all branches of 
production equally. It is faulty to contrast agriculture and the process- 
ing industries with regard to this law. What is called-in a very 
inexpedient, even misleading terminology-the law of increasing re- 
turns is nothing but a reversal of the law of diminishing returns, an 
unsatisfactory formulation of the law of returns. If one approaches 
the optimum combination by increasing the quantity of one factor 
only, the quantity of other factors remaining unchanged, then the 
returns per unit of the variable factor increase either in proportion 
to the increase or even to a greater extent. A machine may, when 
operated by 2 workers, produce p; when operated by 3 workers, 3 p; 
when operated by 4 workcrs, 6 p; when operated by 5 workers, 7 p; 
when operated by 6 workers, also not more than 7 p. Then the em- 
ployment of 4 workers rendcrs the optimum return per head of the 

worker, namely --
6 p, while under the other combinations the returns 

4 

per head are respectively 1/2 p, p, 7 p and 2p. If, instead of 2 workers,

5 6 
3 or 4 workers are employed, then the returns increase more than in 
relation to the increase in the number of workers; they do not increase 
in the proportion 2: 3:4, but in the proportion I: 3: 6. We are faced 
with increasing returns per head of the worker. 13ut this is nothing 
eke than the reverse of the law of diminishing returns. 
If a plant or enterprise deviates from the optimum combination of 
the factors employed, it is less efficient than a plant or ~nterprise 
for which the deviation from the optimum is smaller. Both in agri- 
culture and in the processing industries many factors of production 
are not perfectly divisible. It is, especially in the processing industries, 
for the most part easier to attain the optimum combination by ex- 
panding the size of the plant or enterprise than by restricting it. If 
the smallest unit of one or of several factors is too large to allow for 
its optimal exploitation in a small or medium-size plant or enter- 
prise, the only way to attain the optimum is by increasing the out- 
fit's size. It is these facts that bring about the superiority of big-scale 
production. The full importance of this problem wilI be shown later 
in discussing the issues of cost accounting.

3. Human Labor as a Means 
The employnlent of the physiological functions and manifestations 
of human life as a means is called labor. The display of the potentiali- 
ties of human energy and vital processes which the man whose life 
they manifest does not usc for the attainment of external ends dif- 
ferent from the mere running of these processes and from the physio- 
logical role they play in the biological consurnmation of his own 
vital economy, is not labor; it is simply life. Man works in using his 
forces and abilities as means for the removal of uneasiness and in 
substituting purposeful exploitation of his vital energy for the spon- 
taneous and carefree discharge of his faculties and nerve tensions. 
Labor is a means, not an end in itself. 

Every individual has only a limited quantity of energy to expend, 
and every unit of labor can only bring about a limited effect. Other- 
wise human labor would be available in abundance; it would not be 
scarce and it would not be considered as a means for the removal of 
uneasiness and economized as such. 

In a world in which labor is economized only on account of its be-
ing available in a quantity insufficient to attain all ends for which it 
can be used as a means, the supply of labor available would be equal 
to the whole quantity of labor which all men together are able to 
expend. In such a world everybody would be eager to work until he 
had completely exhausted his momentary capacity to work. The time 
which is not required for recreation an2 restoration of the capacity 
to work, used up by previous working, would be entirely devoted 
to work. Every nonutilization of the full capacity to work would be 
deemed a loss. Through the performance of more work one would 
have increased one's well-being. That a part of the available potential 
remained unused would be appraised as a forfeiture of well-being not 
compensated by any corresponding increase in well-being. The very 
idea of laziness would be unknown. Nobody would think: I could 
possibly do this or that; but it is not worth while; it does not pay; I 
prefer my leisure. Everybody would consider his whole capacity to 
work as a supply of factors of production which he would be anxious 
to utilize completely. Even a chance of the smallest increase in well- 
being would bc considered a sufficient incentive to work more if it 
happened that at the instant no more profitable use could be made of 
the quantity of labor concerned. 

In our actual world things are different. The expenditure of labor 
is deemed painful. hTot to work is considered a state of affairs more 
satisfactory than working. Leisure is, other things being equal, pre- 


Human Action 
ferred to travail. People work only when they value the return of 
labor higher than the decrease in satisfaction brought about by the 
curtailment of leisure. To work involves disutility. 
Psychology and physiology may try to explain this fact. There 
is no need for praxeology to invcstigke whcther or not they can 
succeed in such endeavors. For praxeology it is a datum that men are 
eager to enjoy leisure and therefore look upon their own capacity 
to bring about effects with feelings different from those with which 
they look upon the capacity of material factors of production. Man 
in considering an expenditure of his own labor investigates not only 
whether there is no more desirable end for the employment of the 
quantity of labor in question, but no less whcther it would not be 
more desirahlc to abstain from any further expenditure of labor. 
We can express this fact also in calling the attainment of leisure an 
end of purposeful activity, or an economic good of the first order. 
In employing this somewhat sophisticated terminology, we must view 
leisure as any other economic good from the aspeGt of marginal util- 
ity. We must conclude that the first unit of leisure satisfies a desire 
more urgently felt than the sccond one, the second one a more urgent 
desire than thc third one, and so on. Reversing this proposition, we 
get the statement that the disutility of labor felt by the worker in- 
creases in a greater proportion than the amount of labor expended. 
However, it is needless for praxeology to study the question of 
whether or not the disutility of labor increases in proportion to the 
increase in the quantity of labor performed or to a greater extent. 
(Whether this problem is of any importance for physiology and 
psychology, and whether or not these sciences can elucidate it, can 
be left undecided.) At any rate the worker knocks off work at the 
point at which he no longcr considers the utility of continuing work 
as a sufficient compensation for the disutility of the additional ex- 
penditure of labor. In forming this judgment he contrasts, if we 
disregard the decrease in yield brought about by increasing fatigue, 
same mianritv Of

each por:i::E of wOrkixg tiEe tt.icE, cI.,~ 1-."" "'J nrnanrt 2s

rL-----


the preceding portions. But the utility of the units of yield decreases 
with the progress of the labor performed and the increase in the 
total amount of yield produced. The products of the prior units of 
working time have provided for the satisfaction of more important 
needs than the products of the work performed later. The satis- 
faction of these less important needs may not be considered as a 
sufficient reward for the further continuation of work, although they 
are compared with the same quantities of physical output. 

It is therefore irreIevant for the praxeological treatment of the 


Action Within the World I33 

matter whether the disutility of labor is proportional to the total 
expenditure of labor or whether it increases to a greater extent than 
the time spent in working. At any rate, the propensity to expend the 
still unused portions of the total potential for work decreases, other 
things being equal, with the increase in the portions already ex-
pended. Whethcr this decrease in the readiness to work more proceeds 
with a more rapid or a less rapid acceleration, is always a question of 
economic data, not a question of categorial principles. 

The disutility attached to labor explains why in the course of 
human history, concomitantly with the progressive increase in the 
physical productivity of labor brought about by technological im- 
provement and a more abundant supply of capital, by and large a 
tendency toward shortening the hours of work developed. Among 
the amenities which civilized man can enjoy in a more abundant way 
than his less civilized ancestors there is also the enjoyment of more 
leisure time. In this sense one can answer the question, often raised 
by philosophcrs and philanthropists, whether or not economic prog- 
ress has made men happier. If the productivity of labor were lower 
than it is in the present capitalist world, man would be forced either 
to toil more or to forsake many amenities. In establishing this fact 
the economists do not assert that the only means to attain happiness 
is to enjoy more material comfort, to live in Iuxnry, or to have more 
leisure. They simply acknowledge the truth that men are in a posi- 
tion to provide themselves better with what they consider they 
need. 

The fundamental praxeological insight that men prefer what satis- 
fies them more to what satisfies them less and that they value things 
on the basis of their utility does not need to be corrected or comple- 
mented by an additional statement concerning the disutility of labor. 
Thcse propositions already imply the statement that labor is preferred 
to leisure only in so far as the yield of labor is more urgently desired 
than the enjoyment of leisure. 

The unique position which the factor labor occupies in our 
world is due to its nonspecific character. All nature-given primary 
factors of production-is., all those natural things and forces that 
man can use for improving his state of well-being-have specific 
powers and virtues. There are ends for whose attainment they are 
more suitable, ends for which they arc less suitable, and ends for 
which they are altogether unsuitable. But human labor is both suit- 
able and indispensable for the performance of all thinkable processes 
and modes of production. 

It is, of course, impermissible to deal with human labor as such in 


Human Action 

general. It is a fundamental mistake not to see that men and their 
abilities to work are different. The work a certain individual can 
perform is more suitable for some ends, less suitable for other ends, 
and altogether unsuitable for still other ends. It was one of the de- 
ficiencies of classical economics that it did not pay enough attention 
to this fact and did not take it into account in the construction of 
its theory of value, prices, and wage rates. Men do not economize 
labor in general, but the particular kinds of labor available. Wages 
are not paid for labor expended, but for the achievements of labor, 
which differ widely in quality and quantity. The production of each 
particular product requires the employment of workers able to per- 
form the particular kind of labor concerned. It is absurd to justify 
the failure to consider this point by reference to the alleged fact 
that the main demand for and supply of labor concerns unskilled 
common labor which evcry healthy man is able to perform, and that 
skilled labor, the labor of people with particular inborn faculties 
and special training, is by and large an exception. There is no need 
to investigate whether conditions were such in a remote past or 
whether even for primitive tribesmen the inequality of inborn and 
acquired capacities for work was the main factor in economizing 
labor. In dealing with conditions of civiIized peoples it is impermis- 
sible to disregard the differences in the quality of labor performed. 
Work which various people are able to perform is different be- 
cause men are born unequal and because the skill and experience 
they acquire in the course of their lives differentiate their capacities 
still more. 

In speaking of the nonspecific character of human labor we cer- 
tainly do not assert that all human labor is of the same quality. What 
we want to establish is rather that the differences in the kind of labor 
required for the production of various commodities are greater than 
the differences in the inborn capacities of men. (In emphasizing this 
point we are not dealing with the creative performances of the genius; 
the work of the genius is outside the orbit of ordinary human action 
and is like a free gift of destiny which comes to mankind o~ernight.~ 
We furthermore disregard the institutional barriers denying some 
groups of people access to certain occupations and the training they 
require.) The innate inequality of various individuals does not break 
up the zoologicaf uniformity and homogeneity of the species man 
to such an extent as to divide the supply of labor into disconnected 
sections. Thus the potential supply of labor available for the per- 
formance of each particular kind of work exceeds the actuaI demand 

6. See below, pp. 138-140. 

Action Within the TVodd 

for such labor. The supply of every kind of specialized labor could 
be increased by the withdrawal of workers from other branches and 
their training. The quantity of need satisfaction is in none of the 
branches of production permanently limited by a scarcity of people 
capable of performing special tasks. Only in the short run can there 
emerge a dearth of specialists. In the long run it can be removed by 
training people who display the innate abilities required. 

Labor is the most scarce of all primary mans of production be- 
cause it is in this restricted sense nonspecific and because every variety 
of production requires the expenditure of labor. Thus the scarcity of 
the other primary means. of production-i.e., the nonhuman means 
of production supplied by nature-becomes for acting man a scarcity 
of those primary material means of production whose utilization re- 
quires the smallest expenditure of labor.' It is the supply of labor 
available that determines to what an extent the factor nature in each 
of its varieties can be exploited for the satisfaction of needs. 

If the supply of labor which men are able and ready to perform 
increases, production increases too. Labor cannot remain unemployed 
on account of its being useless for the further improvement of need 
satisfaction. Isolated self-sufficient man always has the opportunity 
of improving his condition by expending more labor. On the labor 
market of a market society there are buyers for every supply of 
labor offered. There can be abundance and superfluity only in seg- 
ments of the labor market; it results in pushing labor to other segments 
and in an expansion of production in some other provinces of the 
economic system. On the other hand, an increase in the quantity of 
land available-other things being equal-could result in an incrcase 
in production only if the additional land is more fertile than the 
marginal land tilled before.* The same is valid with regard to ac- 
cumulated material equipment for future production. The service- 
ableness of capital goods also depends on the supply of labor avail- 
able. It would be wasteful to use the capacity of existing facilities 
if the labor required could be employed for the satisfaction of more 
urgent needs. 

Complementary factors of production can only be used to the ex- 
tent allowed by the availability of the most scarce among them. Let 
us assume that the production of I unit of p requires the expenditure 
of 7 units of a and of 3 units of b and that neither a nor b can be used 

7. Of course. some natural resources are so scarce that thev are entirelv 
utilized. 
8. Under free mobility of labor it would be waste to improve barren soil if 
the reclaimed area is not so fertile that it compensates for the total cost of the 
operation. 

Human Action 

for any production other than that of p. If 49 a and 2,000 b are avail- 
able, no more than 7 p can be produced. The available supply of a 
determines the extent of the use of b. Only a is considered an eco- 
nomic good; only for a are people ready to pay prices; the fulI price 
of p is allowed for 7 units of a. On the other hand b is not an economic 
good and no prices are allowed for it. There are quantities of b which 
remain unused. 

We may try to imagine the conditions within a world in which all 
material factors of production are so fully employed that there is no 
opportunity to employ all men or to employ all men to the extent that 
they are ready to work. In such a world labor is abundant; an in- 
crease in the supply of labor cannot add any increment whatever to 
the total amount of prod~~ction. 

If we assume that a11 men have the 
same capacity and application for work and if we disregard the disutil- 
ity of labor, labor in such a urorId would not be an economic good. 
If this world were a socialist commonwealth, an increase in population 
figures would be deemed an increase in the number of idle consumers. 
If it were a market society, wage rates paid would not be enough to 
prevent starvation. Those seeking employment would be ready to 
go to work for any wages, however low, even if insufficient for the 
preservation of their lives. They mould be happy to delay for a while 
death by starvation. 

There is no need to dwell upon the paradoxes of this hypothesis and 
to discuss the problems of such a world. Our world is different. Labor 
is more scarce than material factors of production. We are not deal- 
ing at this point with the problcrn of optimum population. We are 
dealing only with the fact that there are material factors of produc- 
tion which remain unused because the labor required is needed for 
the satisfaction of more urgent needs. In our world there is no abun- 
dance, but a shortage of manpower, and there are unused material 
factors of production, i.e., land, mineral deposits, and even plants and 
equipment. 

This state of affairs could be changed by such an increase in popula- 
tion figures that all material factors required for the production of 
the foodstuffs indispensable-in the strict meaning of the word-for 
the preservation of human life are fully exploited. But as long as this 
is not the case, it cannot be changed by any improvement in techno- 
logical methods of production. The substitution of more efficient 
methods of production for less efficient ones does not render labor 
abundant, provided there are still material factors available whose util- 
ization can increase human well-being. On the contrary, it increases 
output and thereby the quantity of consumers' goods. "Labor-saving" 


Action Within the World 

devices reduce want. They do not bring about "technological unem- 
ployment." 
Every product is the result of the enlployment both of labor and of 
material factors. Man economizes both labor and material factors. 

Immediately Gratifying Labor and Mediately Gratifying Labor 

As a rule labor gratifies the performer only mediately, namely, through 
the removal of uneasiness which the attainment of the end brings about. 
The worker gives up leisure and submits to thc disutility of labor in order 
to enjoy either the product or what other people arc ready to give him 
for it. The expenditure of labor is for him a means for the attainment of 
certain cnds, a price paid and a cost incurred. 

But there are instances in which the performance of labor gratifies the 
worker immediately. He derives immediate satisfaction from thc expcndi- 
ture of labor. The yield is twofold. It consists on the one hand in the at- 
tainment of the product and on the other hand in the satisfaction that the 
performance itself gives to the worltcr. 

People have misinterpreted this fact grotesquely and have based on this 
misinterpretation fantastic plans for social reforms. One of the main dog- 
mas of socialism is that labor has disutility only within thc capitalist system 
of production, while under socialism it will be pure delight. We may dis- 
regard the effusions of the poor lunatic Charles Fourier. But Marxian 
"scientific" socialism does not differ in this point from thc utopians. One 
of its foremost champions, Karl Kautsky, expressly declares that a chief 
task of a proletarian regime will be to transform labor from a pain into a 
pleasure." 

The fact is often ignored that those activities which bring about immedi- 
ate gratification and are thus direct sources of pleasure and enjoyment, 
are essentially different from labor and working. Only a very super- 
ficial treatment of the facts concerned can fail to recognize these differ- 
ences. Paddling a canoc as it is practiced on Sundays for amusement on the 
lakes of public parks can only from the point of view of hydromechanics 
be likened to the rowing of boatsmen and galley slaves. When judged as a 
means for the attainment of ends it is as different as is the humming of an 
aria by a rambler from the recital of the same aria by the singer in the 
opera. The carefree Sunday paddler and the singing rambler derive im- 
mediate gratification from their activities, but no mediate gratification. 
What they do is therefore not labor, not the employment of their physio- 
logical functions for the attainment of ends other than the mere exercise 
of these functions. It is merely pleasure. It is an end in itself; it is done for 
its own sake and does not render any further service. As it is not labor, it 
is not permissible to call it immediately gratifying labor.1°

Human Action 

Sometimes a superficial observer may believe that labor performed by 
other people gives rise to immediate gratification because he himself 
would like to engage in a kind of play which apparently imitates the kind 
of labor concerned. As children play schooI, soldiers, and railroad, so 
adults too would like to play this and that. They think that the railroad 
engineer must enjoy operating and steering his engine as much as they 
would if they were permitted to toy with it. On his hurried way to office 
the bookkeeper envies the patrolman who, hc thinks, is paid for leisurely 
strolling around his beat. BLI~ the patrohan envies the bookkeeper who, 
sitting on a con~fortable chair in a well-heated room, makes money by some 
scribbling which cannot seriously be called labor. Yet the opinions of 
people who misinterpret other people's work and consider it a mere pas- 
time need not be taken seriously. 

Thcre are, however, also instances of genuine immediately gratifying 
labor. There are some kinds of labor of which, under special conditions, 
small quantities provide immediate gratification. But these quantities are so 
insignificant that they do not play any role at all in the complex of human 
action and production for the satisfaction of wants. Our world is char- 
acterized by the phenomenon of the disutility of labor. People trade the 
disutility-bringing labor for the products of labor; labor is for them a 
source of mediate gratification. 

If a special kind of labor gives pleasure and not pain, immediate gratifica- 
tion and not disutility of labor, no wages are allowed for its performance. 
On the contrary, the performer, the 'korker," must buy the pleasure and 
pay for it. Hunting game was and is for many people regular disutility- 
creating labor. But there are people for whom it is pure pleasure. In Europe 
amateur hunters buy from the owner of the hunting-ground the right to 
shoot a definite number of game of a definite typc. The purchase of this 
right is scparated from the price to bc paid for the bag. If the two pur- 
chases are linked together, the price by far exceeds the prices that can be 
obtained on the market for the bag. A chamois buck still roaming on the 
precipitous rocks has therefore a higher cash value than later when killed, 
brought down to the valley, and ready for the utilization of the meat, the 
skin, and the horns, although strenuous climbing and some material must 
be expended for its killing. One could say that one of the services which a 
living buck is able to render is to provide the hunter with the pleasure of 
killing it. 

The Creative Genius 

Far above the millions that come and pass away tower the pioneers, the 
men whose deeds and ideas cut out new paths for mankind. For the 
pioneering genius to create is the essence of life. To live means for him 
to create. 

11. Leaders (F~hrers) are not ioneers. They guide people along the tracks 
pioneers have laid. The pioneer c I)ears a road through Iand hitherto inaccessible 

Action Within the World 

The activities of these prodigious men cannot be fully subsumed under 
the praxeological concept of labor. They are not labor because they are for 
the genius not means, but ends in themselves. He lives in creating and in- 
venting. For him there is no leisure, only intermissions of temporary 
sterility and frustration. His incentive is not the desire to bring about a 
result, but the act of producing it. The accomplishment gratifies him 
neither mediately nor immediately. It does not gratify him mediately be- 
cause his fellow men at best are unconcerned about it, more often even 
greet it with taunts, sneers, and persecution. Many a genius could have 
used his gifts to render his life agreeable and joyful; he did not even con- 
sider such a possibility and chose the thorny path without hesitation. The 
genius wants to accomplish what he considers his ~nission, even if he knows 
that he moves toward his own disaster. 

Neither does the genius derive immediate gratification from his creative 
activities. Creating is for him agony and torment, a ceaseless excruciating 
struggle against internal and external obstacles; it consumes and crushes 
him. The Austrian poet GriIlparzer has depicted this in a touching poem 
"Farewell to Gastein." l2We may assume that in writing it he thought not 
only of his own sorrows and tribulations but also of the greater sufferings 
of a much greater man, of Beethoven, whose fate resembled his own and 
whom he understood, through devoted affection and sympathetic ap- 
preciation, better than any other of his contemporaries. Kietzsche com- 
pared himself to the flame that insatiably consumes and destroys itself.'" 
Such agonies are phenomena which have nothing in common with the 
connotations generally attached to the notions of work and labor, produc- 
tion and success, breadwinning and enjoyment of life. 

The achievements of the creative innovator, his thoughts and theories, 
his poems, paintings, and compositions, cannot be classified praxeologically 
as products of labor. They are not the outcome of the employment of 
labor which could have been devoted to the production of other amenities 
for the "production" of a masterpiece of philosophy, art, or literature. 
Thinkers, poets, and artists are sometimes unfit to accomplish any other 
work. At any rate, the time and toil which they devote to creative activities 
are not withheld from empioyment for other purposes. Conditions may 
someti~nesdoom to sterility a man who would have had the power to bring

die from starvation or to use all his forces in the struggle for mere physical 
survival. But if the genius succeeds in achieving his goals, nobody but him- 
self pays the "costs" incurred. Goethe was perhaps in some respects ham- 

and may not care whether or not anybody wants to go the new way. The leader 
directs ~eople toward the goal they want to reach.

pered by his functions at the court of Weimar. But certainly he would not 
have accomplished more in his official duties as minister of state, theatre 
manager, and administrator of mines if he had not written his plays, poems, 
and novels. 
It is, furthermore, impossible to substitute other people's work for that 
of the creators. If Dante and Beethoven had not existed, one would not 
have been in a position to produce the Divina Corwwzedia or the Ninth 
Symphony by assigning other men to these tasks. hTeither society nor 
single individuals can substantially further the genius and his work. The 
highest intensity of the "dcmand" and the most peremptory order of the 
government are incfiectual. The genius does not deliver to order. ,Men 
cannot improve the natural and social conditions which bring about the 
creator and his creation, It is impossible to rear geniuses by eugenics, to 
train them by schooling, or to organize their activities. But, of course, one 
can organize society in such a way that no room is left for pioneers and 
their path-breaking. 
The creative accomplishment of the genius is an ultimate fact for praxe- 
ology. It comes to pass in history as a free gift of destiny. It is by no means 
the result of production in the sense in which economics uses this term. 

4. Production 
Action, if successful, attains the end sought. It produces the product. 

Production is not an act of creation; it does not bring about some- 
thing that did not exist before. It is a transformation of given ele- 
ments through arrangement and combination. The producer is not a 
creator. Alan is creative only in thinking and in the realm of imagina- 
tion. In the world of external phenomena he is only a transformer. 
All that he can accomplish is to combine the means available in such 
a way that according to the laws of nature the result aimed at is bound 
to emerge. 

It was once customary to distinguish between the production of 
tangible goods and the rendering of personal services. The carpenter 
who made tables and chairs was called productive; but this epithet 

.....v\ a2 dLluLu +-

p 

-..:,-.a rv the doctor whose advice heJpei: the ding carpeilter to 

recover his capacity to make tables and chairs. A differentiation was 
made between the doctor-carpenter nexus and the carpenter-tailor 
nexus. The doctor, it was asserted, does not himself produce; he makes 
a living from what other people produce, he is maintained by car-
penters and tailors. At a still earlier date the French ~h~siocrais 

con-
tended that all labor was sterile unless it extracted something from 
the soil. Only cultivation, fishing and hunting, and the working of 
mines and quarries were in their opinion productive. The processing 
industries did not add to the value of the materia1 employed any- 


Action Within the World 

141 

thing more than the value of the things consumed by the workers. 

Present-day economists laugh at their predecessors for having ~nade 
such untenable distinctions. However, they should rather cast the 
beam out of their own eyes. The way in which many contemporary 
writers deal with various problems-for instance, advertising and 
marlteting-is manifestly a relapse into the crude errors which should 
have disappeared long ago. 

Another widely held opinion finds a difference between the em- 
ployment of labor and that of material factors of production. Nature, 
it is asserted, dispenses its gifts gratuitously; but labor must be paid 
for by submitting to its disutility. In toiling and overcoming the 
disutility of labor man adds something to the universe that did not 
exist before. In this sense labor is creative. This too is erroneous. Man's 
capacity to work is given in the univcrse as are the original and in- 
herent capacities of the land and the animal substances. Nor does the 
fact that a part of the potcntiaIity of labor can remain unused dif- 
ferentiate it from the nonhvman factors of production; these too can 
rernain unused. The readiness of individuals to overcome the dis- 
utility of labor is the outcome of the fact that they prefer the produce 
of labor to the satisfaction derived from more leisure. 

Only the human ~nind that directs action and production is creative. 
The mind too appertains to the universe and to nature; it is a part 
of the given and existing world. To call the mind creative is not to 
indulge in any metaphysical speculations. We call it creative be- 
cause wc are at a loss to trace the changes brought about by human 
action farther back than to the point at which we arc faced with the 
intervention of reason directing human activities. Production is not 
something physical, natural, and external; it is a spiritual and intel- 
lectual phenomenon. Its essential requisites are not human labor and 
external naturaI forces and things, but the decision of the mind to use 
these factors as means for thc attainment of ends. What produces the 
product is not toil and trouble in themsclvcs, but the fact that the 
toilers are guided by reason. The human mind aIonc has the power to 
remove uneasiness. 

The materialist metaphysics of the Marxians misconstrues these 
things entirely. The "productive forces" are not material. Production 
is a spiritual, intellectual, and ideological phenomenon. It is the 
mcthod that man, directed by reason, employs for the best possible 
removal of uneasiness. What distinguishes our conditions from those 
of our ancestors who lived one thousand or twenty thousand years 
ago is not something material, but something spiritual. The material 
changes are thc outcome of the spiritual changes. 


Human Action 

Production is alteration of the given according to the designs of 
reason. These designs-the recipes, the formulas, the ideologies-are 
the primary thing; they transform the original factors-both human 
and nonhuman-into means. Man produces by dint of his reason; he 
chooses ends and employs means for their attainment. The popular 
saying according to which economics deals with the material condi- 
tions of human life is entirely mistaken. Human action is a manifesta- 
tion of the mind. In this sense praxeology can be called a moral science 

(Geisteswissenschaft). 

Of course, we do not know what mind is, just as we do not know 
what motion, life, electricity are. Mind is simply the word to signify 
the unknown factor that has enabled men to achieve all that they 
have accomplished: the theories and the poems, the cathedrals and 
the symphonies, the motorcars and the airplanes. 


Part Two 

Action Within the Framework of Society 

VIII. HUMAN SOCIETY 
I. Human Cooperation 
.TYis concerted action, cooperation. 
Soc;ciety is the outcome of conscious and purposeful behavior. 
This does not mean that individuals have concluded contracts by 
virtue of which they have founded human society. The actions which 
have brought about social cooperation and daily bring it about anew 
do not aim at anything else than cooperation and coadjuvancy with 
others for the attainment of definite singular ends. The total complex 
of the mutual relations created by such concerted actions is called 
society. It substitutes collaboration for the-at least conceivable- 
isolated life of individuals. Society is division of labor and combina- 
tion of labbr. In his capacity as an acting animal man becomes a 
social animal. 

Individual man is born into a socially organized environment. In 
this sense alone we may accept the saying that society is-logically 
or historicalIy-antecedent to the individual. In every other sense 
this dictum is either empty or nonsensical. The individual lives and 
acts within society. But society is nothing but the combination of 
individuals for cooperative effort. It exists nowhere else than in the 
actions of individual men. It is a delusion to search for it outside the 
actions of individuals. To speak of a society's autonomous and inde- 
pendent existence, of its life, its soul, and its actions is a metaphor 
which can easily lead to crass errors. 

The questions whether society or the individual is to be considered 
as the uitimate end, and whether the interests of society should be 
subordinated to those of the individuals or the interests of the individ- 
uals to those of society are fruitless. Action is always action of in- 
dividual men. The social or societal element is a certain orientation 
of the actions of individual men. The category end makes sense only 
when applied to action. Theology and the metaphysics of history 
may discuss the ends of society and the designs which God wants to 
realize with regard to society in the same way in which they discuss 
the purpose of all other parts of the created universe. For science, 
which is inseparable from reason, a tool manifestly unfit for the 


'44 Human Action 

treatment of such problems, it would be hopeless to embark upon 
speculations concerning these matters. 

Within the frame of social cooperation there can emerge between 
members of society feelings of sympathy and friendship and a sense 
of belonging together. These feelings arc the source of man's most 
delightful and most sublime experiences. They are the most precious 
adornment of life; they lift the animal species man to the heights of 
a really human existence. However, they are not, as some have as- 
serted, the agcnts that have brought about social relationships. They 
are fruits of social cooperation, they thrive only within its frame; 
they did not precede the establishment of social relations and are not 
the seed from which they spring. 

The fundamental facts that brought about cooperation, society, 
and civilization and transformed the animal man into a human being 
are the facts that work performed under the division of labor is more 
productive than isolated work and that man's reason is capable of 
recognizing this truth. Rut for these facts men would have forever 
remained deadly foes of one another, irreconcilable rivals in their 
endeavors to secure a portion of the scarce supply of means of sus- 
tenance provided by nature. Each man would have been forced to 
view all othcr inen as his enemies; his craving for the satisfaction of 
his own appetites would have brought him into an implacable con- 
flict with all his neighbors. No sympathy could possibly develop under 
such a state of affairs. 

Some sociologists have asserted that the original and elementary 

subjective fact in society is a "consciousness of kind." Others main- 

tain that there would be no social systems if there were no "sense of 

communi~yor of belonging together." " One may agree, provided that 

these somcwhat vague and ambiguous terms are correctly inter- 

preted. We may call consciousness of kind, sense of community, or 

sense of belonging together the acknowledgment of the fact that all 

other human beings are potential collaborators in the struggle for 

survival because they are capabie of recognizing the mutuai benefits 

of cooperation, while the animals lack this faculty. However, we 

must not forget that the primary facts that bring about such con- 

sciousness or such a sense are the two mentioned above. In a hppo- 

thetical world in which the division of labor would not increase 

productivity, there would not be any society. There would not be 

any sentiments of benevolence and good will. 

The principle of the division of Iabor is one of the great basic prin-

Human Society I45 

ciples of cosmic becoming and evolutionary change. The biologists 
were right in borrowing the concept of the division of labor from 
social philosophy and in adapting it to their field of investigation. 
There is division of labor between the various parts of any living 
organism. There are, furthermore, organic entities composed of col- 
laborating animal individuals; it is customary to call metaphorically 
such aggregations of the ants and bees "animal societies." But one 
must never forget that the characteristic feature of human society is 
purposeful cooperation; society is an outcome of human action, i.e., 
of a conscious aiming at the attainment of ends. No such clement is 
present, as far as we can ascertain, in the processes which have re- 
sulted in the emergence of the structure-function systems of plant 
and animal bodies and in the operation of thc societies of ants, bees, 
and hornets. Human society is an intellectual and spiritual phenome- 
non. It is the outcome of a purposeful utilization of a universal law 
determining cosmic becoming, viz., the higher productivity of the 
division of labor. As with every instance of action, the recognition of 
the laws of nature is put into the service of man's efforts to improve 
his conditions. 

2. A Critique of the Holistic and MetaphysicaI 
View of Society 
According to the doctrines of universalism, conceptual realism, 
holism, collectivism, and some representatives of Gestaltp~ychologie~ 
society is an entity living its own life, independent of and separate 
from the lives of the various individuals, acting on its own behalf and 
aiming at its own ends which are different from the ends sought by 
the individuals. Then, of course, an antagonism between the aims of 
society and those of its members can emerge. In order to safeguard 
the flowering and further developmcnt of society it becomes neces- 
sary to master the selfishness of the individuals anb to compel them to 
sacrifice their ~rrnictird~cipsto benefit ef society. At this pin:

-au-------"-

all these holistic doctrines are bound to abandon the secular methods 
of human science and logical reasoning and to shift to theologicaI or 
metaphysical professions of faith. They must assume that Providence, 
through its prophets. apostles, and charismatic leaders, forces men 
who are constitutionally wiclted, i.e., prone to pursue their own ends, 
to walk in the ways of righteousness which the Lord or Weltgeist or 
history wants them to walk. 

This is the philosophy which has characterized from time im- 
memorial the creeds of primitive tribes. It has been an element in all 


Human Action 

religious teachings. Man is bound to comply with the law issued by 
a superhuman power and to obey the authorities which this power 
has entrusted with the enforccment of the law. The order created by 
this law, human society, is consequently the work of the Deity and 
not of man. If the Lord had not interfered and had not given en- 
lightenment to erring mankind, society would not have come into 
existence. It is true that social cooperation is a blessing for man; it is 
true that man could work his way up from barbarism and the moral 
and material distress of his primitive state only within the framework 
of society. However, if lcft alone hc would never have sccn the road 
to his own salvation. For adjustment to the requiremcnts of social 
cooperation and subordination to the precepts of the moral law put 
heavy restraints upon him. From the point of view of his wretched 
intellect he would deem the abandonment of some expected advan- 
tage an evil and a privation. He would fail to recognize the in-
comparably greater, but later, advantages which renunciation of 
present and visible pleasures will procure. But for supernatural revela- 
tion he would never have learned what destiny wants him to do for 
his ow-n good and that of his offspring. 

The scientific theory as deveIoped by the social philosophy of 
eighteenth-century rationalism and modcrn economics does not re- 
sort to any miraculous interference of superhuman powers. Every 
step by which an individual substitutes concerted action for isolated 
action results in an immediate and recognizable improvement in his 
conditions. The advantages derivcd from peaceful cooperation and 
division of labor are universal. They immediately benefit every gen- 
eration, and not only Iater descendants. For what the individual must 
sacrifice for the sake of society he is amply conpcnsated by greater 
advantages. His sacrifice is only apparent and temporary; he foregoes 
a sn~aller gain in order to reap a greatcr one later. No reasonable be- 
ing can fail to see this obvious fact. When social cooperation is in- 
tensified by enlarging the field in which there is division of labor or 
when !ega! pt~~ti~fi nf peace are str~no.thrnrrl,

2nd the s2femi~rding

b-----" 

the incentive is the desire of all those concerned to improve their own 
conditions. In striving after his own-rightly understood-interests 
the individual works toward an intensification of social cooperation 
and peaceful intercourse. Society is a product of human action, i.e., 
the human urge to remove uneasiness as far as possible. In order to 
explain its becoming and its evolution it is not necessary to have 
recourse to a doctrine, certainly offensive to a truly religious mind, 
according to which the original creation was so defective that reiter- 
ated superhuman intervention is needed to prevent its failure. 


Human Society I47 

The historical role of the theory of the division of labor as elab- 
orated by British political economy from Hume to Ricardo con-
sisted in the cornplete demolition of all metaphysical doctrines 
concerning the origin and the operation of social cooperation. It 
consummated the spiritual, moral and intellectuaI emancipation of 
mankind inaugurated by the philosophy of Epicureanism. It sub- 
stituted an autonomous rational morality for the hctcronomous and 
intuitionist ethics of older days. Law and legality, the moral code and 
social institutions are no longer revered as unfathomable decrees of 
Heaven. They are of human origin, and the only yardstick that must 
be applied to them is that of expediency with regard to human wel- 
fare. Thc utilitarian economist does not say: Fiat justitia, pereat mun- 
dus. He says: Fiat justitia, nc pcreat mundus. He does not ask a man to 
renounce his well-being for the bencfit of society. He advises him to 
recognize what his rightly understood interests are. In his eyes God's 
magnificence does not manifest itseIf in busy interference with sundry 
affairs of princes and politicians, but in endowing his creatures with 
reason and the urge toward the pursuit of happiness." 

The essential problem of all varieties of universalistic, coIlectivistic, 
and holistic social philosophy is: By what mark do I recognize the 
true law, the authentic apostIe of God's word, and the legitimate 
authority. For many claim that Providence has sent them, and each 
of these prophets preaches another gospel. For the faithful believer 
there cannot he any doubt; he is fully confident that he has espoused 
the only true doctrine. But it is precisely the firmness of such beliefs 
that renders the antagonisms irreconcilable. Each party is prepared 
to make its own tenets prevail. But as Iogical argumentation cannot 
decide between various dissenting creeds, there is no means left for 
the settlement of such disputes other than armed conflict. The non- 
rationalist, nonutilitarian, and nonliberaI social doctrines must beget 
wars and civil wars until one of the adversaries is annihilated or sub- 
dued. The history of the world's great religions is a record of battles 

3. Many economists, among them Adam Smith and Bastiat, believed in God. 
Hence they admired in the facts they had discovered the providential care of 
"the great Director of Nature." Atheist critics blame them for this attitude. 
However, these critics fail to realize that to sneer at the references to the "in- 
visible hand" does not invaIidate the essential teachings of the rationalist and 
utilitarian social philosophy. One must comprehend that the alternative is this: 
Either association is a human process because it best serves the aims of the in- 
dividuals concerned and the individuals themselves have the ability to realize 
the advantages they derive from their adjustment to life in social cooperation. 
Or a superior being enjoins upon reluctant men subordination to the law and 
to the social authorities. It is of minor importance whether one calls this su- 
preme being God, Weltgcist, Destiny, History, Wotan, or Productive Forces 
and what title one assigns to its apostles, the dictators. 

Human Action 

and wars, as is the history of the present-day counterfeit religions, 
socialism, statolatry, and nationalism. 

Intolerance and propaganda by the executioner's or the soldier's 
sword are inherent in any system of heteronomous ethics. The laws 
of God or Destiny claim universal validity, and to the authorities 
which they declare Iegitirnate all men by rights owe obedience. As 
ions as the prestige of heteronomous codes of morality and of their 
philosophical corollary, conceptual realism, was intact, there could 
not be any question of tolerance or of lasting peace. When fighting 
ccascd, it was only to g-ather new strength for further battling. The 
idea of tolerance with regard to othcr people's dissenting views could 
take root only whcn the liberal doctrines had broken the spell of 
universalism. In the light of the utilitarian philosophy, society and 
state no longer appear as institutions for the maintenance of a world 
ordcr that for considerations hidden to the human mind pleases the 
Deity although it manifestly hurts the secular interests of many or 
even of the immense majority of those living today. Societv and 
state are on the contrary the primary means for a11 people to attain 
the ends they aim at of their own accord. They are created by human 
effort and their maiiltenance and most suitable organization are a 
task not essentially different from all other concerns of human action. 
The supporters of a heteronomous morality and of the collectivistic 
doctrine cannot hope to demonstrate by ratiocination the correct- 
ness of their spccific variety of ethical pEinciples and the superiority 
and exclusive legitimacy of their particular social ideal. They are 
forced to ask people to accept credulously their ideological system 
and to surrender to the authority they consider the right one; they 
are intent upon silencing dissenters or upon beating them into sub- 
mission. 

Of course, there will always be individuals and groups of individ- 
uals whose inrellcct is so narrow that they cannot grasp the benefits 
which social cooperation brings them. There are others whose moral 
strength and will power are so weak that they cannot resist the tempta- 
tion to strivc for an ephemeral advantage by actions dctrimental 
to the smooth functioning of the social system. For the adjustment of 
the individual to the requircrnents of social cooperation demands 
sacrifices. Thesc are, it is true, only temporary and apparent sacri- 
fices as they are more than cornpensatcd for by the incomparably 
grcater advantages w-hich living within society provides. However, at 
the instant, in the very act of renouncing an expected enjoyment, 
they are painful, and it is not for everybody to realize their later 
benefits and to behave accordingly. Anarchism believes that educa- 


Human Society 

tion could make all people comprehend what their own interests re- 
quire them to do; rightly instructed they would of their own accord 
always comply with the rules of conduct indispensable for the pres- 
ervation of society. The anarchists contend that a social order in 
which nobody enjoys privileges at the expense of his fellow-citizens 
could exist without any compulsion and cocrcion for the prevention 
of action detrimental to society. Such an ideal society could do 
without state and government; i.e., without a police force, the social 
apparatus of coercion and compulsion. 

The anarchists overlook the undeniable fact that some people are 
either too narrow-minded or too weak to adjust thernselves spon- 
taneously to the conditions of social life. Even if we admit that every 
sane adult is endowed with the faculty of realizing the good of 
socia1 cooperation and of acting accordingly, there still remains the 
problem of the infants, the aged, and the insane. We may agree that 
he who acts antisocially should be considered mentally sick and in 
need of care. But as long as not all are cured, and as long as there are 
infants and the senile, some provision must be taken lest they jeopard- 
ize society. An anarchistic society would be exposed to the mercy of 
every individual. Society cannot exist if the majority is not ready to 
hinder, by the application or threat of violent action, minorities from 
destroying the social order. This power is vested in the state or govern- 
ment. 

State or government is the social apparatus of compulsion and 
coercion. It has the monopoly of violent action. No individual is 
free to use violence or the threat of violence if the government has 
not accorded this right to him. The state is essentially an institution 
for the preservation of peaceful interhuman relations. However, for 
the preservation of peace it must be prepared to crush the onslaughts 
of peace-breakers. 

Liberal social doctrine, based on the teachings of utilitarian ethics 
arid economics, sees the problem of the relation between the govern- 
ment and those ruled from a different angle than universalism and 
collectivism. Liberalism realizes that the rulers, who are always a 
minority, cannot lastingly remain in office if not supported bi the 
consent of the majority of those ruled. Whatever the system of 
government may be, the foundation upon which it is built and rests 
is always the opinion of those ruled that to obey and to be loyal to this 
government better serves their own interests than insurrection and 
the establishment of another regime. The majority has the power to 
do away with an unpopular government and uses this power when-
ever it becomes convinced that its own welfare requires it. In the 


Human Action 
long run there is no such thing as an unpopular government. Civil war 
and revolution are the means by which thc discontented majorities 
overthrow' rulers and methods of government which do not suit 
them. For the sake of domestic peace liberalism aims at democratic 
government. Democracy is therefore not a revolutionary institution. 
On the contrary, it is the very means of preventing revolutions and 
civil wars. It provides a method for the peaceful adjustment of gov- 
ernment to the will of the majority. When the men in office arid their 
policies no longer please the majority of the nation, they will-in the 
next election-be eliminated and replaced by other men espousing 
different policies. 
The principle of majority rule or'government by the people as 
recommended by liberalism does not aim at the supremacy of the 
average or common marl. It certainly does not mean, as some critics 
assert, the advocacy of the rule of the mean, of the lowbred, of the 
domestic barbarians. The liberals too believe that a nation should be 
ruled by those best fitted for this task. But they believe that a man's 
ability to rule proves itself better by convincing his fellow-citizens 
than by using force upon them. There is, of course, no guarantee that 
the voters will entrust office to the most cornpetcnt candidate. But 
no other system could offer such a guarantee. If the majority of the 
nation is committed to unsound principles and prefers unworthy 
office-seekers, there is no remedy other than to try to change their 
mind by expounding more reasonable principles and recommending 
better men. A minority wilI never win lasting success by other means. 
Universalism and collectivism cannot accept this democratic solu- 
tion of the problem of government. I11 their opinion the individual 
in complying with the ethical code does not directly further his 
earthly concerns but, on the contrary, foregoes the attainment of his 
own ends for the benefit of the designs of the Deity or of the col- 
lective whole. Moreover reason alone is not capable of conceiving 
the supremacy of the absolute values and the unconditional validity 
of rhe sacred iaw and of interpreting correctiy the canons and com- 
mandments. Hence it is in their eyes a hopeless task to try to con- 
vince the majority through persuasion and to lead them to ;ighteous- 
ness by amicable admonition. Those blessed by heavenly inspiration, 
to whom their charisma has conveyed illumination, have the duty 
to propagate the gospel to the docile and to resort to violence against 
the intractable. The charismatic leader is the Deity's vicar, the man- 
datory of the collective whole, the tool of history. He is infallible 
and always right. His orders are the supreme norm. 
Universalism and collectivism arc by necessity systems of theocratic 


Human Society IS1 

government. The common characteristic of all their varieties is that 
they postulate the existence of a supcrhurnan entity which the in- 
dividuals are bound to obey. What differentiates them from one 
another is only the appellation they give to this entity and the content 

of the laws they proclaim in its name. The dictatorial rule of a minor- 
ity cannot find any legitimation other than the appeal to an alleged 
~nandatc obtained from a superhuman absolute authority. It does not 
matter whether the absolute ruler bases his claims on the divine rights 
of anointed kings or on the historical mission of the vanguard of the 
proletariat or whether the supreme being is called Geist (Hegel) or 
Humanit; (Auguste Comte) .The terms society and state as they are 
used by the contemporary advocates of socialism, planning, and social 
contro1 of all the activities of individuals signify a deity. The priests 
of this new creed ascribe to their idol all those attributes which the 
theologians ascribe to God-omnipotence, omniscience, infinite good- 

ness, and so on. 

If one assumes that there exists above and beyond the individual's 

actions an imperishable entity aiming at its own ends, different from 

those of mortal men, one has already constructed the concept of a 

superhuman being. Then one cannot evade the question whose ends 

take precedence whenever an antagonism arises, those of the state or 

society or those of the individual. The answer to this question is 

already implied in the very concept of state or society as conceived 

by collectivism and universalism. If one postulates the existence of 

an entity which ex definitione is higher, nobler, and better than the 

individuals, then there cannot be any doubt that the aims of this 

eminent being must tower above those of the wretched individuals. 

(It is true that some lovers of paradox-for instance, Max Stirner 4-

took pleasure in turning the matter upside down and for all that 

asserted the precedence of the individual.) If society or state is an 

entity endowed with volition and intention and all the other qualities 

attributed to it by the collectivist doctrine, then it is simply non- 

sensical to sct the shabby iddividual's trivial aims against its lofty 

designs. 

The quasi-theological character of all collectivist doctrines be- 

comes manifest in their mutual conflicts. Acollectivist doctrine does 

not assert the superiority of a collective whole in abstracto; it always 

proclaims the eminence of a definite collectivist idol, and either flatly 

denies the existence of other such idols or relegates them to a sub-

ordinate and ancillary position with regard to its own idol. The 

4. Cf. Max Stirner (Johann Kaspar Schmidt), The Egoand His Own, trans. 
by S.T. Byington (New York, 1~7). 

Human Action 

worshipers of the state proclaim the excellence of a definite state, 
i.e., their own; the nationalists, the excellence of their own nation. 
If dissenters challenge their particular program by heralding the 
superiority of another collectivist idol they resort to no objection 
other than to declare again and again: We are right bccause an inner 
voice tells us that we are right and you are wrong. The conflicts of 
antagonistic coIlcctivist creeds and sects cannot be decided by ratio- 
cination; they must be decided by arms. The aIternatives to the 
lit~eral and democratic principle of majority rule are the militarist 
principles of armed conflict: and dictatorial oppression. 

All varieties of collectivist creeds are united in their implacable 
hostility to the fundamental political institutions of the liberal system: 
majority rule, tolerance of dissenting views, freedom of thought, 
speech, and the press, equaIity of all men under the law. This col- 
laboration of collectivist creeds in their attempts to destroy free- 
dom has brought about the mistaken belief that the issue in present- 
day political antagonisms is individualism versus collectivisn~. In fact 
it is a struggle between individualism on the one hand and a multitude 
of collectivist sects on the other hand whose mutuaI hatred and 
hostility is no less ferocious than their abomination of the liberal 
system. It is not a uniform Marxian sect that attacks capitalism, but a 
host of Mamian groups. These groups-for instance, Stalinists, Trot- 
skyists, Mensheviks, supporters of the Second International, and so 
on-fight one another with the utmost brutality and inhumanity. 
And then there are again many other non-Marxian sects which apply 
the same atrocious methods in their mutuaI struggles. A substitution 
of collectivism for liberalism would result in endless bloody fighting. 

The customary terminology misrepresents these things entirely. 
The philosophy commonly called individualism is a philosophy of 
social cooperation and thi progressive intensification of the social 
nexus. On the other hand the application of the basic ideas of col- 
lectivism cannot result in anything but social disintegration and the 
pcr~etmti~r.of armed conflic:. 1: is :ric that eviv vxietji of col-
lectivism promises eternal peace starting with the day of its own 
decisive victory and the final overthrow and extermination of all 
other ideologies and their supporters. However, the realization of 
these plans is conditioned upon a radical transformation in mankind. 
Men must be divided into two classcs: the omnipotent godlike dictator 
on the one hand and the masses which must surrender volition and 
reasoning in order to become mere chessmen in the plans of the 
dictator. The masses must be dehumanized in order to make one 
man their godlike master. Thinking and acting, the foremost char- 


Hurnaa Society 

acteristics of man as man, would become the privilege of one man 
only. There is no need to ~oint out that such designs are unrealizable. 
The chiliastic empires of dictators are doomed to failure; they have 
nevcr lasted longer than a few years. We have just witnessed the 
breakdown of several of such "millennial" orders. Those remaining 
will hardly fare better. 

The modern revival of the idea of coIlectivism, the main cause of 
all the agonies and disasters of our day, has succeeded so thoroughly 
that it has brought into oblivion thc essential ideas of liberal social 
philosophy. Today even many of those favoring democratic insti- 
tutions ignore thesc ideas. Thc arguments they bring forward for the 
justification of freedom and democracy are tainted with collectivist 
errors; their doctrines are rather a distortion than an endorsement of 
true liberalism. In their eyes majorities are always right simply be- 
cause they have the power to crush any opposition; majority rule 
is the dictatorial rule of the most numerous party, and the ruling 
majority is not bound to restrain itself in the exercise of its power 
and in the conduct of political affairs. As soon as a faction has 
succeeded in winning the support of the majority of citizens and 
thercby attained control of the government machine, it is free to 
dcny to the minority all those democratic rights by means of which 
it itself has previously carried on its own struggle for supremacy. 

This pseudo-liberalism is, of course, the very antithesis of the 
liberal doctrine. The liberals do not maintain that majorities are 
godlike and infallible; they do not contend that the merc fact that a 
policy is advocated by the many is a proof of its merits for the com- 
mon weal. They do not rccornmend the dictatorship of the majority 
and thc violcnt oppression of disscnting minorities. Liberalism aims 
at a political constitution which safepards the smooth working of 
social cooperation and the progressive intensification of mutual so- 
cial relations. Its main objective is the avoidance of violent conflicts, 
of wars and revolutions that must disintegrate the social collabora- 
tion of men and throw people back into the primitive conditions of 
barbarism where all tribes and political bodies endlessly fought one 
another. Because the division of labor requires undisturbed peace, 
liberalism aims at the estabIishmcnt of a systcm of government that 
is likely to preserve peace, viz., democracy. 

Praxeology and Liberalism 

Liberalism is a political doctrine. It is not a theory, but an appIication of 
the theories developed by praxeology and especially by economics to def-
inite problems of human action within society. 


Human Action 

As a political doctrine liberalism is not neutral with regard to values and 
the ultimate ends sought by action. It assumes that all men or at least the 
majority of people are intent upon attaining certain goals. It gives them 
information about the means suitable to the realization of their plans. Tke 
champions of liberal doctrines are fully aware of the fact that their teach- 
ings are valid only for people who are committed to these valuational 
principles. 

While praxeology, and therefore economics too, uses the terms hap- 
piness and removal of uneasiness in a purely formal sense, liberalisni at- 
taches to them a concrete meaning. It presupposes that peopIe prefer life 
to death, health to sickness, nourishment to starvation, abundance to 
poverty. It teaches man how to act in accordance with these valuations. 

It is customary to call these concerns ~naterialistic and to charge liberal- 
ism with an alleged crude materialism and a neglect of the "higher" and 
"nobler" pursuits of mankind. Man does not live by bread alone, say the 
critics, and they disparage the meanness and despicable baseness of the 
utilitarian philosophy. However, thesc passionate diatribes are wrong be- 
cause they badly distort the teachings of liberalism. 

First: The liberals do not assert that men ought to strive after the goals 
mentioned above. What they maintain is that the immense majority prefer 
a life of health and abundance to misery, starvation, and death. The cor- 
rectness of this statement cannot be challenged. It is proved by the fact 
that all antiliberal doctrines-the theocratic tenets of the various religious, 
statist, nationalist, and socialist parties-adopt the same attitude with re- 
gard to these issues. They all promise their followers a life of plenty. They 
have never ventured to tell people that the realization of their program 
will impair their material well-being. They insist-on the contrary-that 
while the realization of the plans of their rival parties will resuIt in in- 
digence for the majority, they themselves want to provide their supporters 
with abundance. The Christian parties are no less eager in promising the 
masses a higher standard of living than the nationalists and the socialists. 
Present-day churches often speak more about raising wage rates and farm 
incomes than about the dogmas of the Christian doctrine. 

Secondly: The liberals do not disdain the intellectual and spiritual aspira- 
tions of man. On the contrary. They arc prompted by a passionate ardor 
for intellectual and moral perfection, for wisdom and for aesthetic excel- 
lence. But their view of these high and noble things is far from the crude 
representations of their adversaries. They do not share the na'ive opinion 
that any system of social organization can directly succeed in encouraging 
philosophical or scientific thinking, in producing masterpieces of art and 
literature and in rendering the masses more enlightened. They realize 
that all that society can achieve in these fields is to provide an environment 
which does not put insurmountable obstacles in the way of the genius and 
makes the common man free enough from material concerns to be- 
come interested in things other than mere breadwinning. In their opinion 
the foremost social means of making man more human is to fight poverty. 


Human Society 

Wisdom and science and the arts thrive better in a world of aflluencc than 
among needy peoples. 

It is a purposeful distortion of facts to blame thc age of liberalism for 
an alleged materialism. The nineteenth century was not only a century of 
unprecedented improvement in technical methods of production and in 
the material well-being of the masses. It did much more than extend the 
average length of human life. Its scientific and artistic accomplishments 
are imperishable. It was an age of immortal musicians, writers, poets, 
painters, and sculptors; it revolutionized philosophy, economics, mathe- 
matics, physics, chemistry, and biology. And, for the first time in history, 
it made the great works and the great thoughts accessible to the common 
man. 

Liberalism and Religion 

Liberalism is based upon a purely rational and scientific theory of social 
cooperation. The policies it recommends are the application of a system 
of knowledge which does not refer in any way to sentiments, intuitive 
creeds for which no logically sufficient proof can be provided, mystical 
experiences, and the personal awareness of superhuman phenomena. In 
this sense the often misunderstood and erroneously interpreted epithets 
atheistic and agnostic can be attributed to it. It would, howeyer, be a 
serious mistake to conclude that the sciences of human action and the 
policy derived from their teachings, liberalism, are antitlleistic and hostile 
to religion. They arc radically opposed to all systems of theocracy. But 
they are entirely neutral with regard to religious beliefs which do not pre- 
tend to interfere with the conduct of social, political, and economic affairs. 

Theocracy is a social system which lays claim to a superhuman title for 
its legitimation. The fundamental law of a theocratic regime is an insight 
not open to examination by reason and to demonstration by logical 
methods. Its ultimate standard is intuition providing the mind with sub- 
jective certainty about things which cannot be conceived by reason and 
ratiocination. If this intuition refers to one of the traditional systcms of 
teaching concerning the existence of a Divine Creator and Ruler of the 
universe, we call it a religious belief. If it refers to another system we call 
it a metaphysical belief. Thus a system of theocratic government need not 
be founded on one of the great historical reiigions of the worid. it may 
be the outcome of metaphysicaI tenets which reject all traditional churches 
and denominations and take pride in emphasizing their antitheistic and 
antimetaphysical character. In our time the most powerful theocratic 
parties are opposed to Christianity and to all other religions which evolved 
from Jewish monotheism. What characterizes them as theocratic is their 
craving to organize the earthly affairs of mankind according to the con- 
tents of a complex of ideas whose validity cannot be demonstrated by 
reasoning. They pretend that their leaders are blcssed by a knowledge in- 
accessible to the rest of mankind and contrary to the ideas maintained by 
those to whom the charisma is denied. The charismatic leaders have been 


156 Human Action 

entrusted by a mystical higher power with the office of managing the 
affairs of erring mankind. They alone are enlightened; all other people are 
either blind and deaf or malefactors. 

It is a fact that many varieties of the great historical religions were af- 
fected by theocratic tendencies. Their apostles were inspired by a craving 
for power and the oppression and annihilation of all dissenting groups. 
However, we must not confuse the two things, religion and theocracy. 

William James calls religious "the feelings, acts and experiences of in- 
dividual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to 
stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." He enumer- 
ates the following beliefs as the characteristics of the religious life: That 
the visible world is part of a more spiritual universe from which it draws 
its chief significance; that union or harnlonious relation with that higher 
universe is our true end; that prayer or inner communion with the spirit 
thereof-be that spirit "God" or "law"-is a process wherein work is 
really done, and spiritual energy flows in and produces effects, psychologi- 
cal or material, within the phenomena1 world. Religion, James goes on to 
say, also includes the following psychological characteristics: A new zest 
which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes the form either of lyrical 
enchantment or of appeal to earnestness and heroism, and furthermore an 
assurance of safety and a temper of peace, and, in relation to others, a pre- 
ponderance of loving aff ection.6 

This characterization of mankind's religious experience and feelings does 
not make any reference to the arrangement of social cooperation. Religion, 
as James sees it, is a purely personal and individual relation between man 
and a holy, mystcrious, and awe-inspiring divine Reality. It enjoins upon 
man a certain mode of individual conduct. But it does not assert anything 
with regard to the problems of social organization. St. Francis d'Assisi, the 
greatest religious genius of the West, did not concern himself with politics 
and economics. He wanted to teach his disciples how to live piously; he 
did not draft a plan for the organization of production and did not urge 
his followers to resort to violence against dissenters. He is not responsible 
for the interpretation of his teachings by the order he founded. 

Liberalism puts no obstacles in the way of a man eager to adjust his per- 
sonal conduct and his private affairs according to the mode in which he 
mdividually or his church or denomination interpret the teachings of the 
Gospels. But it is radically opposed to all endeavors to silence the rational 
discussion of problems of social welfare by an appeal to religious intuition 
and revelation. It does not enjoin divorce or the practice of birth control 
upon anybody. But it fights those who want to prevent other people from 
freely discussing the pros and cons of these matters. 

In the liberal opinion the aim of the moral law is to impel individuals to 

adjust their conduct to the requirements of life in society, to abstain from 

5. W. James, The Varieties of Religious Experience (35th impression, New 
York, 19rj),p. 31. 
6.Ibid., pp. 485-486. 

Human Society 

all acts detrimental to the preservation of peaceful social cooperation and 
to the improvement of interhuman relations. They welcome the support 
which religious teachings may give to those moral precepts of which they 
themselves approve, but they are opposed to all those norms which are 
bound to bring about social distintegration from whatever source they 
may stem. 

It is a distortion of fact to say, as many champions of religious theocracy 
do, that liberalism fights religion. Where the principle of church inter- 
ference with secular issues is in force, the various churches, denominations 
and sects are fighting one another. By separating church and state, liberal- 
ism establishes peace between the various religious factions and gives to 
each of them the opportunity to preach its gospel unmolested. 

Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince 
the immense majority that peaceful cooperation within the framework of 
society better serves their rightly understood interests than mutual 
battling and social disintegration. It has full confidence in man's reason. It 
may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. 
But then there is no hope left for mankind's future. 

3. The Division of Labor 
The fundamental social phenomenon is the division of labor and 
its counterpart human cooperation. 

Experience teaches man that cooperative action is more efficient 
and productive than isolated action of self-sufficient individuals. The 
natural conditions dcterrnining man's life and effort are such that the 
division of labor increases output per unit of labor expended. These 
naturaI facts are: 

First: the innate inequality of men with regard to their ability to 
perform various kinds of labor. Second: the unequal distribution of 
the nature-given, nonhuman opportunities of production on the sur- 
face of the earth. One may as well consider these two facts as one 
and the samc fact, namely, the manifoIdness of nature which makes 
the universe a compicx of infinite varieties. if the earth's surface were 
such that the physical conditions of production were the same at every 
point and if one man wcre as equal to all other men as is a circle to 
another with the same diameter in Euclidian geometry, division of 
labor would not offer any advantages for acting man. 

There is still a third fhct, viz., that there are undertakings whose 
accomplishment exceeds the forces of a single man and requires the 
joint effort of several. Some of them require an expenditure of labor 
which no single man can perform because his capacity to work is not 
great enough. Others again could be accomplished by individuals; 


158 Human Action 

but the time which they would have to devote to the work would 
be so long that the result would only be attained late and would not 
compensate for the labor expended. In borh cases only joint effort 
makes it possible to attain the end sought. 

If only this third condition were present, temporary cooperation 
between men would have certainly emerged. However, such tran- 
sient alliances to cope with specific tasks which are beyond the 
strength of an individual would not have brought about lasting social 
cooperation. Undertakings which could be performed only in this 
way were not very numerous at the early stages of civilization. Allore- 
over, all those concerned may not often agree that the performance in 
question is more useful and urgent than the accomplishment of other 
tasks which they could perform alone. The great human society en- 
closing all men in all of their activities did not originate from such oc- 
casional alliances. Society is much more than a passing alliance con- 
cluded for a definite purpose and ceasing as soon as its objective is 
realized, even if the partners are ready to renew it should an occasion 
present itself. 

?he increase in productivity brought about by the division of labor 
is obvious whenever the inequality of the participants is such that 
every individual or every piece of land is superior at least in one 
regard to the other individuals or pieces of land concerned. If A is fit 
to produce in I unit of time 6 p or 4 q and B only 2 p, but 8 q, they 
both, when working in isolation, will produce together 4 p +6 q; 
when working under the division of labor, each of them producing 
only that comnlodity in whose production he is more efficient than 
his partner, they will produce 6 p +8 q. But what will happen, if A 
is more efficient than B not only in the production of p but also in the 
production of q? 

This is the problem which Ricardo raised and solved immediately. 

4. The Ricardian Law of Association 
Ricardo expounded the law of association in order to demonstrate 
what the consequences of the division of labor are when an individual 
or a group, more efficient in every regard, cooperates with an in- 
dividual or a group less efficient in every regard. He investigated the 
effects of trade between two areas, unequally endowed by nature, 
under the assumption that the products, but not the workers and the 
accumulated factors of future production (capita1 goods), can freely 
move from each area into the other. The division of labor between two 
such areas will, as Ricardo's law shows, increase the productivity of 


Human Society 

labor and is therefore advantageous to all concerned, even if the 
physical conditions of production for any commodity are more 
favorable in one of these two areas than in the other. It is advanta- 
geous for the better endowed area to concentrate its efforts upon the 
production of those commodities for which its superiority is greater, 
and to leave to the less endowed area the production of other goods in 
which its own superiority is less. The paradox that it is more advanta- 
geous to leave more favorable domestic conditions of production un- 
used and to procure the commodities they could produce from areas 
in which conditions for their production are less favorable, is the out- 
come of the immobility of labor and capital, to which the more fa- 
vorable places of production are inaccessible. 

Ricardo was fully aware of the fact that his law of comparative 
cost, which he expounded mainly in order to deal with a special prob- 
lem of international trade, is a particular instance of the more uni- 
versal law of association. 

If A is in such a way more efficient than B that he needs for the 
production of r unit of the commodity p 3 hours compared with B's 
5, and for the production of I unit of q 2 hours compared with B's 
4, then both will gain if A confines himself to producing q and leaves 
B to produce p. If each of them gives 60 hours to producing p and 60 
hours to producing q, the result of A's labor is zo p +30 q; of B7s, 
I 2 p +I 5 q; and for both together, 32 p +45 q. If, however, A con-
fines himself to producing q alone, he produces 60 q in 120 hours, 
while B, if he confines himself to producing p, produces in the same 
time 24p. The result of their activities is then 24p +60 q, which, asp 

5

has for A a substitution ratio of 3q and for B one of -q, signifies a 

2 4 
larger output than 32 p +45 q. Therefore it is rnanifest'that the divi- 
sion of labor brings advantages to all who take part in it. Collaboration 
of the more talented, more able, and more industrious with the less 
talented, less able, and less industrious results in benefit for both. The 
gains derived from the division of iabor are aiways mutuai. 

The law of association makes us comprehend the tendencies which 
resulted in the progressive intensification of human cooperation. We 
conceive what incentive induced people not to consider themselves 
simply as rivals in a struggle for the appropriation of the limited supply 
of means of subsistence made available by nature. We realize what 
has impelled them and permanently impels them to consort with 
one another for the sake of cooperation. Every step forward on the 
way to a more developed mode of the division of labor serves the 
interests of all participants. In order to comprehend why man did not 


I 60 Human Action 

remain solitary, searching like the animals for food and shelter for 
himself only and at most also for his consort and his helpless infants, 
we do not need to have recourse to a miraculous interference of the 
Deity or to the empty hypostasis of an innate urge toward associa- 
tion. Neither are we forced to assume that the isolated individuals or 
primitive hordes one day pledged themselves by a contract to estab- 
lish social bonds. The factor that brought about primitive society 
and daily works toward its progressive intensification is human action 
that is &hated by the insight into the higher productivity of labor 
achieved under the division of labor. 

Neither history nor ethnology nor any other branch of knowl- 
edge can provide a description of the evolution which has led from 
the packs and flocks of mankind's nonhuman ancestors to the primi- 
tive, yet already highly differentiated, societal groups about which 
information is provided in excavations, in the most ancient documents 
of history, and in the reports of explorers and travelers who have met 
savage tribes. The task with which science is faced in respect of the 
origins of society can only consist in the demonstration of those 
factors which can and must result in association and its progressive 
intensification. Praxeology solves the problem. If and as far as labor 
under the division of labor is more productive than isolated labor, and 
if and as far as man is able to realize this fact, human action itself 
tends toward cooperation and association; man becomes a social be- 
ing not in sacrificing his own concerns for the sake of a mythical 
Moloch, society, but in aiming at an improvement in his own wel- 
fare. Experience teaches that this condition-higher productivity 
achieved under the division of labor-is present because its cause-the 
inborn inequality of men and the inequality in the geographica1 dis- 
tribution of the natural factors of production-is real. Thus we are in 
a position to comprehend the course of social evolution. 

People cavil much about Ricardo's law of association, better known 
under the name law of comparative cost. The reason is obvious. This law 
is an offense to all those eager to justify protection and nationaI economic 
isolation from any point of view other than the selfish interests of some 
producers or the issues of war-preparedness. 

Ricardo's first aim in expounding this law was to refute an objection 
raised against freedom of international trade. The protectionist asks: What 
under free trade will be the fate of a country in which the conditions for 
any kind of production are less favorable than in all other countries? Now, 
in a world in which there is free mobility not only for products, but no 


H'uman Society I 6 I 

less for capital goods and for labor, a country so little suited for produc- 
tion would cease to be used as the seat of any human industry. If people 
fare better without exploiting the-comparatively unsatisfactory-physi-
cal conditions of production offered by this country, they will not settle 
here and will leave it as uninhabited as the polar regions, the tundras and 
the deserts. But Ricardo deals with a world whose conditions are deter- 
mined by settlement in earlier days, a world in which capital goods and 
labor are bound to thc soil by definite institutions. In such a milieu free 
trade, i.e., the free mobility of commodities only, cannot bring about a 
state of affairs in which capital and labor are distributed on the surface of 
the earth according to the better or poorer physical opportunities afforded 
to the productivity of labor. Here the law of comparative cost comes into 
operation. Each country turns toward those branches of production for 
which its conditions offer comparatively, although not absolutely, the 
most favorable opportunities. For the inhabitants of a country it is more 
advantageous to abstain from the exploitation of some opportunities which 
-absolutely and technologically-are more propitious and to import corn- 
modities produced abroad under conditions which-absolutely and tech- 
nologically-are less favorable than the unused domestic resources. The 
case is analogous to that of a surgeon who finds it convenient to employ for 
the cleaning of the operating-room and the instruments a man whom he 
excels in this performance also and to devote himself exclusively to surgery, 
in which his superiority is higher. 

The theorem of comparative cost is in no way connected with the value 
theory of classical economics. It does not deal with value or with prices. 
It is an analytic judgment; the conclusion is implied in the two propositions 
that the technicaIly movable factors of production differ with regard to 
their productivity in various places and are institutionally restricted in 
their mobility. The theorem, without prejudice to the correctness of its 
conclusions, can disregard problems of valuation because it is free to re- 
sort to a set of simple assumptions. These are: that only two products are 
to be produced; that these products are freely movable; that for the pro- 
duction of each of them two factors are required; that one of these factors 

(it may be either labor or capital goods) is identical in the production of 
both, while the other factor (a specific property of the soil) is different 
for each of the two proccsscs, that the greatcr scarcity irf the factor coin- 
mon to both processes determines the extent of the exploitation of the dif- 
ferent factor. In the frame of these assumptions, which makc it possible 
to establish substitution ratios between the expenditure of the common 
factor and the output, the theorem answers the question raised. 

The law of comparative cost is as independent of the classical theory of 
value as is the law of returns, which its reasoning resembles. In both cases 
we can content ourselves with comparing only physical input and physical 
output. With the law of returns we compare the output of the same prod- 
uct. With the law of comparative costs we compare the output of two 
different products. Such a comparison is feasible because we assume that 


I 62 Human Action 

for the production of each of them, apart from one specific factor, only 
nonspecific factors of the same kind arc required. 

Some critics blame the law of comparative cost for this simplification 
of assumptions. They believe that the modern theory of value would rc- 
quire a reformulation of the law in conformity with the principles of 
subjective value. Only such a formulation could provide a satisfactory con- 
clusive demonstration. Howevcr, they do not want to calculate in terms 
of money. They prefer to resort to those methods of utility analysis which 
they consider a means for making value calculations in terms of utility. It 
will be shown in thc further progress of our investigation that these at- 
tempts to eliminate monetary terms from economic calculation are de- 
lusive. Their fundamental assumptions are untenable and contradictory and 
all formulas derived from them are vicious. No method of economic cal- 
cuiation is possible other than onc based on money prices as determined by 
the market.? 

The meaning of the simple assun~ptions underlying the law of compara- 
tive cost is not precisely the same for the modern economists as it was 
for the classical economists. Some adherents of the classical school con- 
sidered them as the starting point of a theory of value in international 
trade. We know now that they were mistaken in this belief. Besides, we 
realize that with regard to the determination of value and of prices there 
is no difference between domestic and foreign trade. What makes people 
distinguish between the home market and markets abroad is only a dif- 
ference in the data, LC., varying institutional conditions restricting thc 
mobility of factors of production and of products. 

If we do not want to deal with the law of comparative cost under the 
simplified assumptions applied by Ricardo, we must openly employ money 
calculation. We must not fall prey to the illusion that a comparison be- 
tween the expenditure of factors of production of various kinds and of the 
output of products of various kinds can be achieved without the aid of 
money calculation. If we consider the case of the surgeon and his handyman 
we must say: If the surgeon can employ his limited working time for the 
performance of operations for which he is compensated at $50 per hour, 
it is to his interest to employ a handyman to keep his instruments in good 
order and to pay him $2 per hour, although this man needs 3 hours to ac-
complish what the surgeon could do in I hour. In comparing the conditions 
of two countries we must say: If conditions are such that in England the 
production of I unit of each of the two commodities a and b requires the 
expenditure of I working day of the same kind of labor, while in India 
with the same investment of capital for a 2 days and for b 3 days are re- 
quired, and if capital goods and n and b are freely movable from England 
to India and vice versa, while there is no mobility of labor, wage rates in 
India in the production of a must tend to be 50 per cent, and in the produc- 
tion of b 3 3 Yi?per cent, of the English rates. If the English rate is 6 shillings, 
the rates in India would be the equivalent of 3 shillings in the production 

7. See below, pp. 202-210. 

Human Society 163 

of n and the equivalent of 2 shillings in the production of b. Such a dis- 
crepancy in the remuneration of labor of the same kind cannot last if 
there is mobility of labor on the domestic Indian labor market. Workers 
would shift from the production of b into the production of a; their migra- 
tion would tend to lower the remuneration in the a industry and to raise 
it in the b industry. Finally Indian wage rates would be equal in both indus- 
tries. The production of a would tend to expand and to supplant English 
competition. On the other hand the production of b would become un- 
profitable in India and would have to be discontinued, while it would ex- 
pand in England. The same reasoning is valid if we assume that the dif- 
ference in the conditions of production consists also or exclusively in the 
amount of capital investment needed. 

It has been asserted that Ricardo's law was valid only for his age and is 
of no avail for our time which offers other conditions. Ricardo saw the dif- 
ference between domestic trade and foreign trade in differences in the 
mobility of capital and labor. If one assumes that capital, labor, and prod- 
ucts are movable, then there exists a difference between regional and 
interregional trade only as far as the cost of transportation comes into play. 
Then it is superfluous to develop a theory of international trade as dis- 
tinguished from national trade. Capital and labor are distributed on the 
earth's surface according to the better or poorer conditions which the 
various regions offer to production. There are areas more densely popu- 
lated and bctter equipped with capital, there are others less densely popu- 
lated and poorer in capital supply. There prcvails on the whole earth a 
tendency toward an equalization of wage rates for the same kind of labor. 

Ricardo, however, starts from the assumption that there is mobility of 
capital and labor only within each country, and not between the various 
countries. He raises the question what the consequences of the free mo- 
bility of products must be under such conditions. (If there is no mobility of 
products either, then every country is econon~ically isolated and autarkic, 
and there is no international trade at all.) The theory of comparative cost 
answers this question. Now, Ricardo's assumptions by and large held good 
for his age. Later, in the course of the nineteenth century, conditions 
changed. The immobility of capital and labor gave way; international 
transfer of capital and labor became more and more common. Then came 
a reaction. Today capital and labor are again restricted in their mobility. 
Reality again corresponds to the Ricardian assumptions. 

However, the teachings of the classical theory of interregional trade 

are above any change in institutional conditions. They enable us to study 

the problems involved under any imaginable assumptions. 

5. The Effects of the Division of Labor 
The division of Iabor is the outcome of man's conscious reaction to 
the multiplicity of natural conditions. On the other hand it is itself 
a factor bringing about differentiation. It assigns to the various geo- 


Human Action 

graphic areas specific functions in the complex of the processes of 
production. It makes some areas urban, others rural; it locates the 
various branches of manufacturing, mining, and agriculture in dif- 
ferent places. Still more important, however, is the fact that it in- 
tensifies the innate inequality of men. Exercise and practice of specific 
tasks adjust individuals better to the requirements of their perform- 
ance; men develop some of their inborn faculties and stunt the devel- 
opment of others. Vocational types emerge, people become specialists. 

The division of labor splits the various processes of production 
into minute tasks, many of which can be performed by mechanical 
devices. It is this fact that made the use of machinery possible and 
brought about the amazing improvements in technical methods of 
production. Mechanization is the fruit of the division of labor, its 
most beneficial achievement, not its motive and fountain spring. 
Power-driven specialized machinery could be employed only in a 
social environment under the division of labor. Every step forward 
on the road toward the use of more specialized, more refined, and 
more productive machines requires a further specialization of tasks. 

6. The Individual Within Society 
If praxeology speaks of the solitary individual, acting on his own 
behalf only and independent of fellow men, it does so for the sake of 
a better comprehension of the problems of social cooperation. We 
do not assert that such isolated autarkic human beings have ever lived 
and that the social stage of man's history was preceded by an age of 
independent individuals roaming like animals in search of food. The 
biological humanization of man's nonhuman ancestors and the emer- 
gence of the primitive social bonds were effected in the same process. 
Man appeared on the scene of earthly events as a social being. The 
isolated asocial man is a fictitious construction. 

Seen from the point of view of the individual, society is the great 
means for the attainment of all his ends, The preservation of society 
is an essential condition of any plans an individual may want to 
realize by any action whatever. Evcn the refractory delinquent who 
fails to adjust his conduct to the requirements of life within the 
societal system of cooperation does not want to miss any of the advan- 
tages derived from the division of labor. He does not consciously aim 
at the destruction of society. He wants to lay his hands on a greater 
portion of the jointly produced wealth than the social order assigns 
to him. He would feel miserable if antisocial behavior were to be- 
come universal and its inevitable outcome, the return to primitive 
indigence, resulted. 


Human Society I 6j 

It is illusory to maintain that individuals in renouncing the alleged 
blcssiags of a fabulous state of nature and entering into society have 
foregone some advantages and have a fair claim to be indemnified for 
what they have lost. The idea that anybody would have fared better 
under an asocial state of mankind and is wronged by the very exist- 
ence of society is absurd. Thanks to the higher productivity of social 
cooperation the human species has multiplied far beyond the margin 
of subsistence offered by the conditions prevailing in ages with a 
rudimentary degree of the division of labor. Each man enjoys a 
standard of living much higher than that of his savage ancestors. The 
natural condition of man is extreme poverty and insecurity. It is 
romantic nonsense to lament the passing of the happy days of primi- 
tive barbarism. In a state of savagery the complainants would either 
not have reached the age of manhood, or if they had, they would 
have lacked the opportunities and amenities provided by civilization. 
Jean Jacques Rousseau and Frederick Engels, if they had lived in the 
primitive state which they describe with nostalgic yearning, would 
not have enjoyed the leisure required for their studies and for the 
writing of their books. 

Onc of the privileges which society affords to the individual is 
the privilege of living in spite of sickness or physicaI disability. Sick 
animals are doomed. Their weakness handicaps them in their at-
tempts to find food and to repel aggression on the part of other ani- 
mals. Deaf, nearsighted, or crippled savages must perish. But such 
defects do not deprive a man of the opportunity to adjust himself to 
life in socicty. The majority of our contemporaries are afflicted with 
some bodily deficiencies which biology considers pathological. Our 
civilization is to a great extent the achievement of such men. The 
eliminative forces of natural selection are greatly reduced under 
social conditions. Hence some people say that civilization tends to 
deteriorate the hereditary qualities of the members of society. 

Such judgments are reasonable if one looks at mankind with the 
eyes of a breeder intent upon raising a race of men equipped with 
certain qualities. But society is not a stud-farm operated for the 
production of a definite type of men. There is no "natural" standard 
to establish what is desirable and what is undesirable in the biological 
evolution of man. Any standard chosen is arbitrary, purely subjective, 
in short a judgment of value. The terms racial improvement and racial 
degeneration are meaningless when not based on definite plans for the 
future of mankind. 

It is true, civiIized man is adjusted to life in society and not to that 
of a hunter in virgin forests. 


I 66 Human Action 

The Fable of the Mystic Communion 

The praxeological theory of society is assailed by the fable of the mystic 

communion. 

Society, assert the supporters of this doctrine, is not the product of man's 
purposeful action; it is not cooperation and division of tasks. It stems from 
unfathomable depths, from an urge ingrained in man's essential nature. It 
is, says one group, engrossment by the Spirit which is Divine Reality and 
participation, by virtue of a unio mystica, in God's power and love. An- 
other group sees society as a biological phenomenon; it is the work of the 
voice of the blood, the bond uniting the offspring of common ancestors 
with these ancestors and with one another, and the mystical harmony be- 
tween the ploughman and the soil he tilIs. 

That such psychical phenomena are really felt is true. There are people 
who experience the unio mystica and place this experience above every- 
thing else, and there are men who are convinced that they hear the voice 
of the bIood and smell with heart and sou1 the unique scent of the cherished 
soil of their country. The mystical experience and the ecstatic rapture are 
facts which psychology must consider real, like any other psychical 
phenomenon. The error of the communion-doctrines does not consist in 
their assertion that such phenomena really occur, but in the belief that they 
are primary facts not dependent on any rational consideration. 

The voice of the blood which brings the father close to his child was not 
heard by those savages who did not know the causal relation benvcen 
cohabitation and pregnancy. Today, as this relation is known to every- 
body, a man who has full confidence in his wife's fidelity may perceive it. 
But if there are doubts concerning the wife's fidelity, the voice of the blood 
is of no use. hTobody ever ventured to assert that doubts concerning 
paternity could be resolved by the voice of the blood. A mother who has 
kept watch over her child since its birth can hear the voice of the blood. If 
she loses touch with the infant at an early date, she may later identify it 
by some bodily marks, for instance those moles and scars which once were 
popular with novel writers. But thc blood is mute if such observations and 
the conclusions derived from them do not make it speak. The voice of the 
blood, contend the German racists, mysteriously unifies all members of 
the German people. But anthropology reveals the fact that the German 
nation is a mixture of the descendants of various races, subraces, and strains 
and not a homogeneous stock descended from a common ancestry. The 
recently germanized Slav who has only a short time since changed his 
paternal family name for a German-sounding name believes that he is sub- 
stantially attached to all Germans. But he does not experience any such 
inner urge impelling him to join the ranks of his brothers or cousins who 
remained Czechs or Poles. 

The voice of the blood is not an original and primordial phenomenon. 
It is prompted by rational considerations. Because a man believes that he is 
related to other people by a common ancestry, he develops those feelings 


Hzmun Society 

and sentiments which are poetically described as the voice of the blood. 

The same is true with regard to religious ecstasy and mysticism of the 
soil. The unio mystica of the devout mystic is conditioned by familiarity 
with the basic teachings of his religion. Only a man who has learned about 
the greatness and glory of God can experience direct communion with 
Him. Mysticism of the soil is connected with the development of definite 
geopolitical ideas. Thus it may happen that inhabitants of the plains or the 
seashore include in the image of the soil with which they claim to be fer- 
vently joined and united, mountain districts which are unfamiliar to them 
and to whose conditions they could not adapt themselves, only because 
this territory belongs to the political body of which they are members, or 
would like to be members. On the other hand they often fail to include in 
this image of the soil whose voice they claim to hear, neighboring areas of 
a geographic structure very similar to that of their own country if these 
areas happen to belong to a foreign nation. 

The various members of a nation or linguistic group and the clusters they 
form are not always united in friendship and good will. The history of 
every nation is a record of mutual dislike and even hatred between its sub- 
divisions. Think of the English and the Scotch, the Yankees and the 
Southerners, the Prussians and the Bavarians. It was ideologies that over-
came such animosities and inspired all members of a nation or linguistic 
group with those feelings of community and belonging together which 
present-day nationalists consider a natural and original phenomenon. 

The mutual sexual attraction of male and female is inherent in man's 

animal nature and independent of any thinking and theorizing. It is per- 

missible to call it original, vegetative, instinctive, or mysterious; there is no 

harm in asserting metaphorically that it makes one being out of two. We 

may call it a mystic communion of two bodies, a community. However, 

neither cohabitation, nor what precedes it and follows, generates social 

cooperation and societal modes of life. The animals too join together in 

mating, but they have not developed social relations. Family life is not 

merely a product of sexual intercourse. It is by no means natural and 

necessary that parents and children live togethcr in the way in which they 

do in the family. The mating relation need not result in a family organiza- 

tion. The human family is an outcome of thinking, planning, and acting. 

It is this very fact which distinguishes it radically from those animal 

groups which we call per analogiam animal families. 

The mystical experience of communion or community is not the source 

of societal relations, but their product. 

The counterpart of the fable of the mystical communion is the fable of 

a natural and original repulsion between races or nations. It is asserted that 

an instinct teaches man to distinguish congeners from strangers and to de- 

test the latter. Scions of noble races abominate any contact with members 

of lower races. To refute this statement one need only mention the fact of 

racial mixture. As there are in present-day Europe no pure stocks, we must 

conclude that between members of the various stocks which once settled 


I 68 Human Action 

in that continent there was sexual attraction and not repulsion. Millions 
of mulattoes and other half-breeds are living counterevidence to the asser- 
tion that there exists a natural repulsion between the various races. 

Like the mystical sense of communion, racial hatred is not a natural 
phenomenon innate in man. It is the product of ideologies. But even if such 
a thing as a natural and inborn hatred between various races existed, it 
would not render social cooperation futile and would not invalidate 
Ricardo's theory of association. Social cooperation has nothing to do with 
personal love or with a general commandment to love one another. Pcople 
do not cooperate under the division of labor because they love or should 
love one another. They cooperate because this best serves their own in- 
terests. Neither love nor charity nor any other sympathetic sentiments but 
rightly understood selfishness is what originally impelled man to adjust 
himself to the requirements of society, to respect the rights and freedoms 
of his fellow men and to substitute peaceful collaboration for enmity and 
conflict. 

7. The Great Society 
Not every interhuman relation is a social relation. When groups 
of men rush upon one another in a war of outright extermination, 
when men fight against men as mercilessly as thcy crush pernicious 
animals and plants, there is, between the fightina .Parties, reciprocal 
effect and mutual relation, but no society. Society 1s joint action and 
cooperation in which each participant sees the other partner's success 
as a means for the attainment of his own. 

The struggles in which primitive hordes and tribes fought one an- 
other for watering places, hunting and fishing grounds, pastures and 
booty were such pitiless wars of annihilation. They were total wars. 
So in the nineteenth century were the first encounters of Europeans 
with the aborigines of territories newly made accessible. But al- 
ready in the primeval age, long before the time of which historical 
records convey information, another mode of procedure began to 
develop. People preserved even in warfare some rudiments of social 
relations previously established; in fighting against peoples with 
whom they never before had had any contact, they began to take 
into account the idea that between human beings, notwithstanding 
their immediate enmity, a later arrangement and cooperation is pos- 
sible. Wars were waged to hurt the foe; but the hostile acts were no 
longer merciless and pitiless in the full sense of these terms. The 
belligerents began to respect certain limits which in a struggle against 
men-as differentiated from that against beasts-should not be tran- 
scended. Above the implacable hatred and the frenzy of destruction 
and annihilation a societal element began to prevail. The idea emerged 


Hu7nan Society 

that every human adversary should be considered as a potential 
partner in a future cooperation, and that this fact should not be 
neglected in the conduct of military operations. War was no longer 
considered the norma1 state of interhuman relations. People recog- 
nized that pcaceful cooperation is the best means to carry on the strug- 
gle for biological survival. We may even say that as soon as people 
realized that it is more advantageous to enslave the defeated than to 
kill them, the warriors, while still fighting, gave thought to the after- 
math, the peace. Enslavement was by and large a preliminary step 
toward cooperation. 

The ascendancy of the idea that even in war not every act is to be 
considered permissible, that there are legitimatc and illicit acts of 
warfare, that there are laws, i.e., societal relationships which are 
above a11 nations, cvcn above those momentarily fighting one another, 
has finally established the Great Society embracing all men and all 
nations. The various regional societies were merged into one ecu- 
menical society. 

Belligerents who do not wage war savagely in the manner of 
beasts, but according to "human" and social rules of warfare, re-
nounce the use of some methods of destruction in order to attain the 
same concessions on the part of thcir foes. As far as such rules are 
complied with, social relations exist between the fighting parties. The 
hostile acts themselves are not only asocial, but antisocial. It is a 
mistake to define the term "social relationships" in such a way as to 
incIude actions which aim at other people's annihiIation and at the 
frustration of their acti~ns.~ 

Where the only relations between men 
are those directed at mutual detriment, there is neither society nor 
societal relations. 

Society is not merely interaction. There is interaction-reciprocal 
influence-between all parts of the universe: between the wolf and 
the sheep he devours; between the germ and the man it kills; between 
the falling stone and the thing upon which it falls. Society, on the 
other hand, always involves men acting in cooperation with other 
men in order to let all participants attain their own ends. 

8. The Instinct of Aggression and Destruction 
It has been asserted that man is a bcast of prey whose inborn 
natural instincts impel him to fight, to kill, and to destroy. Civiliza- 
tion, in creating unnatural humanitarian laxity which alienates man 

8. Such is the terminology used by Leapold von Wiese (Allgemeine Sodologie 
[Munich, 19241,I, 10ff.). 

Human Action 
from his animal origin, has tried to quell these impulses and appetites. 
It has made civilized man a decadent weakling who is ashamed of 
his animality and proudly calls his depravity true humaneness. In 
order to prevent further degeneration of the species man, it is im- 
perative to free him from the pcrnicious effects of civilization. For 
civilization is merely a cunning invention of inferior men. These 
underlings are too weak to be a match for the vigorous heroes, they 
are too cowardly to endure the well-deserved punishment of com-
plete annihilation, and they are too lazy and too insolent to serve the 
masters as slaves. Thus they have resorted to a tricky makeshift. They 
have reversed the eternal standards of value, absolutely fixed by the 
immutable laws of the universe; they have propagated a morality 
which calls their own inferiority virtue and the eminence of the 
noble heroes vice. This moral retkllion of the slaves niust be undone 
by a transvaluation of all values. The ethics of the slaves, this shameful 
product of the resentment of weaklings, must he entirely discarded; 
the ethics of the strong or, properly speaking, the nullification of 
any ethical restriction niust be substituted for it. Man must become 
a worthy scion of his ancestors, the noble beasts of days gone by. 
It is usual to call such doctrines social or sociological Darwinism. 
We need not decide here whether this terminology is appropriate 
or not. At any rate it is a mistake to assign the epithets evolutionary 
and biological to teachings which blithely disparage the whole of 
mankind's history from the ages in which man began to lift himself 
above the purely animal existence of his nonhuman ancestors as a 
continuous progression toward degeneration and decay. Biology does 
not provide any standard for the appraisal of changes occurring 
within living beings other than whether or not these changes suc- 
ceeded in adjusting the individuals to the conditions of their environ- 
ment and thercby in improving their chances in the struggle for 
survival. It is a fact that civilization, when judged from this point of 
view, is to be considered a benefit and not an evil. It has enabled man 
to hold his own in the struggle against all other living beings, both the 
big beasts of prey and the even more pernicious microbes; it has mul- 
tiplied man's means of sustenance; it has made the average man taller, 
more agile, and more versatile and it has stretched his average length 
of life; it has given man the uncontested mastery of the earth; it 
has multiplied population figures and raised the standard of living to 
a lcvcl ncver dreamed of by the crude cave dwellers of prehistoric 
ages. It is true that this evolution stunted the development of certain 
knacks and gifts which were once uscful in the struggle for survival 
and have lost their usefulness under changed conditions. On the other 


Human Society 

hand it developed other talents and skills which are indispensabIe 
for life within the frame of society. However, a biological and evo- 
lutionary view must not cavil at such changes. For primitive man 
hard fists and pugnacity were as useful as the ability to be clever at 
arithmetic and to spell correctly are for modern man. It is quite 
arbitrary and certainly contrary to any biological standard to call 
only those characteristics which were useful to primitive man natural 
and adequate to human nature and to condemn the talents and skills 
badly needed by civilized man as marks of degeneration and bio- 
logical deterioration. To advise man to return to the physical and 
intellectual features of his prehistoric ancestors is no more reasonable 
than to ask him to renounce his upright gait and to grow a tail again. 

It is noteworthy that the men who were foremost in extolling the 
eminence of the savage impulses of our barbarian forefathers were so 
frail that their bodies would not have come up to the requirements of 
"dangerous living." bTietzsche even before his mental breakdown was 
so sickly that the only climate he could stand was that of the Engadin 
valley and of some Italian districts. He would not have been in a 
position to accomplish his work if civilized society had not pro- 
tected his delicate nerves against the roughness of life. The apostles 
of violence wrote their books undcr the sheltering roof of "bourgeois 
security" which they derided and disparaged. They were free to pub- 
lish their incendiary sermons because the liberalism which they 
scorned safeguarded freedom of the press. They would have been 
desperate if they had had to forego the blessinis of the civilization 
scorned by their philosophy. And what a spectacle was that timid 
writer Gcorges Sorel, who went so far in his praise of brutality as to 
blame the modern system of education for weakening man's inborn 
tendencies toward violence! " 

One may admit that in primitive man the propensity for killing and 
destroying and the disposition for cruelty were innate. We may also 
assume that under the conditions of earlier ases the inclination for 
aggression and murder was favorable to the preservation of life. Man 
was once a brutal beast. (There is no need to investigate whether pre- 
historic man was a carnivore or a herbivore.) But one must not for- 
get that he was physicaHy a weak animal; he would not have been a 
match for the big beasts of prey if he had not been equipped with a 
peculiar weapon, reason. The fact that man is a reasonable being, that 
he therefore does not yield without inhibitions to every impulse, but 
arranges his conduct according to reasonable deliberation, must not 
be called unnatural from a zoologicaI point of view. Rational conduct

Human Action 

means that man, in face of the fact that he cannot satisfy all his im- 
pulses, desires, and appetites, foregoes the satisfaction of those which 
he considers less urgent. In order not to endanger the working of 
social cooperation man is forced to abstain from satisfying those de- 
sires whose satisfaction would hinder establishment of societal in- 
stitutions. There is no doubt that such a renunciation is painful. How- 
ever, man has made his choice. He has renounced the satisfaction of 
some desires incompatible with social life and has given priority to the 
satisfaction of those desires which can be realized only or in a morc 
plentiful way under a system of the division of labor. He has entered 
upon the way toward civilization, social cooperation, and wealth. 

This decision is not irrevocable and final. The choice of the fathers 
does not impair the sons' freedom to choose. They can reverse the 
resolution. Every day they can proceed to the transvaluation of values 
and prefer barbarism to civilization. or, as some authors say, the 
soul to the intellect, myths to reason, and violence to peace. But they 
must choose. It is impossible to have things incompatible with one 
another. 

Science, from the point of view of its valuational neutrality, does 
not blame the apostles of the gospel of violence for praising the 
frenzy of murder and the mad delights of sadism. VaIue judgments 
are subjective, and liberal society grants to everybody the right to 
express his sentiments freely. Civilization has not extirpated the origi- 
nal tendency toward aggression, bloodthirstiness, and cruelty which 
characterized primitive man. In many civilized men they are dormant 
and burst forth as soon as the restraints developed by civilization give 
way. Remember the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi concentration 
camps. The newspapers continually report abominable crimes 
manifesting the latent urges toward bestiality. The most popular 
novels and moving pictures are those dealing with bloodshed and 
violent acts. Bull fights and cock fights attract large crowds. 

If an author says: the rabble thirst for blood and I with them, he 
may be no less right than in asserting that primitive man too took 
delight in killing. But he errs if he passes over the fact that the satis- 
faction of such sadistic desires impairs the existence of society or if 
hc asserts that "true" civilization and the "good" society are an 
achievement of people blithely indulging in their passion for violence, 
murder, and cruelty, that the repression of the impulses toward bru- 
tality endangers mankind's evolution and that a substitution of bar- 
barism for humanitarianism would save man from degeneration. The 
social division of labor and cooperation rests upon conciliatory settle- 
ment of disputes. Not war, as Heraclitus said, but peace is the 


Human Society 

source of all socia1 relations. To man desires other than that for blood- 
shed are inborn. If he wants to satisfy these other desires, he must 
forego his urge to kill. He who wants to preserve life and health as 
well and as long as possible, must realize that respect for other people's 
lives and health better serves his aim than the opposite mode of con- 
duct. One may regret that such is the state of affairs. But no such 
lamentations can alter the hard facts. 

It is useless to censure this statement by referring to irrationality. 
All instinctive impulses defy examination by reason because reason 
deals only with the means for attaining ends sought and not with ulti- 
mate ends. But what distinguishes man from other animals is precisely 
that he does not yield without any will of his own to an instinctive 
urge. Man uses reason in order to choose between the incompatible 
satisfactions of conflicting desires. 

One must not tell the masses: Indulge in your urge for murder; it 
is genuinely human and best serves your well-being. One must tell 
them: If you satisfy your thirst for blood, you must forego many 
other desires. You want to eat, to drink, to live in fine homes, to clothe 
yourselves, and a thousand other things which only society can 
provide. You cannot have everything, you must choose. The danger- 
ous life and the frenzy of sadism may please you, but they are in- 
compatible with the security and plenty which you do not want to 
miss either. 

Praxeology as a science cannot encroach upon the individual's right 
to choose and to act. The final decisions rest with acting men, not 
with the theorists. Science's contribution to life and action does not 
consist in establishing vaIue judgments, but in clarification of the 
conditions under which man must act and in elucidation of the effects 
of various modes of action. It puts at the disposal of acting man all 
the information he needs in order to make his choices in full aware-
ness of their consequences. It prepares an estimate of cost and yield, as 
it were. It would fail in this task if it were to omit from this state- 
ment one of the items which could be of influence in people's choices 
and decisions. 

Current .Misinterpretations of Modern Natural 
Science, Especially of Darcinism 


Some present-day antiliberals, both of the right-wing and of the left- 
wing variety, base their teachings on misinterpretations of the achieve- 
ments of modern biology. 

I. Men are unequal. Eighteenth-century liberalism and likewise present- 
day egalitarianism start from the "self-evident truth" that "all men are 

I74 Human Action 
created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain un- 
alienable Rights." However, say the advocates of a biological philosophy 
of society, natural science has demonstrated in an irrefutable way that men 
are different. There is no room left in the framework of an experimental 
observation of natural phenomena for such a concept as natural rights. 
Nature is unfeeling and insensible with regard to any being's life and happi- 
ness. h-ature is iron necessity and regularity. It is metaphysical nonsense to 
link together the "slippery" and vague notion of liberty and the unchange- 
able absolute laws of cosmic order. Thus the fundamental idea of liberalism 
is unmasked as a fallacy. 
Now it is true that the liberal and democratic movement of the eight- 
eenth and nineteenth centuries drew a great part of its strength from the 
doctrine of natural law and the innate imprescriptible rights of the in- 
dividual. These ideas, first developed by ancient philosophy and Jewish 
theology, permeated Christian thinking. Some anti-Catholic sects made 
them the focal point of their political programs. A long line of eminent 
philosophers substantiated them. They became popular and were the most 
powerful moving force in the prodemocratic evolution. They are still sup- 
ported today. Their advocates do not concern themselves with the incon- 
testable fact that God or nature did not create men equal since many are 
born hale and hearty while others are crippled and deformed. With them 
all differences between men are due to education, opportunity, and socia! 
institutions. 
But the teachings of utilitarian philosophy and cIassical economics have 
nothing at all to do with the doctrine of natural right. With them the only 
point that matters is social utility. They recommend popular government, 
private property, tolerance, and freedom not because they are natural and 
just, but because they are beneficial. The core of Ricardo's philosophy is 
the demonstration that social cooperation and division of labor between 
men who are in every regard superior and more efficient and men who are 
in every regard inferior and less efficient is beneficial to both groups. 
Bentharn, the radical, shouted: "Natural rights is simple nonsense: natural 
and imprescriptible rights, rhetorical nonsense." lo With him "the sole 
object of government ought to be the greatest happiness of the greatest 
possible number of the community." l1 Accordingly, in investigating what 
ought to be right he does not care about preconceived ideas concerning 
God's or nature's plans and intentions, forever hidden to mortal men; he 
is intent upon discovering what best serves the promotion of human wel- 
fare and happiness. Malthus showed that nature in limiting the means of 
subsistence does not accord to any living being a right of existence, and 
that by indulging heedlessly in the natural impulse of proliferation man 
would never have risen above the verge of starvation. He contended that 
human civilization and weI1-being could develop only to the extent that

Human Society 

man learned to rein his sexuaI appetites by moral restraint. The Utilitarians 
do not combat arbitrary government and privileges because they arc 
against natural law but because they are detrimental to prosperity. They 
recommend equality under the civil law not because men are equal but be- 
cause such a policy is beneficial to the commonweal. In rejecting the illu- 
sory notions of natural law and human equality modern biology only re- 
peated what the utilitarian champions of liberalism and democracy long 
before had taught in a much more persuasive way. It is obvious that no 
biological doctrine can ever invalidate what utilitarian philosophy says 
about the social utility of democratic government, private property, free- 
dom, and equality under the law. 

The present-day prevalence of doctrices approving social disintegration 
and violent conflict is not the result of an alleged adaptation of social phi- 
losophy to the findings of biology but of the almost universal rejection of 
utilitarian philosophy and economic theory. People have substituted an 
ideoIogy of irreconcilable class conflict and international conflict for the 
"orthodox" ideology of the harmony of the rightly understood, ix., long- 
run, interests of all individuals, social groups, and nations. Afen are fight- 
ing one another because they are convinced that the extermination and 
liquidation of adversaries is the only means of promoting their own well- 
being. 

2. The social implications of Darwinism. The theory of evolution as 
expounded by Darwin, says a school of social Darwinism, has clearly dem- 
onstrated that in nature there are no such things as peace and respect for 
the lives and welfare of others. In nature there is always struggle and 
merciless annihilation of the weak who do not succeed in defending them- 
selves. Liberalism's plans for eternal peace-both in domestic and in for- 
eign relations-are :he outcome of an illusory rationalis~n contrary to the 
natural order. 
However, the notion of the struggle for existence as Darwin borrowed it 
from Malthus and applied it in his theory, is to be understood in a meta- 
phorical sense. Its meaning is that a living being actively resists the forces 
detrimental to its own life. This resistance, if it is to succeed, must be ap-
propriate to the environmental conditions in which the being concerned 
has to hold its own. It need not always be a war of extermination such as in 
rhe reiarions between men and morbific microbes. Reason has demon- 
strated that, for man, the most adequate means of improving his condition 
is social cooperation and division of labor. They are man's foremost tool 
in his struggle for survival. But they can work only where there is peace. 
Wars, civil wars, and revolutions are detrinlental to man's success in the 
struggle for existence because they disintegrate the apparatus of social 
cooperation. 

3. Reason and rational behavior are unnatural. Christian theology dep- 
recated the animal functions of man's body and depicted the "soul" a4 
something outside of all biological phenomena. In an excessive reaction 
against this philosophy some moderns are prone to disparage everything

in which man differs from other animals. In their eyes human reason is in-
ferior to the animal instincts and impulses; it is unnatural and therefore 
bad. With them the terms rationalism and rational behavior have an op- 
probrious connotation. The perfect man, the real man, is a being who obeys 
his primordial instincts more than his reason. 


(Rectangle comment George Reisman

The obvious truth is that reason, man's most characteristic feature, is 
also a biological phenomcnon. It is neither lnorc nor less natural than any 
other feature of the species homo sapiens, for instance, the upright gait or 
the hairless skin. 


IX. THE ROLE OF IDEAS 
I. Human Reason 
EASON is man's particular and characteristic feature. There is no 
Rneed for praxeology to raise the question whether reason is a 
suitable tool for the cognition of ultimate and absolute truth. It 
deals with reason only as far as it enables man to act. 

All those objects which are the substratum of human sensation, 
perception, and observation also pass before the senses of animals. 
But man alone has the faculty of transforming sensuous stimuli into 
observation and experience. And man alone can arrange his various 
observations and experiences into a coherent system. 

Action is preceded by thinking. Thinking is to deliberate before- 
hand over future action and to reflect afterward upon past action. 
Thinking and acting are inseparable. Every action is always based 
on a definite idea about causal relations. He who thinks a causal rela- 
tion thinks a theorem. Action without thinking, practice without 
theory are unimaginable. The reasoning may be faulty and the theory 
incorrect; but thinking and theorizing are not lacking in any action. 
On the other hand thinking is always thinking of a potential action. 
Even he who thinks of a pure theory assumes that the theory is 
correct, i.e., that action complying with its content would resuit in 
an effect to be expected from its teachings. It is of no relevance for 
logic whether such action is feasible or not. 

It is always the individual who thinks. Society does not think 
any more than it eats or drinks. The evolution of human reasoning 
from the nahe thinking of primitive man to the more subtle think- 
ing of modern scicnce took place within society. However, thinking 
itself is always an achievement of individuals. here is joint action, 
but no joint thinking. There is only tradition which preserves thoughts 
and communicates them to others as a stimulus to their thinking. 
However, man has no means of appropriating the thoughts of his 
precursors other than to think them over again. Then, of course, lie 
is in a position to proceed farther on the basis of his forerunners' 
thoughts. The foremost vehicle of tradition is the word. Thinking is 
linked up with langnaage and vice versa. Concepts are embodied in 
terms. Language is a tool of thinking as it is a tool of social action. 


Human Action 

The history of thought and ideas is a discourse carried on from 
generation to generation. The thinking of later ages grows out of 
the thinking of earlier ages. Without the aid of this stimulation in- 
tellectual progress would have been impossible. The continuity of 
human evolution, sowing for the offspring and harvesting on land 
cleared and tilled by the ancestors, manifests itself also in the history 
of science and ideas. We have inherited from our forefathers not 
only a stock of products of various orders of goods which is the 
source of our material wealth; we have no less inherited ideas and 
thoughts, theories and technologies to which our thinking owes its 
productivity. 

But thinking is always a manifestation of individuals. 

2. World View and Ideology 
The theories directing action are often imperfect and unsatisfac- 
tory. They may be contradictory and unfit to be arranged into a 
cornprehensive and coherent system. 

If we look at all the theorems and theories guiding the conduct of 
certain individuals and groups as a coherent complex and try to ar- 
range them as far as is feasible into a system, i.e., a cornprehensive body 
of knowledge, we may speak of it as a world view. A world view 
is, as a theory, an interpretation of all things, and as a precept for 
action, an opinion concerning the best means for removing uneasiness 
as much as possible. A world view is thus, on the one hand, an expla- 
nation of all phenomena and, on the other hand, a technology, both 
these terms being taken in their broadest sense. Religion, metaphysics, 
and philosophy aim at providing a world view. They interpret the 
universe and they advise men how to act. 

The concept of an ideology is narrower than that of a world view. 
In speaking of ideology we have in view only human action and social 
cooperation and disregard the problems of metaphysics, religious 
dogma, the natural sciences, and the technoiogies derived from them. 
Ideology is the totality of our doctrines concerning individual con- 
duct and social relations. Both, world view and ideology, go beyond 
the limits imposed upon a purely neutral and academic study of things 
as they are. They are not only scientific theories, but also doctrines 
about the ought, i.e., about the ultimate ends which man should ailn 
at in his earthly concerns. 

Asceticism teaches that the only means open to man for removing 

pain and for attaining complete quietude, contentment, and happiness 

is to turn away from earthly concerns and to live without bothering 


The Role of Ideas I79 

about worldly things. There is no salvation other than to renounce 
striving after material well-being, to endure submissively the adversi- 
ties of the earthly pilgrimage and to dedicate oneself exclusively to 
the preparation for eternal bliss. However, the number of those who 
consistently and unswervingly comply with the principles of asceti- 
cism is so small that it is not easy to instance more than a few names. 
It seems that the complete passivity advocated by asceticism is 
contrary to nature. Thc enticement of life triumphs. The ascetic 
principles have been adulterated. Even the most saintly hermits made 
concessions to lifc and earthly concerns which did not agree with 
their rigid principles. But as soon as a man takes into account any 
earthly concerns, and substitutes for purely vegetative ideals an 
acknowlcdgmcnt of worldly things, however conditioned and in- 
compatible with the rest of his professed doctrine, he bridges over the 
gulf which separated him from those who say yes to the striving after 
earthly ends. Then he has something in common with everyone 
else. 

Human thoughts about things of which neither pure reasoning nor 
experience provides any knowledge may differ so radically that no 
agreement can be reached. In this sphere in which the free reverie 
of the mind is restricted neither by logical thinking nor by sensory 
experience man can give vent to his individuality and subjectivity. 
Nothing is more personal than thc notions and images about the 
transcendent. Linguistic terms are unable to communicate what is 
said about the transcendent; one can ncver establish whethcr the 
hearer conceives them in the same way as the speaker. With regard 
to things beyond there can be no agrecment. Religious wars are the 
most terrible wars because they are waged without any prospect of 
conciliation. 

But where earthly things are involved, the natural affinity of all 
men and the identity of thc biologicaI conditions for the preservation 
of their livcs come into play. The higher productivity of cooperation 
under division of iibor makes soclety the foremost means of every 
individual for the attainment of his own ends whatever they may be. 
The maintenance and further intcnsification of social cooperation 
become a concern of everybody. Every world view and every ideol- 
ogy which is not entirely and unconditionally committed to the prac- 
tice of asceticism and to a lifc in anchoritic reclusion must pay heed 
to the fact that society is the great means for the attainment of earthly 
ends. But then a common ground is won to clear the way for an agree-
ment concerning minor social problems and the details of society's 
organization. Howcver various ideologies may conflict with one 


I 80 Human Action 

another, they harmonize in one point, in the acltnowledgment of life 
in society. 

People fail sometimes to see this fact because in dealing with 
philosophies and ideologies they look more at what these doctrines 
assert with regard to transcendent and unknowable things and less 
at their statements about action in this w-orld. Between various parts 
of an ideological system there is often an unbridgeable gulf. For 
acting man only those teachings are of real importance which result 
in precepts for action, not those doctrines which are purely academic 
and do not apply to conduct within the frame of social cooperation. 
We may disregard the philosophy of adamant and consistent asceti- 
cism because such a rigid asceticism must ultimately result in the 
extinction of its supporters. All other ideologies, in approving of the 
search for the necessities of life, arc forced in some measure to take 
into account the fact that division of labor is more productive than 
isolated work. They thus admit the need for social cooperation. 

Praxeology and economics are not qualified to deal with the tran- 
scendent and metaphysical aspects of any doctrine. But, on the other 
hand, no appeal to any religious or metaphysical dogmas and creeds 
can invalidate the theorems and theories concerning social coopera- 
tion as developed by logically correct praxeological reasoning. If a 
philosophy has admitted the necessity of societal links between men, 
it has placed itseIf, as far as problems of social action come into play, 
on ground from which there is no escape into personal convictions 
and professions of faith not liable to a thorough examination by 
methods of science. 

This fundamental fact is often ignored. People believe that differ- 
ences in world view create irreconcilable conflicts. The basic antag- 
onisms between parties committed to different world views, it is con- 
tended, cannot be settled by compromise. They stem from the deepest 
recesses of the human soul and are expressive of a man's innate com- 
munion with supernatural and eternal forces. There can never be any

l' 


However, if we pass in review the programs of all parties-both 
the cleverly elaborated and publicized programs and those to which 
the parties really cling when in power-we can easily discover the 
fallacy of this interpretation. All present-day political parties strive 
after the earthly well-being and prosperity of their supporters. They 
promise that they will render economic conditions more satisfactory 
to their followers. With regard to this issue there is no difference 
between the Roman Catholic Church and the various Protestant de- 
nominations as far as they intervene in political and social questions, 


The Role of Ideas 

between Christianity and the non-Christian religions, between the 
advocates of economic freedom and the various brands of !Marxian 
materialism, between nationalists and internationalists, between racists 
and the friends of interracial peace. It is true, that many of these 
parties believe that their own group cannot prosper except at the 
expense of other groups, and even go so far as to consider the com- 
plete annihilation of other groups or their enslavement as the neces- 
sary condition of their own group's prosperity. Yet, extermination or 
enslavement of others is for them not an ultimate end, but a means 
for the attainment of what they aim at as an ultimate end: their own 
group's flowering. If they were to learn that their own designs are 
guided by spurious theories and would not bring about the beneficia1 
results expected, they would change their programs. 

The pompous statemcnts which people make about things un-
knowable and beyond the power of the human mind, their cosmoI- 
ogies, world vicws, religions, mysticisms, metaphysics, and conceptual 
phantasies differ widely from one another. But the practical essence 
of their ideologies, i.e., their teachings dealing with the ends to be 
aimed at in earthly lifc and with the means for the attainment of 
these ends, show much uniformity. Therc are, to be sure, differences 
and antagonisms both with rcgard to ends and means. Yet the differ- 
ences with rcgard to ends are not irreconcilable; they do not hinder 
cooperation and amicable arrangements in the sphere of social action. 
As far as they concern means and ways only they are of a purely 
technicaI character and as such open to examination by rational meth- 
ods. When in the heat of party conflicts one of the factions declares: 
"Here we cannot go on in our negotiations with you because we 
are faced with a question touching upon our world view; on this 
point we must be adamant and must cling riaidly to our principles 

P

whatever may result," one need only scrutin~ze matters more care- 
fully to realize that such declarations describe the antagonism as more 
pointed than it really is. In fact, for all parties committed to pursuit 
of the people's earthly welfare and thus approving social cooperation, 
questions of social oiganization and the conduct of social action are 
not problems of ultimate principles and of world views, but ideolog- 
ical issues. They are technical problems with regard to which some 
arrangement is always possible. No party would wittingly prefer 
social disintegration, anarchy, and a return to primitive barbarism to 
a solution which must be bought at the price of the sacrifice of some 
ideological points. 

In party programs these technical issues are, of course, of primary 

importance. A party is committed to certain means, it recommends 


Human Action 

certain methods of political action and rejects utterly all other meth- 
ods and policies as inappropriate. A party is a body which combines 
a11 those eager to employ the same means for common action. The 
principle which differentiates men and integrates parties is the choice 
of means. Thus for the party as such the means chosen are essential. 
A party is doomed if the futility of the means recommended becomes 
obvious. Party chicfs whose prestige and political career are bound 
up with the party's program may have ample reasons for withdraw- 
ing its principles from unrestricted discussion; they may attribute 
to them the character of ultimate ends which must not be questioned 
because they are based on a world view. But for the people as whose 
mandataries the party chiefs pretend to act, for the voters whom they 
want to enlist and for whose votes they canvass, things ogcr another 
aspect. They have no objection to scrutinizing every point of a 
party's program. 171eylook upon such a program only as a recom-
mendation of means fdr the attainment of their own ends, viz., earthly 
well-being. 

What divides those parties which one calls today world view 
parties, i.c., parties committed to basic philosophical decisions about 
ultimate ends, is only seeming disagreement with regard to ultimate 
ends. Their antagonisms refer either to religious creeds or to prob- 
lems of international relations or to the problem of ownership of the 
rneans of production or to problems of political organization. It can 
be shown that all these controvcrsics concern means and not uItimate 
ends. 

Let us begin with the problems of a nation's political organiza- 
tion. There are supporters of a democratic system of government, of 
hereditary monarchy, of the rule of a self-styled elite and of Caesarist 
dictat0rship.l It is true that these programs are often recommended 
by reference to divine institutions, to the eternal laws of the uni- 
verse, to the natural order, to the inevitable trend of historical evolu- 
tion, and to other objects of transcendent knowledge. But such state- 
ments are rnerely incidental adornment. In appealing to the electorate, 
the parties advance other arguments. They are eager to show that 
the system they support will succeed better than those advocated by 
other parties in realizing those ends which the citizcns aim at. They 
specify the beneficial resuIts achieved in the past or in other countries; 
they disparage the other parties' programs by relating their failures. 
They resort both to pure reasoning and to an interpretation of his- 
torical experience in order to demonstrate the superiority of their 

I. Caesarism is today exemplified by the Bolshevik, Fascist, or Nazi type of 
dictatorship. 

The Role of Ideas 

own proposals and the futility of those of their adversaries. Their 
main argument is always: the political system we support will render 
vou more prosperous and more content. 

In the field of society's economic organization there are the liberals 
advocating privatc ownership of the means of production, the so- 
cialists advocating public ownership of the means of production, and 
the interventionists advocating a third system which, they contend, 
is as far from socialism as it is from capitalism. In the clash of these 
partics there is again much talk about basic philosophical issues. 
People speak of true liberty, equaIity, social justice, the rights of the 
individual, community, solidarity, and humanitarianism. But each 
party is intent upon proving by ratiocination and by referring to 
historical experience that only the system it recommends will make 
the citizcns prosperous and satisfied. They tell the people that realiza- 
tion of their program will raise the standard of living to a higher level 
than realization of any other party's program. They insist upon the 
expediency of their plans and upon their utility. It is obvious that 
they do not diffcr from one another with regard to cnds but only as 
to means. They all pretend to aim at the highest material welfare 
for the majority of citizens. 

The nationalists strcss the point that there is an irreconcilable con- 
flict bctween the intercsts of various nations, but that, on the other 
hand, the rightly understood interests of all the citizens within the 
nation arc harmonious. A nation can prosper only at the expense of 
other nations; the individual citizen can fare well only if his nation 
flourishes. The liberals have a different opinion. They believe that 
the interests of various nations harmonize no less than those of the 
various groups, classes, and strata of individuals within a nation. Thcy 
believe that peaceful international cooperation is a more appropriate 
means than conflict for attainment of the end which they and the 
nationalists are both aiming at: their own nation's welfare. Thcy do 
not, as thc nationalists charge, advocate peace and free trade in order 
to betray their own nation's interests to those of foreigners. On the 
contrary, thcy consider peace and free trade the best means to 
make their own nation wealthy. What separates the free traders from 
the nationalists is not ends, but the means recommended for attain- 
ment of the cnds common to both. 

Dissension with regard to religious creeds cannot be settled by 
rational methods. Religious conflicts are essentially implacable and 
irreconcilable. Yet as soon as a religious community enters the ficld 
of political action and tries to deal with problems of social organiza- 
tion, it is bound to take into account earthly concerns, however this

may conflict with its dogmas and articles of faith. No religion in its 
exoteric activities ever ventured to tell people frankly: The realiza- 
tion of our plans for social organization will make you poor and im- 
pair your earthly well-being. Those consistently committed to a life 
of poverty withdrew from the political scene and flcd into anchoritic 
scclusion. But churches and religious communities which have aimed 
at making converts and at influencing political and social activities 
of their followers have espoused the principles of secular conduct. In 
dealing with questions of man's earthly pilgrimage they hardly differ 
from any other political party. In canvassing, they emphasize the 
material advantages which they have in store for their brothers in 
faith more than bliss in the beyond. 

Only a world view whose supporters renounce any earthly activity 
whatever could neglect to pay heed to the rational considerations 
which show that social cooperation is the great means for the attain- 
ment of all human ends. Because man is a social animal that can thrive 
only within society, all ideologies are forced to acknowledge the 
preeminent importance of social cooperation. They must aim at the 
most satisfactory organization of society and must approve of man's 
concern for an improvement of his material well-being. Thus they 
all place themselves upon a common ground. They are separated from 
one another not by world views and transcendent issues not subject 
to reasonable discussion, but by problems of means and ways. Such 
ideological antagonisms are open to a thorough scrutiny by the 
scientific methods of praxeology and economics. 

The Fight Against Error 

A critical examination of the philosophical systems constructed by man- 
kind's great thinkers has very often revealed fissures and flaws in the im- 
pressivc structure of those seemingly consistent and coherent bodies of 
comprehensive thought. Even the genius in drafting a world view some- 
times fails to avoid contradictions and fallacious syllogisms. 

The ideologies accepted by public opinion are still more infected by the 
shortcomings of the human mind. They are mostly an ecIectic juxtaposi- 
tion of ideas utterly incompatible with one another. They cannot stand a 
logical examination of their content. Their inconsistencies are irreparable 
and defy any attempt to combine their various parts into a system of ideas 
compatible with one another. 

Some authors try to justify the contradictions of generally accepted 
ideologies by pointing out the alleged advantages of a compromise, how- 
ever unsatisfactory from the logical point of view, for the smooth function- 
ing of interhuman relations. They refer to the popular fallacy that life and 
reality are "not logical"; they contend that a contradictory system may 


The Role of Ideas 

prove its expediency or even its truth by working satisfactorily while a 
logically consistent system would result in disaster. There is no need to 
refute anew such popular errors. Logical thinking and real life are not 
two separate orbits. Logic is for man the only means to master the problems 
of reality. What is contradictory in theory, is no less contradictory in 
reality. No ideological inconsistency can provide a satisfactory, i.e., work- 
ing, solution for the problems offered by the facts of the world. The only 
effect of contradictory ideologies is to conceal the real problems and thus 
to prevent people from finding in time an appropriate policy for solving 
them. Inconsistent ideologies may sometimes postpone the emergence of a 
manifest conflict. But they certainly aggravate the evils which they mask 
and rcnder a final solution more difficult. They multiply the agonies, they 
intensify the hatreds, and make peaceful settlement impossible. It is a 
serious blunder to consider ideological contradictions harmless or even 
beneficial. 

The main objective of praxeology and economics is to substitute consist- 
ent correct ideologies for the contradictory tenets of popular eclecticism. 
Therc is no other means of preventing social distintegration and of safe- 
guarding the steady improvement of human conditions than those provided 
by reason. Men must try to think through all the problems involved up ta 
the point beyond which a human mind cannot proceed farther. They must 
never acquiesce in any solutions conveyed by older generations, they must 
always question anew every theory and every theorem, they must never 
relax in their endeavors to brush away fallacies and to find the best possible 
cognition. They must fight error by unmasking spurious doctrines and by 
expounding truth. 

The problems involved are purely intellectual and must be dealt with 
as such. It is disastrous to shift them to the moral sphere and to dispose of 
supporters of opposite ideologies by calling them villains. It is vain to in- 
sist that what we are aiming at is good and what our adversaries want is 
bad. The question to be solved is precisely what is to be considered as good 
and what as bad. The rigid dogmatism peculiar to religious groups and to 
Marxism results only in irreconcilable conflict. It condemns beforehand all 
dissenters as evildoers, it calls into question their good faith, it asks them 
to surrender unconditionally. No social cooperation is possible where such 
an attitude prevails. 

No better is the propensity, very popular nowadays, to brand supporters 

of other ideologies as lunatics. Psychiatrists are vague in drawing a line 

between sanity and insanity. It would be preposterous for laymen to inter- 

fere with this fundamental issue of psychiatry. However, it is clear that if 

the mere fact that a man shares erroneous views and acts according to his 

errors qualifies him as mentally disabled, it would be very hard to discover 

an individual to which the epithet sane or normal could be attributed. Then 

we are bound to call the past generations lunatic because their ideas about 

the problems of the natural sciences and concomitantly their techniques 

differed from ours. Coming generations will call us lunatics for the same 


I 86 Human Action 

reason. Man is liable to error. If to err were the characteristic feature of 

mental disability, thcn everybody shouId be caIled mentally disabled. 

Neither can the fact that a man is at variance with the opinions held by 

the majority of his contemporaries qualify him as a lunatic. Were Coperni- 

cus, Galileo and Lavoisier insane? It is the regular course of history that a 

man conceives new ideas, contrary to those of other people. Some of these 

ideas are later embodied in the system of knowledge accepted by public 

opinion as true. Is it permissible to apply the epithet "sane" only to boors 

who never had ideas of their own and to deny it to all innovators? 

The procedure of some contemporary psychiatrists is really outrageous. 
'They are utterly ignorant of the theories of praxeoIogy and economics. 
Their familiarity with present-day ideologies is superficial and uncritical. 
Yet they blithely call the supporters of some ideologies paranoid per- 

sons. 

There are men who are commonly stigmatized as monetary cranks. The 
monetary crank suggests a method for making everybody prosperous by 
monetary measures. His plans are illusory. However, they are thc consist- 
ent application of a monctary ideology entirely approved by contempo- 
rary public opinion and espoused by the policies of almost all governments. 
The objections raised against these ideological crrors by the economists 
are not taken into account by the governments, political parties, and the 

press. 

It is generally believed by those unfamiliar with economic theory that 
credit expansion and an increase in the quantity of money in circulation 
are efficacious means for lowering the rate of interest permanently below 
the height it would attain on a nonrnanipulatcd capital and loan market. 
This theory is uttcrly illu~ory.~ 

But it guides the monetary and credit 
policy of almost every contemporary government. Now, on the basis of 
this vicious ideology, no valid objection can be raised against the plans 
advanced by Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Ernest Solvay, Clifford Hugh 
Douglas and a host of other would-be reformers. They are only more 
consistent than other people are. They want to reduce the rate of interest 
to zero and thus to abolish altogether the scarcity of "capital." He who 
wants to refutc them must attack the theories underlying the monetary and 
credit policies of the great nations. 

The psychiatrist may object that what characterizes a man as a lunatic 
is precisely the fact that he lacks moderation and goes to extremes. While 
normal man is judicious enough to restrain himself, the paranoid person 
goes beyond all bounds. This is quite an unsatisfactory rejoinder. All the 
arguments advanced in favor of the thesis that the rate of interest can be 
reduced by credit expansion from j or 4 per cent to 3 or 2 per cent are 
equally valid for a reduction to zero. The "monetary cranks" are certainly 

from the point of view of the monetary fallacies approved by popular 
opinion. 

1. Cf. below, Chapter XX. 

The Role of ldeas 

There are psychiatrists who call the Germans who espoused the princi- 
ples of Sazism lunatics and want to cure them by therapeutic procedures. 
Here again we are faced with the same problem. The doctrines of hTazism 
are vicious, but they do not essentially disagree with the ideoIogics of 
socialism and nationalism as approved by other peoples' public opinion. 
What characterized the Kazis was only the consistent application of these 
ideologies to the special conditions of Germany. Like all other contem- 
porary nations the Kazis desired government control of business and 
economic self-sufficiency, i.e., autarky, for their own nation. The distinc- 
tive mark of their policy was that they refused to acquiesce in the disad- 
vantages which the acceptance of the same system by other nations would 
impose upon them. They were not prepared to be forever "imprisoned," 
as they said, within a comparatively overpopulated area in which physical 
conditions render the productivity of labor lower than in other countries. 
They believed that their nation's great population figures, the strategically 
propitious geographic situation of their country, and the inborn vigor and 
gallantry of their armed forces provided them with a good chance to 
remedy by aggression the evils they deplored. 

Now, whoever accepts the ideology of nationalism and socialism as true 
and as the standard of his own nation's policy, is not in a position to refute 
the conclusions drawn from them by the Nazis. The only way for a refuta- 
tion of Nazism left for foreign nations which have espoused these two 
principles is to defeat the Nazis in war. And as long as thc ideology of 
socialism and nationalism is supreme in the world's public opinion, the 
Germans or other peoples will try again to succeed by aggression and con- 
quest, should the opportunity ever be offered to them. There is no hope 
of eradicating the aggression mentality if one does not explode entirely 
the ideological fallacies from which it stems. This is not a task for psychia- 
trists, but for economist^.^ 

What is wrong with the Germans is certainly not that thcy do not com- 
ply with the teachings of the Gospels. No nation ever did. With the excep- 
tion of the small and uninfluential groups of the Friends practically all 
Christian churches and sects blessed the arms of warriors. The most ruthless 
among the older German conquerors were the Teutonic Knights who 
fought in the name of the Cross. The source of present-day German ag-
gressiveness is the very fact that the Germans have discarded liberal 
philosophy and substituted the ideology of nationalism and socialism for 
the liberal principles of free trade and peace. If mankind does not return 
to the ideas today disparaged as "orthodox," "Manchester philosophy," 
and "laissez faire," the only method to prevent a new aggression is to 
render the Germans innocuous by depriving them of the means of waging 
war. 

Man has only one tool to fight error: reason.

Human Action 

3. Might 
Society is a product of human action. Human action is directed 
by ideologies. Thus society and any concrete order of social affairs 
are an outcome of ideologies; ideologies are not, as Marxism asserts, 
a product of a certain state of social affairs. To be sure, human 
thoughts and ideas are not the achievement of isolated individuals. 
Thinking too succeeds only through the cooperation of the thinkers. 
No individual would make headway in his reasoning if he were under 
the necessity of starting from the beginning. A man can advance in 
thinking only because his efforts are aided by those of older gener- 
ations who have formed the tools of thinking, the concepts and 
terminologies, and have raised the problems. 

Any given social order was thought out and designed before it 
could be realized. This temporal and logical precedence of the 
ideological factor does not imply the proposition that people draft 
a complete plan of a social system as the utopians do. What is and 
must be thought out in advance is not the concerting of individual's 
actions into an integrated system of social organization, but the actions 
of individuals with regard to their fellow men and of already formed 
groups of individuals with regard to other groups. Before a man 
aids his fellow in cutting a tree, such cooperation must be thought 
out. Before an act of barter takes place, the idea of mutual exchange 
of goods and services must be conceived. It is not necessary 
that the individuals concerned become aware of the fact that such 
mutuality results in the establishment of social bonds and in the 
emergence of a social system. The individual does not plan and exe- 
cute actions intended to construct society. His conduct and the cor- 
responding conduct of others generate social bodies. 

Any existing state of social affairs is the product of ideologies pre- 
viousiy thought out. Within society new ideologies may emerge and 
may supersede oider ideoiogies and thus transform the sociai system, 
However, society is always the creation of ideologies temporally and 
logically anterior. Action is always directed by ideas; it realizes what 
previous thinking has designed. 

If we hypostatize or anthropomorphize the notion of ideology, 
we may say that ideologies have might over men. Might is the faculty 
or power of directing actions. As a rule one says only of a man or 
of groups of men that they are mighty. Then the definition of might 
is: might is the power to direct other people's actions. He who is 
mighty, owes his might to an ideology. Only ideologies can convey 


The Role of ldeas 

to a man the power to influence other people's choices and conduct. 
One can become a leader only if one is supported by an ideology 
which makes other ~eople tractable and accommodating. Might is 
thus not a physical and tangible thing, but a moral and spiritual 
phenomenon. A king's might rests upon the recognition of the mon- 
archical ideology on the part of his subjects. 

He who uses his might to mn the state, i.e., the social apparatus 
of coercion and compulsion, rules. RuIe is the exercise of might in 
the political body. Rule is always based upon might, i.e., the power 
to direct other people's actions. 

Of course, it is possible to establish a government upon the violent 
oppression of reluctant people. It is the characteristic mark of state 
and government that they apply violent coercion or the threat of 
it against those not prepared to yield voluntarily. Yet such violent 
oppression is no less founded upon ideological might. He who 
wants to apply violence needs the vohntary cooperation of some 
people. An individual entirely dependent on himself can never rule 
by means of physical violence He needs the ideological sup- 
port of a group in order to subduc other groups. The tyrant must 
have a retinue of partisans who obey his orders of their own accord. 
Their spontaneous obedience provides him with the apparatus he 
needs for the conquest of other people. Whether or not he succeeds 
in making his sway last depends on the numerical relation of the two 
groups, those who support him voluntarily and those whom he beats 
into submission. Though a tyrant may temporarily rule through a 
minority if this minority is armed and the majority is not, in the long 
run a minority cannot keep the majority in subservience. The op- 
pressed will rise in rebeIlion and cast off the yoke of tyranny. 

A durabIe system of government must rest upon an ideology ac- 

knowledged by the majority. The "real" factor, thc "real forces" that 

are the foundation of goverhment and convey to the rulers the power 

to use violence against renitent minority groups are essentially ideo- 

logical, moral, and spiritual. Rulers who failed to recognize this 

first principle of government and, relying upon the alleged irresist- 

ibility of their armed troops, disdained the spirit and ideas, have 

finally been overthrown by the assault of their adversaries. The in- 

terpreration of might as a "real" factor not dependent upon ideologies, 

q~~ite

common to many political and historical books, is erroneous. 
The term Realpolitik makes sense only if used to signify a policy 
taking account of generally accepted ideologies as contrasted with 

4. A gangster may overpower a weaker or unarmed fellow. However, this has 
nothing to do with life in society. It is an isolated antisocial occurrence. 

Human Action 
a policy based upon ideologies not sufficiently acknowledged and 
thcrcfore unfit to support a durabIe system of government. 
He who interprets tnight as physical or "real" power to carry on 
and considers violent action as the very foundation of government, 
sees conditions from the narrow point of view of subordinate officers 
in charge of sections of an army or police force. To these subordi- 
nates a definite task within the framework of the ruling ideology 
is assigned. Thcir chiefs commit to their care troops which are not 
only equippcd, armed, and organized for combat, but no less imbued 
with the spirit which makes them obey the orders issued. The corn- 
manders of such subdivisions consider this moral factor a matter of 
course bccause they themselves are animated by the same spirit and 
cannot cven imagine a different ideology. The power of an ideology 
consists precisely in the fact that people submit to it without any 
wavering and scruples. 
However, things are different for the head of thc government. He 
must aim at preservation of thc morale of the armed forces and of the 
loyalty of the rest of the population. For these moral factors are the 
only "real" elemcnts upon which continuance of his mastcry rcsts. 
His power du-indles if the ideology that supports it disappears. 
Minorities too can sometimes conquer by means of superior mili- 
tary skill and can thiis establish minority rule. But such an order of 
things cannot endure. If the victorious conquerors do not succeed 
in subsequently converting the system of rule by violence into a 
system of rule by ideological consent on the part of those ruled, they 
will succumb in ncw str~zggles. A11 victorious minorities who have 
estalJished a lasting system of government have made their sway 
durable by means of a belated ideological ascendancy. They have 
lcgitimized their own supremacy cithcr by submitting to the ideologies 
of the defeated or by transforming them. Where neither of these two 
things tool: placc, the oppressed many dispossesscd the oppressing 
few either by open rebcllion or through the silent but steadfast opera- 
tion of ideological forces5 
Many of the great historical conquests were able to endure be- 
cause the invadcrs cntered into alliancc with those classes of the de- 
feated nation which werc supported by the ruling ideology and were 
thus considered legitimate rulers. This was the system adopted by the 
Tartars in Russia, by the Turks in the Danube principalities and by 
and Iarge in Hungary and Transylvania, and by the British and the 
Dutch in the Indies. A comparatively insignificant number of Britons 
could rule many hundrcd millions of Indians because the Indian 

5. Cf. below, pp. 645646. 

The Role of Ideas 

princes and aristocratic landowners looked upon British rule as a 
means for the preservation of their privileges and supplied it with 
the support which the generally acltnoudedged ideology of India 
gave to their own supremacy. England's Indian empire was firm as 
long as public opinion approved of the traditional social order. The 
Pax Britannica safeguarded the princes' and the landlords' privileges 
and protected the masses against the agonies of wars between the 
principalities and of succession wars within them. In our day the 
infiltration of subversive ideas from abroad has undermined British 
rule and at the same time threatens the preservation of the country's 
age-old social order. 

Victorious minorities sometimes owe their success to their techno- 
logical superiority. This does not alter the case. In the long run it is 
impossible to withhold the better arms from the members of the 
majority. Not the equipment of their armed forces, but ideological 
factors safeguarded the British in India.@ 

A country's public opinion may be ideologically divided in such 
a way that no group is strong enough to establish a durabIe govern- 
menr. Then anarchy emerges. Revolutions and civil strife become 
permanent. 

T~raditionalisnz as an Ideology 


Traditionalism is an ideology which considers loyalty to valuations, 
customs, and methods of procedure handed down or allegedly handed 
down from ancestors both right and expedient. It is not an essential mark 
of traditionalism that these forefathers were the ancestors in the biological 
meaning of the term or can be fairly considered such; they were sometimes 
only the previous inhabitants of the country concerned or supporters of 
the same religious creed or only precursors in the exercise of some special 
task. Who is to be considered an ancestor and what is the content of the 
body of tradition handed down are detcrmined by the concrete teachings 
of each variety of traditionalism. The ideology brings into prominence 
some of the ancestors and relegates others to oblivion; it sometimes calls 
ancestors people who had nothing to do with the alleged posterity. It 
often constructs a "traditional" doctrine which is of recent origin and is 
at variance with the ideologies really held by the ancestors. 

Traditionalism tries to justify its tenets by citing the success they secured 
in the past. Whether this assertion conforms with the facts, is another 
question. Research could sometimes unmask errors in the historical state- 
ments of a traditional belief. However, this did not always explode the 
traditional doctrine. For the core of traditionalism is not real historical

facts, but an opinion about them, however mistaken, and a will to believe 
things to which the authority of ancient origin is attributed. 

4. Meliorism and the Idea of Progress 
The notions of progress and retrogression make sense only within 
a teleological system of thought. In such a framework it is sensible to 
call approach toward the goal aimed at progress and a movement in 
the opposite direction retrogression. Without reference to some 
agent's action and to a definite goal both these notions are empty 
and void of any meaning. 

It was one of the shortcomings of nineteenth-century philosophies 
to have misinterpreted the meaning of cosmic change and to have 
smuggled into the theory of biological transformation the idea of 
progress. Looking backward from any given state of things to the 
states of the past one can fairly use the terms development and evolu- 
tion in a neutral sense. Then evolution signifies the process which 
led from past conditions to the present. But one must guard against 
the fatal error of confusing change with improvcrnent and evolution 
with evolution toward higher forms of life. Neither is it permissible 
to substitute a pseudoscientific anthropoccntrism for the anthropocen- 
trism of rcligion and the older metaphysical doctrines. 

Howcver, there is no need for praxeology to enter into a critique 
of his philosophy. Its task is to explode the errors implied in current 
ideologies. 

Eighteenth-century social philosophy was convinced that mankind 
has now finally entered the age of reason. While in the past theological 
and metaphysical errors were dominant, henceforth reason will be 
supreme. Pcople will free themselves more and more from the chains 
of tradition and superstition and will dedicate all their efforts to the 
continuous improvement of social institutions. Every new genera- 
tion will contribute its part to this glorious task. With the progress 
of time society will more and more become the society of free men, 
aiming at the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Temporary 
setbacks are, of course, not impossible. But finally the good cause will 
triumph because it is the cause of reason. People called themselves 
happy in that they were citizens of an age of enlightenment which 
through the discovery of the laws of rational conduct paved the 
way toward a steady amelioration of human affairs. What they 
lamented was only the fact that they themselves were too old to wit- 
ness all the beneficial effects of the new philosophy. "I would wish," 
said Bentham to Philarirte Chasles, "to be granted the privilege to 


The Role of ldeas I93 

live the years which I have still to live, at the end of each of the cen- 
turies following my death; tlms I could witness the effects of my 
writings." 

All these hopes were founded on the firm conviction, proper to the 
age, that the masses are both morally good and reasonable. The upper 
strata, the privileged aristocrats living on the fat of the land, were 
thought depraved. The common people, especially the peasants and 
the workers, were glorified in a romantic mood as noble and unerring 
in their judgment. Thus the philosophers were confident that democ- 
racy, government by the pcopIe, would bring about social perfec- 
tion. 

This prejudice was the fateful error of the humanitarians, the 
philosophers, and the liberals. Men are not infallible; they err very 
often. It is not true that the masses are always right and know the 
means for attaining the cnds aimed at. "Belief in the common man" 
is no better founded than was belief in the supernatural gifts of kings, 
priests, and noblemen. Democracy guarantees a system of govern- 
ment in accordance with the wishes and plans of the majority. But 
it cannot prevent majorities from falling victim to erroneous ideas 
and from adopting inappropriate policies which not only fail to 
realize the ends aimed at but result in disaster. Majorities too may err 
and destroy our civilization. The good cause will not triumph merely 
on account of its reasonableness and expediency. Only if men are 
such that they will finally espouse policies reasonable and likcly to at- 
tain the ultimate cnds aimed at, will civilization improve and society 
and state render men more satisfied, although not happy in a meta- 
physical sense. Whether or not this condition is given, only the un- 
known future can reveal. 

There is no room within a system of praxeology for meliorism and 

optimistic fatalism. Man is frec in the sense that he must daily choose 

anew between policies that lead to success and those that lead to 

disaster, social disintegration, and barbarism. 

The term progress is nonsensical when applied to cosmic events or 

to a comprehensive world view. We have no information about the 

plans of the prime mover. But it is different with its use in the frame 

of an ideological doctrine. The immense majority strives after a 

greater and better supply of food, clothes, homes, and other material 

amenities. In calling a rise in the masses' standard of living progress 

and improvement, economists do not espouse a mean materialism. 

They simply establish the fact that people are motivated by the 

7. Philar6te Chasles, Etudes sur les ho7nmes et les moers du x~xesi2cle (Paris, 
1849)t p. 89. 

Human Action 

urge to improve the material conditions of their existence. They judge 
policies from the point of view of the aims men want to attain. He 
who disdains the fall in infant mortality and the gradual disappearance 
of famines and plagues may cast the first stone upon the materialism 
of the economists. 

There is but one yardstick for the appraisal of human action: 
whether or not it is fit to attain the ends aimed at by acting men. 


X. EXCHANGE WITHIN SOCIETY 
I. Autistic Exchange and Interpersonal Exchange 
CTION always is essentially the exchange of one state of affairs Afor another state of affairs. If the action is performed by an in- 
dividual without any reference to cooperation with other individuals, 
we may call it autistic exchange. An instance: the isolated hunter who 
kills an animal for his own consumption; he exchanges leisure and a 
cartridge for food. 

Within society cooperation substitutes interpersonal or social ex- 
change for autistic exchanges. Man gives to other men in order to 
receive from them. Mutuality emerges. Man serves in order to be 
served. 

The exchange relation is the fundamental social relation. Inter- 
personal exchange of goods and services weaves the bond which 
unites men into society. The societal formula is: do ut des. Where 
there is no intentional mutuality, where an action is performed with- 
out any design of being benefited by a concomitant action of other 
men, there is no interpersona1 exchange, but autistic exchange. It 
does not matter whether the autistic action is beneficial or detrimental 
to other people or whether it does not concern them at alI. A genius 
may perform his task for himself, not for the crowd; however, he is 
an outstanding benefactor of mankind. The robber kills the victim 
for his own advantage; the murdered man is by no means a partner in 
this crime, he is mereIy its object; what is done, is done against him. 

Hostile aggression was a practice common to man's nonhuman fore- 
bears. Camciaus adpnrpeseh! cmperatiy is the mtc=me ~f 2 
long evolutionary process. Ethnology and hlstory have provided us 
with interesting information concerning the beginning arid the primi- 
tive patterns of interpersonal exchange. Some consider the custom of 
mutual giving and returning of presents and stipulating a certain re- 
turn present in advance as a precursory pattern of intcrpersonal ex- 
change.l Others consider dumb barter as the primitive mode of trade. 
However, to make presents in the expectation of being rewarded 

r. Gustav Cassel, The Theory of Social Economy, trans. by S. L. Banon, 
(new ed. London, ~9321,p. 371. 

Human Action 

by the receiver's return present or insorder to acquire the favor of 
a man whose animosity could be disastrous, is already tantamount to 
interpersonal exchange. The same applies to dumb barter which is 
distinguished from other modes of bartering and trading only through 
the abscnce of oral discussion. 

It is the essential characteristic of the categories of human action 
that they are apodictic and absolute and do not admit of any grada- 
tion. There is action or nonaction, there is exchange or nonexchange; 
everything which applies to action and exchange as such is given 
or not given in every individual instance according to whether there 
is or there is not action and exchange. In the same way the boundaries 
between autistic exchange and interpersonal cxchange are sharply 
distinct. Making one-sided presents without the aim of being re- 
warded by any conduct on the part of the receiver or of third per- 
sons is autistic exchange. The donor acquires the satisfaction which 
the better condition of the receiver gives to him. The receiver gets 
the present as a God-sent gift. But if presents are given in order to 
influence some people's conduct, they are no longer one-sided, but 
a variety of interpersonal exchange between the donor and the man 
whose conduct they are designed to influence. Although the emer- 
gence of interpersonal exchange was the result of a long evolution, no 
gradual transition is conceivable between autistic and interpcrsonal 
exchangc. There were no intermediary modes of exchange between 
them. The step which leads from autistic to interpersonal exchange 
was no less a jump into something entirely new and essentially dif- 
ferent than was the step from automatic reaction of the cells and 
nerves to conscious and purposeful behavior, to action. 

2. Contractual Bonds and E-Tegcmonic Bonds 
There are two different kinds of social cooperation: cooperation 

by virtue of contract and coordinatim, and cooperation by virtue of 

command and subordination or hegemony. 

Wherc and as far as cooperation is based on contract, the logical 

relation betwccn the cooperating individuals is symmetrical. They 

are all parties to interpersonal exchange contracts. John has the same 

relation to Tom as Tom has to John. Where and as far as cooperation 

is based on command and subordination, there is the man who com- 

mands and there are those who obey his orders. The logical relation 

between these two classes of men is asymmetrical. There is a director 

and there are people under his care. The director alone chooses and 

directs; the others-the wards-are mere pawns in his actions. 


Exchange Within Society 197 

The power that calls into life and animates any social body is al- 
ways ideological might, and the fact that makes an individual a mem- 
ber of any socia1 compound is always his own conduct. This is no 
less valid with regard to a hegemonic societal bond. It is true, people 
are as a rule born into the most important hegemonic bonds, into 
the family and into the state, and this was also the case with the 
hegemonic bonds of older days, slavery and serfdom, which disap- 
peared in the realm of Western civilization. But no physical violence 
and compulsion can possibly force a man against his wiII to remain 
in the status of the ward of a hegemonic order. What violence or the 
threat of violcnce brings about is a state of affairs in which subjection 
as a rule is considered more desirable than rebelIion. Faced with the 
choice between the consequences of obedience and of disobedience, 
the ward prefers the former and thus integrates himself into the 
hegemonic bond. Every new command places this choice before him 
again. In yielding again and again he himself contributes his share to 
the continuous existence of the hegemonic societal body. Even as a 
ward in such a system he is an acting human being, i.e., a being not 
simply yielding to blind impulses, but using his reason in choosing be- 
tween alternatives. 

What differentiates the hegemonic bond from the contractual bond 
is the scope in which the choices of the individuals detcrmine the 
course of events. As soon as a man has decided in favor of his subjec- 
tion to a hegemonic system, he becomes, within the margin of this 
system's activities and for the time of his subjection, a pawn of the 
director's actions. Within the hegemonic societal body and as far 
as it directs its subordinates' conduct, only the director acts. The 
wards act only in choosing subordination; having once chosen sub- 
ordination they no longer act for themselves, they are taken care of. 

In the frame of a contractuaI society the individual members ex- 

change definite quantities of goods and services of a definite quality. 

In choosing subjection in a hegemonic body a man neither gives nor 

receives anything that is definite. He integrates himself into a system 

in which he has to render indefinite services and will receive what the 

director is wilIing to assign to him. He is at the mercy of the director. 

The director alone is free to choose. Whether the director is an in- 

dividual or an organized group of individuals, a directorate, and 

whether the director is a selfish maniacal tyrant or a benevolent pater- 

nal despot is of no relevance for the structure of the whole sys- 

tem. 

The distinction between these two kinds of social cooperation is 

common to all theories of society. Ferguson described it as the con- 


I 98 Human Actiolz 

trast between warlike nations and commercial nations; Saint Simon 
as the contrast between pugnacious nations and peaceful or industrial 
nations; Herbert Spencer as the contrast between societies of individ- 
ual frccdom and those of a militant structure; Sombart as the con- 
trast between heroes and peddler^.^ The Marxians distinguish be- 
tween the "gentile organization" of a fabulous state of primitive 
socicty and the eternal bliss of socialism on the one hand and the nn- 
speakable degradation of capitalism on the other hand.The hTazi 
philosophers distinguish the counterfeit system of bourgeois security 
from the heroic system of authoritarian I;iihrertum. The valuation of 
both systems is different with the various sociologists. But they fully 
agree in the establishment of the contrast and no less in recognizing 
that no third principle is thinkable and feasible. 

Western civilization as well as the civilization of the more advanced 
Eastern peoples are achievements of men who have cooperated ac- 
cording to the pattern of contractuaI coordination. These civilizations, 
it is true, have adopted in some rcspects bonds of hegemonic struc- 
ture. The state as an apparatus of compulsion and coercion is by neces- 
sity a hegemonic organization. So is the family and its household com- 
munity. Howcver, the characteristic feature of these civiIizations is 
the contractual structure proper to the cooperation of the individual 
families. There once prevailed almost complete autarky and economic 
isolation of the individual household units. When interfamilial ex- 
change of goods and services was substituted for each family's eco- 
nomic seIf-sufficiency, it was, in a11 nations commonIy considered 
civilized, a cooperation based on contract. Human civilization as it 
has been hitherto known to historical experience is preponderantly 
a product of contractual relations. 

Any kind of human cooperation and social mutuality is essentially 
an order of peace and conciliatory settlement of disputes. In the 
domestic relations of any societal unit, be it a contractual or a 
hegemonic bond, there must be peace. Where there are violent con- 
flicts and as far'as there are such conflicts, there is neither cooperation 
nor socictal bonds. Those political parties which in their eagerness to 
substitute the hegemonic system for the contractual system point 
at the rottenness of peace and of bourgeois security, extol the moral

nobility of violence and bloodshed and praise war and revolution as 
the emincntly natural methods of intcrhuman relations, contradict 
themselves. For their own utopias are designed as realms of peace. 
The Reich of the Xazis and the co~n~nonwcalth 

of the Marxians are 
planncd as societies of undisturbed pcace. They are to be created by 
pacification, i.e., the violent subjection of all those not ready to 
yield without rcsistance. In a contractual world various states can 
quietly coexist. In a hegemonic world there can only be one Reich 
or commonwcalth and only one dictator. Socialism must choose be- 
tween a renunciation of the advantages of division of labor encom- 
passing the whole earth and all peoples and the establishment of a 
world-crnbracing hegemonic order. It is this fact that made Russian 
Bolshevism, German Nazism, and Italian Fascism "dynamic," i.e., 
aggressive. Undcr contractual conditions empircs arc dissolved into 
a loose Icague of autonomous member nations. The hegemonic system 
is bound to strive after the annexation of all indepcndcnt states. 

The contractual order of society is an order of right and law. It 
is a government undcr the rule of law (Rechtsstaat) as differentiated 
from the wclfare state (Wohlfahtsstnat) or paternal state. Right or 
law is the complex of rules determining the orbit in which individuals 
are free to act. No such orbit is left to wards of a hegemonic society. 
In the hegemonic state there is ncither right nor law; there are only 
directives and regulations w-hich the director may change daily and 
apply with what discrimination he pleases and which the wards must 
obey. The wards have one freedom only: to obey without asking 
questions. 

3. Calculative Action 
All the praxeological categories are eternal and unchangeable as 
they are uniquely determined by the logical structure of the human 
mind and by the natural conditions of man's existence. Both in acting 
and in theorizing about acting, man can neither free himself from 
these categories nor go beyond them. A kind of acting categorially 
different from that determined by thesc categories is neither possible 
nor conceivable for man. Man can never comprehend something 
which would be neither action nor nonaction. There is no history of 
acting; thcrc is no evolution which wouId lead from nonaction to 
action; there arc no transitory stages between action and nonaction. 
There is only acting and nonacting. And for evcry concrete action 
all that is rigorously valid which is categorially established with re- 
gard to action in general. 


200 Human Action 

Every action can make use of ordinal numbers. For the application 
of cardinal numbers and for the arithmetical computation based on 
them special conditions are required. These conditions emerged in 
the historicaI evolution of the contractual society. Thus the way was 
opencd for computation and calculation in the planning of future 
action and in establishing the effects achieved by past action. Cardinal 
numbers and their use in arithmetical operations are also eternal and 
immutable categories of the human mind. But their applicability to 
premeditation and the rccording of action depcnds on certain condi- 
tions which were not given in the early state of human affairs, which 
appeared only later, and which could possibly disappear again. 

It was cognition of what is going on within a world in which action 
is computable and caIcrilable that led men to elaboration of the sciences 
of praxeology and economics. Economics is essentially a theory of 
that scope of action in which calculation is applied or can be applied 
if certain conditions are realized. No other distinction is of greater 
significance, both for human life and for the study of human action, 
than that between ca1culable action and noncalculable action. Modern 
civilization is above all characterized by the fact that it has elaborated 
a method which makes the use of arithmetic possible in a broad field 
of activities. This is what people have in mind when attributing to it 
the-not very expedient and often misleading-epithet of rationality. 

The mental grasp and analysis of the problems present in a cal- 
culating market system were the starting point of economic think- 
ing which finally led to general praxeological cognition. However, it 
is not the consideration of this historicaI fact that makes it necessary 
to start exposition of a comprehensive system of economics by an 
anaIysis of the market economy and to place before this analysis an 
examination of the problem of economic calculation. Not historical 
nor heuristic aspects enjoin such a procedure, but the requirements 
of logical and systematic rigor. The problems concerned are apparent 
and practical only within the sphere of the calculating market econ- 
omy. It is only a hypothetical and figurative transfer which makes 
them utilizab~d for the scrutiny of other systems of society's economic 
organization which do not allow of any calculation. Economic cal- 
culation is the fundamental issue in the comprehension of all problems 
commonly called economic.

XI. VALUATION WITHOUT CALCULATION 
I. The Gradation of the Means 
CTING man transfers the valuation of ends he aims at to the means. 

AOther things being equal, he assigns to the total amount of the 
various means the same value he attaches to the end which they are 
fit to bring about. For the moment we may disregard the time needed 
for production of the end and its influence upon the relation between 
the value of the ends and that of the means. 

The gradation of the means is like that of the ends a process of 
preferring a to b. It is preferring and settina aside. It is manifestation 

9

of a judgment that a is more intensely desired than is b. It opens a 
field for application of ordinal numbers, but it is not open to applica- 
tion of cardinal nurnbers and arithmetical operations based on them. 
If somebody gives me the choice among three tickets entitling one 
to attend the operas Ai'da, Falstafl, and Traz'iata and I take, if I can 
only take one of them, Ai'da, and if I can take one more, Falstaff also, 
I have made a choice. That means: under given conditions I prefer 
Aida and Falstafl to Trauiata; if I could only choose one of them, I 
would prefer Ai'da and renounce Falstafl. If I call the admission to 
AYda a, that to Falstaff b and that to Travinta c, I can say: I prefer a 
to b and b to c. 

The immediate goal of acting is frequently the acquisition of 
countable and measurable supplies of tangible things. Then acting 
man has to choose between countable quantities; he prefers, for ex- 
ample, 15 r to 7 p; but if he had to choose between I 5 r and 8 p, he 
might prefer 8 p. We can express this state of affairs by declaring that 
he values I j r less than 8 p, but higher than 7 p. This is tantamount 
to the statement that he prefers a to b and b to c. The substitution of 
8 p for a, of 15 r for b and of 7 p for c changes neither the meaning of 
the statement nor the fact that it describes. It certainly does not render 
reckoning with cardinal numbers possible. It. does not open a field 
for economic calculation and the mental operations based upon such 
calculation. 


Human Action 

2. The Barter-Fiction of the Elementary Theory 
of Value and Priccs 
The elaboration of economic theory is heuristically dependent on 
the logical processes of reckoning to such an extent that the econo- 
mists failed to realize the fundamental problem involved in the 
methods of economic calculation. They wcre prone to take economic 
calculation as a matter of course; they did not see that it is not an 
ultimate given, but a derivative requiring reduction to more elemen- 
tary phenomena. They misconstrued economic calculation. They took 
it for a category of all human action and ignored the fact that it is only 
a category inherent in acting under special conditions. They were 
fuIly aware of the fact that interpersonal exchange, and consequently 
market exchange effected hy the intermediary of a common medium 
of exchange-money, and therefore prices, are special features of a 
certain state of society's economic organization which did not exist in 
primitive civilizations and could possibly disappear in the further 
course of historical change.= But they did not comprehend that 
money prices are the only vehicle of economic calculation. Thus most 
of their studics are of little use. Even the writings of the most eminent 
economists are vitiated to some extent by the fallacies implied in 
their ideas about economic calculation. 

'rhe modcrn theory of value and prices shows how the choices of 
individuals, their preferring of some things and setting aside of other 
things, result, in the sphcre of interpersonal exchange, in the emer- 
gence of market price^.^ These masterful expositions are unsatisfac- 
tory in some minor points and disfigured by unsuitable expressions. 
But they are essentially irrefutable. As far as they need to be amended, 
it must he done by a consistent elaboration of the fundamental 
thoughts of thcir authors rather than by a refutation of their reason- 

iilg. 

In order to trace back the phenomena of the marlret to the uni- 
versal category of preferring n to b, the elementary theory of value 
and prices is bound to use some imaginary constructions. The use of 
imaginary constructions to which nothing corresponds in reality is 
an indispensable tool of thinking. No other method would have con- 
tributed anything to the interpretation of reality. But one of the most 

I. The Gcrman Historical School expressed this by asserting that private 
ownership of the means of production, market exchange, and money are "his- 
torical caterories."

important problems of science is to avoid the fallacies which ill-consid- 
ered employment of such constructions can entail. 

The elementary theory of value and prices employs, apart from 
other imaginary constructions to be dealt with later,3 the construction 
of a market in which all transactions are performed in direct exchange. 
There is no money; goods and services are directly bartered against 
other goods and services. This imaginary construction is necessary. 
One must disregard the intermediary role played by money in order 
to realize that what is ultimately exchanged is always economic goods 
of the first order against other such goods. Money is nothing but a 
medium of interpersonal exchange. But one must carefully guard one- 
self against the delusions which this construction of a market with 
direct exchange can easily engender. 

A serious blunder that owes its origin and its tenacity to a misin-
terpretation of this imaginary construction was the assumption that 
the medium of exchange is a neutral factor only. According to this 
opinion the only difference between direct and indirect exchange 
was that only in the latter was a medium of exchange used. The in- 
terpolation of money into the transaction, it was asserted, did not 
affect the main features of the business. One did not ignore the fact 
that in the course of history tremendous alterations in the purchasing 
power of money have occurred and that these fluctuations often con- 
vulsed the whole system of exchange. But it was believed that such 
events were exceptional facts caused by inappropriate policies. Only 
"bad" money can bring about such disarrangements. In addition 
people misunderstood the causes and effects of these disturbances. 
They tacitly assumed that changes in purchasing power occur with 
regard to all goods and services at the same time and to the same 
extent. This is, of course, what the fable of money's neutrality im- 
plies. The whole theory of catallactics, it was held, can be elaborated 
under the assumption that there is direct exchange only. If this is 
once achieved, the only thing to be added is the "simple" insertion 
of money ternx into the complex of theorems concerning direct ex- 
change. However, this final completion of the catallactic system was 
considered of minor importance only. It was not believed that it 
could alter anything essential in the structure of economic teachings. 
The main task of economics was study of direct exchange. What re- 
mained to be done besides this was at best only a scrutiny of the prob- 
lems of "bad" money. 

Complying with this opinion economists neglected to lay due 
stress upon the problems of indirect exchange. Their treatment of 
monetary problems was superficial; it was only loosely connectcd with 

3. See below, pp. 237-257. 

Human Action 
the main body of their scrutiny of the market process. About the turn 
of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the problems of indirect 
exchange were by and large relegated to a subordinate place. There 
were treatises oh catallactics which dealt only incidentally and 
cursorily with monetary matters, and there were books on currency 
and banking which did not even attempt to integrate their subject 
into thc structure of a catallactic system. At the universities of the 
Anglo-Saxon countries there were separate chairs for economics and 
for currency and banking, and at most of the German universities 
monetary problcms were almost entirely di~regarded.~ Only later 
economists realized that some of the most important and most intri- 
cate problems of catallactics are to be found in the field of indirect 
exchange and that an economic theory which does not pay fuIl re- 
gard to them is lamentably defective. The coming into vogue of in- 
vestigations concerning the relation between the "natural rate of 
interest" and the "money rate of interest," the ascendancy of the 
monetary theory of the trade cycle, and the entire demolition of the 
doctrine of the simultaneousness and evenness of the changes in the 
purchasing power of money were marks of the new tenor of eco- 
nomic thought. Of course, these new ideas were essentially a continua- 
tion of the work gloriously begun by David Humc, the British Cur- 
rency School, John Stuart Mill and ~airnes. 
still more detrimental was a second error which emerged from the 
careless use of the imaginary construction of a market with direct 
exchange. 
An inveterate fallacy asserted that things and services exchanged 
are of equal value. Value was considered as objective, as an intrinsic 
quality inherent in things and not mcreIy as the expression of various 
pcoplc's eagerness to acquire them. People, it was assumed, first estab- 
lished the magnitude of value proper to goods and serviccs by an 
act of measurement and then procecdcd to barter them against quanti- 
ties of goods and services of the same amount of value. This fallacy 
frustrated Aristotle's approach to economic problems and, for al- 
most two thousand years, the reasoning of all those for whom Aris- 

4. Neglect of the problems of indirect exchange was certainly influenced by 
political prepossessions. People did not want to give up the thesis according to 
which economic depressions are an evil inherent in the capitalist mode of pro- 
duction and are in no way caused by attempts to lower the rate of interest by 
credit expansion. Fashionable teachers of economics deemed it "unscientific" to 
explain depressions as a phenomenon originating "only" out of events in the 
sphere of money and credit. There were even surveys of the history of business 
cycle theory which omitted any discussion of the monetary thesis. Cf., eg., Ernst 
von Hcrgmann, Geschichte der nationalokonomischen Krisentheorien (Stuttgart, 
I 895). 


Vdzmion Without Calculat2"on 

totle's opinions were authoritative. It seriously vitiated the marvelous 
achievements of the classical economists and rendered the writings of 
their epigones, especially those of Marx and the Marxian school, en- 
tirely futile. The basis of modern cconomics is the cognition that it is 
precisely the disparity in the value attached to the objects exchanged 
that results in their being exchanged. People buy and sell only be- 
cause they appraise the things given up less than those received. Thus 
the notion of a measurement of value is vain. An act of exchange is 
neither preceded nor accompanied by any process which could be 
called a measuring of value. An individual may attach the same value 
to two things; but then no exchange can result. But if there is a 
diversity in valuation, all that can be asserted with regard to it is 
that one a is valued higher, that it is preferred to one 6. Values and 
valuations are intensive quantities and not extensive quantities. They 
are not susceptible to mental grasp by the application of cardinal 

numbers. 

However, the spurious idea that values are measurable and arc really 
measured in the conduct of economic transactions was so deeply 
rooted that even eminent economists fell victim to the fallacy im- 
plied. Even Friedrich von Wieser and Irving Fisher took it for granted 
that there must be something like measurement of value and that eco- 
nomics must be able to indicate and to explain the method by which 
such measurement is effected.Wost of the lesser economists simply 
maintained that money serves "as a measure of valucs." 

Now, we must realize that valuing means to prefer a to b. There is 
-logically, epistemologically, psychologically, and praxeologically 
--only one pattern of preferring. It does not matter whether a lover 
prefers one girl to other girls, a man one fricnd to other people, an 
amateur one painting to other paintings, or a consumer a loaf of 
bread to a piece of candy. Preferring always means to love or to de- 
sire a more than b. Just as there is no standard and no measurement of 
sexual love, of friendship and sympathy, and of aesthetic enjoyment, 
so there is no measurement of the value of commodities. If a man 
exchanges two pounds of butter for a shirt, all that we can assert 
with regard to this transaction is that he-at the instant of the trans- 
action and under the conditions which this instant offers to him-pre- 
fers one shirt to two pounds of butter. It is certain that every act of 
preferring is characterized by a definite psychic intensity of the 
feelings it implies. There are grades in the intensity of the desire to

Theory of Money and Credit, trans. by H. E. Batson (London, 1934), ?p42-44;

(Geneva, ~gqo),pp. 192-194. 

2 06 Human Action 

attain a definite goal and this intensity determines the psychic profit 
which the successful action brings to the acting individual. But 
psychic quantities can only be felt. They are entirely personal, and 
there is no semantic means to express their intensity and to convey 
information about them to other people. 

Thcre is no method available to construct a unit of value. Let us 
remember that. two units of a homogeneous supply are necessarily 
valued differently. The value attached to the nth ~mit is Iower than 
that attached to the (n -x)th unit. 

In the market society there are money prices. Economic calcula- 
tion is calculation in terms of money prices. The various quantities 
of goods and services enter into this calculation with the amount 
of moncy for which thcy are bought and sold on the market or for 
which thcy could prospectively be bought and sold. It is a fictitious 
assumption that an isolated self-sufficient individual or the general 
manager of a socialist system, i.e., a system in which there is no mar- 
lrct for means of production, could calculate. There is no way which 
could lead one from the money computation of a market economy 
to any kind of computation in a nonmarltet systcm. 

The Theory of Value and Socialism 

Socialists, Institutionalists and the Historical School have blamed 
cconornists for having employed the imaginary construction of an isolated 
individual's thinking and acting. This Robinson Crusoe pattern, it is as- 
serted, is of no use for the study of the conditions of a market economy. 
The rebuke is somewhat justified. Imaginary constructions of an isolated 
individuaI and of a planned economy without market exchange become 
utilizable only through the implication of the fictitious assumption, self- 
contradictory in thought and contrary to reality, that economic calcula- 
tion is possible also within a system without a market for the means of 
production. 

It was certainly a serious blunder that economists did not become aware 
of this difference between the conditions of a market economy and a non- 
markct economy. Yet the socialists had little reason for criticizing this fault. 
For it consisted precisely in thc fact that the economists tacitly implied the 
assumption that a socialist order of society could also resort to economic 
calculation and that thcy thus asserted the possibility of the realization of 
the socialist plans. 

The classical economists and their epigones could not, of course, recog- 
nize the problems involved. If it were true that the value of things is 
determined by the quantity of labor required for their production or re- 
production, then there is no further problem of economic calculation. The 
supporters of the labor theory of value cannot be blamed for having mis- 
construed the problems of a socialist system. Their fateful failure was their 


Valuation Without Calculation 

untenable doctrine of value. That some of them were ready to consider 
the imaginary construction of a socialist economy as a useful and realizable 
pattern for a thorough reform of social organization did not contradict the 
essential content of their theoretical analysis. But it was different with sub- 
jective catallactics. It was unpardonable for the modern economists to have 
failed to recognize the problems involved. 

Wieser was right when he once declared that many economists have 
unwittingly dealt with the value theory of communism and have on that 
account neglected to elaborate that of the present state of society.= It is 
tragic that he himself did not avoid this failure. 

The illusion that a rational order of economic management is possible 
in a society based on public ownership of the means of production owed 
its origin to the value theory of the classical economists and its tenacity 
to the failure of many modern economists to think through consistently 
to its ultimate conclusions thc fundamental theorem of the subjectivist 
theory. Thus the socialist utopias were generated and preserved by the 
shortcomings of those scliools of thought which the Marxians reject as 
"an ideological disguise of the selfish class interest of the exploiting 
bourgeoisie." In truth it was the errors of these schools that made the 
socialist ideas thrive. This fact clearly demonstrates the emptiness of the 
Marxian teachings concerning "ideologies" and its modern offshoot, the 
sociology of knowledge. 

3. The Problem of Economic Calculation 
Acting man uscs linowledge provided by the natural sciences for 
the elaboration of technology, the applied sciencc of action possible 
in the field of external events. Technology shows what could be 
achieved if onc wanted to achieve it, and how it could be achieved 
providcd people were prcparcd to employ the means indicated. With 
the progress of the natural sciences technology progressed too; many 
would prefer to sav that the desire to improve tcchnological methods 
prompted the pr&ress of the natural sciences. The quantification 
of the natural sciences made technology quantitative. Modern technol- 
ogy is esscntiaIly the applied art of quantitative prediction of the 
oukomc of possible action. One calculates with a reasonable degree 
of precision the outcome of planned actions, and one calculates in 
order to arrange an action in such a way that a definite result emerges. 

However, thc mere information conveyed by technology would 
suffice for the performance of calculation only if all means of produc- 
tion-both rnatcrial and human-couId be perfectly substituted for 
one anothcr according to definite ratios, or if they all were absolutely 
specific. In the former case all means of production would be fit, 

6. Cf.Friedrich von Wieser, Der natiirliche Wert (Vienna, 188~),p. 60, n. 3. 

208 Human Action 

although according to different ratios, for the attainment of all ends 
whatever; things would be as if only one kind of means-one kind 
of economic goods of a higher order existed. In the latter case each 
means could be employed for the attainment of one end only; one 
would attach to each group of complementary factors of production 
the value attached to the respective good of the first order. (Here 
again we disregard provisionally the modifications brought about by 
the time factor.) Neither of these two conditions is present in the 
universe in which man acts. The means can only be substituted for one 
another within narrow limits; they are more or less specific means 
for the attainment of various ends. But, on the other hand, most 
means are not absolutely specific; most of them are fit for various 
purposes. The facts that there are different classes of means, that 
most of the means are better suited for the realization of some ends, 
less suited for the attainment of some other ends and absolutely use- 
less for the production of a third group of ends, and that therefore the 
various means allow for various uses, set man the tasks of aIlocating 
them to those employments in which they can render the best serv- 
ice. Ilere computation in kind as applied by technology is of no 
avail. Technology operates with countable and measurable quantities 
of external things and effects; it knows causal relations between them, 
but it is foreign to their relevance to human wants and desires. Its 
field is that of objective use-value only. It judges all problems from 
the disinterested point of view of a neutral observer of physical, 
chcmical, and biologicaI events. For the notion of subjective use- 
value, for the specifically human angle, and for the dilemmas of 
acting man there is no room in the teachings of technology. It ignores 
the economic problem: to employ the available means in such a way 
that no want more urgently felt should remain unsatisfied because 
the means suitable for its attainment were employed-wasted-for 
the attainmcnt of a want less urgently felt. For the solution of such 
problems technology and its methods of counting and measuring are 
unfir. Technology reiis how a given end could be attairied by the 
employment of various means which can be used together in various 
combinations, or how various available means could be employed for 
certain purposes. But it is at a loss to tell man which procedures he 
should choose out of the infinite variety of imaginable and possible 
modes of production. What acting man wants to know is how he 
must employ the available means for the best possible-the most 
economic-removal of felt uneasiness. But technology provides him 
with nothing more than statements about causal relations between 
external things. It tells, for example, 7 a +3 b +5 c + . . . x n are 


Valuation Without Calculation 

liable to bring about 8 P. But although it knows the value attached by 
acting man to the various goods of the first order, it cannot decide 
whether this precept or any other out of the infinite multitude of 
similarly constructed precepts best serves the attainment of the ends 
sought by acting man. The art of engineering can establish how a 
bridge must be built in order to span a river at a given point and to 
carry definite loads. But it cannot answer the question whether or 
not the construction of such a bridge uzould withdraw material 
factors of production and labor from an employn~ent in which they 
could satisfy needs more urgently felt. It cannot tell whether or not 
the bridge should be built at all, where it should be built, what 
capacity for bearing burdens it should have, and which of the many 
possibilities for its construction should be chosen. TechnoIogical 
computation can establish relations between various classes of means 
only to the extent that they can be substituted for one another in the 
attempts to attain a definite goal. But action is bound to discover 
relations among all means, however dissimilar they may be, without 
any regard to the question whether or not they can replace one an- 
other in performing the same services. 

Technology and the considerations derived from it would be of 
little use for acting man if it were impossible to introduce into their 
schemes the money prices of goods and services. The projects and 
designs of engineers would be purely academic if they could not 
compare input and output on a common basis. The lofty theorist in 
the seclusion of his laboratory does not bother about such trifling 
things; what he is searching for is causal relations between various 
elements of the universe. But the practical man, eager to improve 
human conditions by removing uneasiness as far as possible, must 
know whether, under given conditions, what he is planning is the 
best method, or even a method, to make people less uneasy. He must 
know whether what he wants to achieve will be an improvement 
when compared with the present state of affairs and with the advan- 
tages to be expected from the execution of other technically realizable 
projects which cannot be put into execution if the project he has in 
mind absorbs the available means. Such comparisons can only be made 
by the use of money prices. 

Thus money becomes the vehicle of economic calculation. This is 
not a separate function of money. Money is the universally used 
medium of exchange, nothing else. Only because money is the com- 
mon medium of exchange, because most goods and services can be 
sold and bought on the market against tnonev, and onlv as far as tlxis 
is the case, can men use money prices in reckoning. The exchange 


t 10 Human Action 

ratios between money and the various goods and services as estab- 
lished on the market of thc past and as expected to be established on 
the market of the future are the mental tools of economic planning. 
Where there are no money prices, there arc no such things as eco- 
noniic quantities. There are only various quantitative relaths be- 
tween various causes and effects in the external world. There is no 
means for man to find out what kind of action would best serve his 
endeavors to remove uneasiness as far as possible. 

There is no need to dwell upon the primitive conditions of the 
household economy of self-sufficient farmers. These people per- 
formed only very simple processes of production. For them no 
calculation was needed, as they could directly compare input and 
output. If they wanted shirts, they grew hemp, they spun, wove, 
and sewed. They could, without any calculation, easily make up 
their minds whether or riot the toil and trouble expended were 
compensated by the product. But for civilized mankind a return to 
such a life is out of the question. 

4. Economic Calculation and the Market 
The quantitative treatment of economic problems must not be con- 
fused with the quantitative methods applied in dealing with the prob- 
lems of the external universe of physical and chemical events. The 
distinctive mark of economic calculation is that it is neither based 
upon nor related to anything which could be characterized as measure- 
ment. 

A process of measurement consists in the establishment of the 
numerical relation of an object with regard to another object, viz., 
the unit of the measurement. The ultimate source of mcasuremcnt is 
that of spatial dirncnsions. With the aid of the unit defined in refer- 
ence to extension one measures energy and potentiality, the power 
of a thing to bring about changes in other things and relations, and 
the passing of time. A pointer-reading is directly indicative of a spatial 
relation and only indirectly of other quantities. The assumption 
underlying mcasurement is the immutability of the unit. The unit 
of length is the rock upon which a11 measurement is based. It is 
assumed that man cannot help considering it immutable. 

Thc last decades have witnessed a revolution in the traditional 

epistemological setting of physics, chemistry, and mathematics. We 

are on the eve of innovations whose scope cannot be foreseen. It may 

be that the coming generations of physicists will have to face prob- 

lems in some way similar to those with which praxeology must deal. 


Valuation Without Calculation 

Perhaps they will be forced to drop the idea that there is something 
unaffectedby cosmic changes which the observer can use as a stand-
ard of measurement. But however that may come, the logical struc- 
ture of the measurement of earthly entities in the macroscopic or 
molar field of physics will not alter. Measurement in the orbit of 
microscopic physics too is made with meter scales, micrometers, 
spectrographs-ultimately with the gross sense organs of man, the 
observer and experimenter, who himself is ~nolar.~ 

It cannot free it- 
self from Euclidian geometry and from the notion of an unchange- 
able standard. 

There are monetary units and there are measurable physical units 
of various economic goods and of many-but not of all-services 
bought and sold. But the exchange ratios which we have to deal with 
are permanently fluctuating. There is nothing constant and invariable 
in them. They defy any attempt to measure them. They are not facts 
in the sense in which a physicist calls the estabIishment of the weight 
of a quantity of copper a fact. They are historical events, expressive 
of what happened once at a definiie instant and under definite cir- 
cumstances. The same numerical exchange ratio may appear again, 
but it is by no means certain whether this will really happen and, if it 
happens, the question is open whether this identical result was the 
outcome of preservation of the same circumstances or of a return to 
them rather than the outcome of the interplay of a very different 
constellation of price-determining factors. hTumbers applied by act- 
ing man in economic calculation do not refer to quantities measured 
but to exchange ratios as they are expected-on the basis of under- 
standing-to be realized on the markets of the future to which alone 
all acting is directed and which alone counts for acting man. 

We are not dealing at this point of our investigation with the prob- 
lem of a "quantitative science of economics," but with the analysis of 
the mental processes performed by acting man in applying quantita- 
tive distinctions when planning conduct. As action is always directed 
toward influencing a future state of affairs, economic calculation al- 
ways deals with the future. As far as it takes past events and exchange 
ratios of the past into consideration, it does so only for the sake of an 
arrangement of future action. 

The task which acting man wants to achieve by economic calcula- 
tion is to establish the outcome of acting by contrasting input and 
output. Economic calculation is either an estimate of the expected 
outcome of future action or the establishment of the outcome of past 
action. But the latter does not serve merely historical and didactic 

7. Cf. A. Eddington, The Philosophy of Physical Science, pp. 7-79, 168-169. 

Human Action 

aims. Its practical meaning is to show how much one is free to con-
sume without impairing the future capacity to produce. It is with 
regard to this problem that the fundamental notions of economic 
calculation-capital and income, profit and loss, spending and saving, 
cost and yield-arc developed. The practical employment of these 
notions and of all notions derived from them is inseparably linked 
with the operation of a market in which goods and services of all or-
ders are exchanged against a ~~niversalIy

used medium of exchange, 
viz., money. They would be merely academic, without any relevance 
for acting within'a worId with a different structure of action. 


XII. THE SPHERE OF ECONOMIC CALCULATION 
I. The Character of hlonctary Entries 
E 
E
COKOMIC calculation can comprehend everything that is exchanged 
against money. 

The prices of goods and services are either historical data describ- 
ing past events or anticipations of probable future events. Informa- 
tion about a past price conveys the knowledge that one or several acts 
of interpersonal exchange were effected according to this ratio. It 
does not convey directly any knowledge about future prices. We 
may often assume that the market conditions which determined the 
formation of prices in the recent past will not change at all or at 
least not change considerably in the immediate future so that prices 
too w-ill remain unchanged or change only slightly. Such expectations 
are reasonable if the prices concerned were the result of the interaction 
of many people ready to buy or to sell provided the exchange ratios 
seemed propitious to them and if the market situation was not in- 
fluenced by conditions which are considered as accidental, extraor- 
dinary, and not likely to return. However, the main task of economic 
calculation is not to deal with the problems of unchanging or only 
slightly changing market situations and prices, but to deal with 
change. The acting individual either anticipates changes which will 
occur without his own interference and wants to adjust his actions 
to this anticipated state of affairs; or hc wants to embark upon a proj- 
ect which will change conditions even if no other factors produce 
a change. The prices of the past are for him merely starting points in 
his endeavors to anticipate future prices. 

Historians and statisticians content themselves with prices of the 
past. Practical man looks at the prices of the future, be it only the 
immediate future of the next hour, day, or month. For him the prices 
of the past are merely a help in anticipating future prices. hTot only 
in his preliminary calculation of the expected outcome of planned 
action, but no less in his attempts to establish the result of his past 
transactions, he is primarily concerned with future prices. 

In balance sheets and in profit-and-loss statements the result of 
past action becomes visible as the difference between the money equiv- 


2'4 Human Action 

alent of funds owned (totaI assets minus totaI liabilities) at the 
beginning and at the end of the period reported, and as the difference 
between the money equivalent of costs incurred and gross proceeds 
earned. In such statements it is necessary to enter the estimated money 
equivalent of all assets and liabilities other than cash. These items 
should be appraised according to the prices at which they could prob- 
ably be sold in the future or, as is especially the case with equipment 
for production processes, in reference to the prices to be expected in 
the sale of merchandise manufactured with their aid. However, old 
business customs and the provisions of commercial law and of the 
tax laws have brought about a deviation from sound principles of 
accounting which aim merely at the best attainable degree of cor-
rectness. These customs and laws are not so much concerned with 
correctness in balance sheets and profit-and-loss statements as with 
the pursuit of other aims. Comnlercial legislation aims at a method 
of accounting which couId indirectly protect creditors against loss. 
It tends more or less to an appraisal of assets below their estimated 
market value in order to make the net profit and the total funds owned 
appear smaller than they really arc. Thus a safety margin is created 
which reduces the danger that, to the prejudice of creditors, too 
much might be withdrawn from the firm as alleged profit and that an 
already insolvent firm might go on untiI it had exhausted the means 
available for the satisfaction of its creditors. Contrariwise tax laws 
often tend toward a method of computation which makes earnings 
appear higher than an unbiased method would. The idea is to raise 
effective tax rates without ~naking this raise visible in the nominal 
tax rate schedules. We must therefore distinguish between economic 
calculation as it is practiced by businessmen planning future trans- 
actions and those computations of business facts which serve other 
purposes. The determination of taxes due and economic calculation 
are two different things. If a law imposing a tax upon the keeping of 
domestic servants prescribes that one male servant should be counted 
as two female servants, nobody would interpret such a provision as 
anything other than a method for determining the amount of tax 
die. Likewise if an inheritance tax law prescribes that securities 
should be appraised at the stock market quotation on the day of the 
decgdent's death, we are merely provided with a way of determining 
the amount of the tax. 

The duly kept accounts in a system of correct bookkeeping are 
accurate as to dollars and cents. They display an impressive precision, 
and the numerical exactitude of their items seems to remove ail doubts. 
In fact, the most important figures they contain arc speculative antic- 


The Sphere of Economic Calculation 

ipations of future market constellations. It is a mistake to compare 
the items of any commercial account to the items used in purely 
technological reckoning, e.g., in the design for the construction of a 
machine. The engineer-as far as he attends to the technological side 
of his job--applies only numerical relations established by the meth- 
ods of the experimental natural sciences; the businessman cannot 
avoid numerical terms which are the outcome of his understanding of 
future human conduct. The main thing in balance sheets and in profit- 
and-loss statements is the evaluation of assets and Iiabilities not em- 
bodied in cash. All such balances and statements are virtually interim 
balances and interim statements. They describe as well as possible the 
state of affairs at an arbitrarily chosen instant while life and action 
go on and do not stop. It is possible to wind up individual business 
units, but the whole system of social production never ceases. Nor 
are the assets and liabilities consisting in cash exempt from the in- 
determinacy inherent in all business accounting items. They depend 
on the future constellation of the market no less than any item of in- 
ventory or equipment. The numerical exactitude of business accounts 
and calculations must not prevent us from realizing the uncertainty 
and speculative character of their items and of all computations based 
on them. 

Yet, these facts do not detract from the efficiency of economic cal- 
culation. Economic calculation is as efficient as it can be. No reform 
could add to its efficiency. It renders to acting man all the services 
which he can obtain from numerical computation. It is, of course, not 
a means of knowing future conditions with certainty, and it does nor 
deprive action of its speculative character. But this can be considered 
a deficiency only by those who do not come to recognize the facts 
that life is not rigid, that all things are perpetually fluctuating, and 
that men have no certain knowledge about the future. 

It is not the task of economic calculation to expand man's informa- 
tion about future conditions. Its task is to adjust his actions as well 
as possible to his present opinion concerning want-satisfaction in the 
future. For this purpose acting man needs a method of computation, 
and computation requires a common denominator to which all items 
entered are to be referable. The common denominator of economic 
calculation is money. 

2. The Limits of Economic Calculation 
Economic calculation cannot comprehend things which are not 
sold and bought against money. 


2 16 Human Action 

There are things which are not for sale and for whose acquisition 
sacrifices other than money and money's worth must be expended. 
He who wants to train himself for great achievements must employ 
many means, some of which may require expenditure of money. 
But the essential things to be devoted to such an endeavor are not 
purchasable. Honor, virtue, glory, and likewise vigor, health, and 
life itself play a role in action both as means and as ends; but they do 
not enter into economic calculation. 

There are things which cannot at all be evaluated in money, and 
there arc other things which can be appraised in money only with 
regard to a fraction of the value assigned to them. The appraisal of an 
old building must disregard its artistic and historical eminence as far 
as these qualities are not a source of proceeds in money or goods 
vendible. What touches a man's heart only and does not induce other 
people to make sacrifices for its attainment remains outside the pale 
of economic caIculation. 

IHowever, all this does not in the least impair the usefulness of 
econonlic calculation. Those things which do not enter into the items 
of accountancy and calculation are either ends or goods of the first 
order. No calculation is required to acknowledge them fully and 
to make due allowance for them. All that acting man needs in order 
to make his choice is to contrast them with the total amount of costs 
their acquisition or preservation requires. Let us assume that a town 
council has to decide between two water supply projects. One of 
them implies the demolition of a historical landmark, while the other 
at the cost of an increase in money expenditure spares this land- 
mark. The fact that the feelings which recommend the conserva- 
tion of the monument cannot be estimated in a sum of money does 
not in any way impede the councilmen's decision. The values that 
are not reflected in any monetary exchange ratio are, on the contrary, 
by this very fact Iifted into a particular position which makes the 
decision rather easier. No complaint is less justified than the larnenta- 
tion that the computation methods of the market do not comprehend 
things not vendible. Moral and aesthetic values do not suffer any 
damage on account of this fact. 

Money, money prices, market transactions, and economic calcula- 

tion based upon them are the main targets of criticism. Loquacious 

sermonizers disparage Western civilization as a mean system of mon- 

gering and peddling. CompIacency, self-righteousness, and hypocrisy 

exult in scorning the "dollar-philosophy" of our age. Neurotic re- 

formers, mentally unbalanced literati, and ambitious demagogues 

take pleasure in indicting "rationality" and in preaching the gospel 


The Sphere of Economic Calculation 

of the "irrational." In the eyes of these babblers money and calcula- 
tion are the source of the most serious evils. However, the fact that 
men have developed a method of ascertaining as far as possible the 
expediency of their actions and of removing uneasiness in the most 
practical and cconomic way does not prevcnt anybody from arrang- 
ing his conduct according to the principle he considers to be right. 
The "materialism" of the stock cxchange and of business accountancy 
does not hinder anybody from living up to the standards of Thomas 
A Kempis or from dying for a noble cause. Thc fact that the masses 
prefer detective stories to poetry and that it therefore pays better 
to write the formcr than the lattcr, is not caused by the use of money 
arid monetary accounting. It is not the fault of money that there are 
gangsters, tliieves, murderers, prostitutes, corruptible officials and 
judges. It is not true that honesty does not "pay." It pays for those 
who prefer fidelity to what they consider to be right to the advan- 
tages which they could derive from a differcnt attitude. 

Other critics of economic calcuIation fail to realize that it is a 

net hod available only to people acting in the economic system of the 
division of labor in a social order based upon private ownership of 
the means of production. It can only serve thc considerations of in- 
dividuals or groups of individuals operating in the institutional setting 
of this social order. It is consequently a calculation of private profits 
and not of "social welfare." This means that the prices of the market 
are the ultimate fact for economic calculation. It cannot be applied 
for considerations whose standard is not the demand of the consumers 
as manifested on the market but the hypotheticaI valuations of a 
dictatorial body managing all national or earthly affairs. He who 
seeks to judge actions from the point of view of a pretended "social 
value," i.e., from the point of view of the "whole society," and to 
criticize them by comparison with the events in an imaginary socialist 
system in which his own will is supreme, has no use for economic cal- 
culation. Economic calculation in terms of moncy prices is the calcu- 
!ation of eiitieprericurs produziiig for the zoiisiimcrs of a market 
society. It is of no avail for other tasks. 

He who wants to employ economic calculation must not look at 
affairs in the manner of a despotic mind. Prices can be used for calcu- 
lation by the entrepreneurs, capitalists, landowners, and wage earners 
of a capitalist society. For rnattcrs beyond the pursuits of these cate- 
gories it is inadequate. It is nonsensical to evaluate in money objects 
which are not negotiated on the market and to empIoy in calculations 
arbitrary itcms which do not refer to reality. The law determines 
the amount which ought to be paid as indemnification for having 


Human Action 

caused a man's death. But the prescription enacted for the determina- 
tion of thc amends due does not mcan that there is a price for human 
life. Where there is slavcry, there are marlrct prices of slaves. Where 
there is no slavery man, human life, and health are rcs extra com-
mercium. In a society of free men the preservation of life and health 
are ends, not means. They do not enter into any process of accounting 
means. 

It is possible to determine in terms of money prices the sum of the 
income or thc wcalth of a number of people. But it is nonsensical to 
reckon national income or national wealth. As soon as we embark 
upon considerations foreign to the reasoning of a man operating within 
the palc of a market society, we are no longer helped by monetary 
calculation methods. The attcrnpts to dctermine in money the wealth 
of a nation or of the whole of mankind are as childish as the mystic 
efforts to solve the riddles of the universe by worrying about the 
dimensions of the pyramid of Cheops. If a business calculation values 
a supply of potatoes at $roo, the idea is that it will be possible to sell 
it or to replace it against this sum. If a whole entrepreneurial unit is 
estimated $r,ooo,ooo, it means that one expects to sell it for this 
amount. But what is the meaning of the items in a statement of a 
nation's total wealth? What is the meaning of the computation's 
final result? What must be entered into it and what is to be left out- 
side? Is it correct or not to encIose the "value" of the country's climate 
and thc pcople's innate abilities and acquired skill? The businessman 
can convert his property into money, but a nation cannot. 

The money equivalcnts as used in acting and in economic calcula- 
tion are money prices, i.e., exchange ratios between money and other 
goods and services. The prices are not measured in money; they 
consist in money. Prices are cither prices of the past or expected prices 
of the future. A price is necessarily a historical fact either of the past 
or of the future. There is nothing in prices which permits one to 
liken them to the measurement of physical and chemical phenom- 
ena. 

3. The Changeability of Prices 
Exchange ratios are subject to perpetual change because the condi- 
tions which produce them are perpetually changing. The value that 
an individual attaches both to money and to various goods and serv- 
ices is the outcome of a moment's choice. Every later instant may 
generate something new and bring about other considerations and 
valuations. Not that prices are fluctuating, but that they do not alter 


The Sphere of Economic Calculation 

219 

more quickly could fairly be deemed a problem requiring explana- 
tion. 

DaiIy experience teaches people that the exchange ratios of the 
market are mutable. One would assume that their ideas about prices 
would take full account of this fact. Nevertheless all popular notions 
of production and consumption, marketing and prices are more or 
less contaminated by a vague and contradictory notion of price 
rigidity. The layman is prone to consider the preservation of yester- 
day's price structure both as normal and as fair, and to condemn 
changes in the exchange ratios as a violation of the rules of nature and 
of justice. 

It would be a mistake to explain these popular beliefs as a precipi-
tate of old opinions conceived in earlier ages of more stable condi- 
tions of production and marketing, It is questionable whether or not 
prices were less changeable in those older days. On the contrary, 
it could rather be asserted that the merger of local markets into 
Iarger national markets, the finaI emergence of a world embracing 
world market, and the evolution of commerce aiming at continuously 
supplying the consumers have made price changes less frcquent and 
less sharp. In precapitalistic times there was more stability in techno- 
logical methods of production, but there was much more irregularity 
in supplying the various local ~narkcts and in adjusting supply to 
their changing demands. But even if it were true that prices were 
somewhat more stable in a remote past, it would he of little avail for 
our age. The popular notions about money and money prices are 
not derived from ideas formed in the past. It would be wrong to 
interpret them as atavistic remnants. Under modern conditions every 
individual is daily faced with so many problems of buying and sell- 
ing that we are right in assuming that his thinking abou; these matters 
is not simply a thoughtless reception of traditional ideas. 

It is easy to understand why those whose short-run interests are 

hurt by a change in prices resent such changes, emphasize, that the 

previous prices were not only fairer but also more normal, and main- 

tain that price stability is in conformity with the laws of nature and 

of morality. But every change in prices furthers the short-run inter- 

ests of other people. Those favored will certainly not be prompted 

by the urge to stress the fairness and normalcy of price rigiditv. 

ATeither atavistic reminiscences nor the state of selfish group inter- 

ests can explain the popularity of the idea of price stability. Its roots 

are to be seen in the fact that notions concerning social relations have 

been constructed according to the pattern of the natural sciences. 

The economists and sociologists who aimed at shaping the social 


Human Action 

sciences according to the pattern of physics or physiology only 
indulged in a way of thinking which popular fallacies had adopted 
long before. 

Even the classical economists were slow to free themselves from 
this error. With them value was something objective, ix., a phenom- 
enon of the external world and a quality inherent in things and there- 
fore measurable. They utterly failed to comprehend the pureIy hu- 
man and voluntaristic character of value judgments. As far as we can 
see today it was Samuel Bailey who first discloscd what is going on 
in preferring one thing to another.' But his book was overlooked as 
were the writings of other precursors of the subjective theory of value. 

It is not only a task of economic science to discard the errors con- 
cerning measurability in the field of action. It is no less a task of eco- 
nomic policy. For the failures of prcscnt-day economic policies are 
to some extent due to the lamentable confusion brought about by 
the idea that there is something fixed and therefore measurable in 
interhuman relations. 

4. Stabilization 
An outgrowth of all these errors is the idea of stabilization. 

Shortcomings in the governments' handling of monetary matters 
and the disastrous consequences of policies aimed at lowering the 
rate of interest and at encouraging business activities through credit 
expansion gave birth to the ideas which finally generated the slogan 
"stabilization." One can explain its emergence and its popular appeal, 
one can understand it as the fruit of the last hundred and fifty years' 
history of currency and banking, one can, as it were, plead extenu- 
ating circumstances for the error invohed. But no such sympathetic 
appreciation can render its fallacies any more tenable. 

Stability, the establishment of which the program of stabilization 
aims at, is an empty and contradictory notion. The urge toward 
action, i.e., improvement of the conditions of iife, is inborn in man. 
Man himself changes from moment to momcnt and his valuations, 
volitions, and acts change with him. In the realm of action there is 
nothing perpetual but change. There is no fixed point in this cease- 
less fluctuation other than the eternal aprioristic categories of action. 
It is vain to sever valuation and action from man's unsteadiness and the 
changcability of his conduct and to argue as if there were in the

Causes of Values. London, 1825.No. 7 in Series of Reprints of Scarce Tracts in

universe eternal values independent of human value judgments and 
suitable to serve as a yardstick for the appraisal of real actions2 

All methods suggested for a measurement of the changes in the 
monetary unit's purchasing power are more or less unwittingly 
founded on the illusory image of an eternal and immutable being who 
determines by the application of an immutable standard the quantity 
of satisfaction which a unit of money conveys to him. It is a poor 
justification of this ill-thought idea that what is wanted is merely 
to measure changes in the ~urchasing power of money. The crux 
of the stability notion lies precisely in this concept of p~zrchasing 
power. The layman, laboring under the ideas of physics, once con- 
sidered money as a yardstick of prices. He believed that fluctuations 
of exchange ratios occur only in the reIations between the various 
commodities and services and not also in the relation between money 
and the "totality" of goods and services. Later, people reversed the 
argument. It was no longer money to which constancy of value was 
attributed, but the "totality" of things vendible and purchasable. 
Pcople began to devise methods for working up complexes of com- 
modity units to bc contrasted to the monetary unit. Eagerness to 
find indexes for the measurement of purchasing power silenced all 
scruples. Both the doubtfulness and the incomparability of the price 
records employed and the arbitrary character of the procedures used 
for the computation of averages were disregarded. 

Irving Fisher, the eminent economist, who was the champion of 
the American stabilization movement, contrasts with the dollar a 
basket containing all the goods the housewife buys on the market for 
the current provision of her household. In the proportion in which 
the amount of money required for the purchase of the content of 
this basket changes, the purchasing power of the dollar has changed. 
The goal assigned to the policy of stabilization is the preservation of 
the immutability of this money expenditur~.~ 

This would be all right 

if the housewife and her imaginary basket were constant elements, if 

the basket were always to contain the same goods and the same quan- 

tity of each and if the role which this assortment of goods plays in 

the family's lifc were not to change. But we are living in a world in 

which none of these conditions is realized. 

First of all there is the fact that the quality of the commodities 

produced and consumed changes continuously. It is a mistake to

identify wheat with wheat, not to speak of shoes, hats, and other 
manufactures. The great price differences in the synchronous sales 
of commodities which mundane speech and statistics arrange in the 
same class clearly evidence this truism. An idiomatic expression as- 
serts that two peas are alike; but buyers and sellers distinguish various 
qualities and grades of peas. A comparison of prices paid at different 
places or at different dates for commodities which technology or 
statistics call by the same name, is useless if it is not certain that their 
qualities-but for the place difference-are perfectly the same. Qual- 
ity means in this connection: all those properties to which the buyers 
and would-be-buyers pay heed. The mere fact that the quality df all 
goods and services of the first order is subject to change explodes one 
of the fundamental assumptiqns of all index number methods. It is 
irrelevant that a limited amount of goods of the higher orders- 
especially metals and chemicals which can be uniquely determined 
by a formula-are liable to a precise description of their characteristic 
features. A measurement of purchasing power wouId have to rely 
upon the prices of the goods and services of the first order and, what 
is more, of all of them. To employ the prices of the producers' goods 
is not hclpful because it could not avoid counting the various stages 
of the production of one and the same consumers' good several times 
and thus falsifying the result. A restriction to a group of selected goods 
would be quite arbitrary and therefore vicious. 

But even apart from all these insurmountable obstacles the task 
would remain insoluble. For not only do the technological features of 
commodities change and new kinds of goods appear while many old 
ones disappear. Valuations change too, and they cause changes in 
demand and production. The assumptions of the measurement doc- 
trine would require men whose wants and valuations are rigid. Only 
if people were to value the same things always in the same way, could 
we consider price changes as expressive of changes in the power of 
rnoney to buy things. 

As it is impossible to establish the total amount of rnoney spent 
at a given fraction of time for consumers' goods, statisticians must 
rely upon the prices paid for individual commodities. This raises two 
further problems for which there is no apodictic solution. It becomes 
necessary to attach to the various commodities coefficients of im- 
portance. It would be manifestly wrong to let the prices of various 
commodities enter into the computation without taking into account 
the different roles they play in the total system of the individuals' 
households. But the establishment of such proper weighting is again 
arbitrary. Secondly, it becomes necessary to compute averages out 


The Sphere of Economic Calculation 

of the data collected and adjusted. But there exist different methods 
for the computation of averages. There are the arithmetic, the geo- 
metric, the harmonic averages, there is the quasi-average Imown as 
the median. Each of them leads to different results. None of them 
can be recognized as the unique way to attain a logically unassailable 
answer. The decision in favor of one of these methods of computation 
is arbitrary. 

If all human conditions were unchangeable, if all people were al-
ways to repeat the same actions because their uneasiness and their 
ideas about its rcmoval were constant, or if we wcre in a position to 
assume that changes in these factors occurring with some individuals 
or groups are always outweighed by opposite changes with other 
individuals or groups and therefore do not affect total demand and 
total supply, we would live in a world of stability. But the idea that 
in such a world money's purchasing power could change is,contradic- 
tory. As will be shown later, changes in the purchasing power of 
money must necessarily affect the prices of different commodities 
and services at different times and to diffcrcnt extents; they tnust con- 
sequently bring about changes in demand and supply, in production 
and cons~mption.~ 

The idea implied in the inappropriate term level 
of prices, as if-other things being equal-all prices could rise or 
drop cvenly, is untenable. Other things cannot remain equal if the 
purchasing power of money changes. 

In the field of praxeology and economics no sense can be given to 
the notion of measurement. In the hypothetical state of rigid condi- 
tions there are no changes to be measured. In the actual world of 
change there are no fixed points, dimensions, or relations which could 
serve as a standard. The monetary unit's purchasing power never 
changes evenly with regard to all things vendible and purchasable. 
The notions of stability and stabilization are empty if they do not 
refer to a state of rigidity and its preservation. However this state of 
rigidity cannot even be thought out consistently to its ultimate logical 
consequences; stiii iess can it be reaii~ed.~ 

TV'here there is action, there 
is change. Action is a lever of change. 

The prctentious solemnity which statisticians and statistical bureaus 
display in computing indexes of purchasing powcr and cost of living 
is out of place. These index numbers are at best rather crude and 
inaccurate illustrations of changes which have occurred. In periods 
of slow alterations in the relation between the supply of and the de- 
mand for money they do not convey any information at all. In 

4. See below, pp. 408-410. 
5. Cf. below, pp. 249-251. 

periods of inflation and consequently of sharp price changes they 
provide a rough image of events which every individual experiences 
in his daily life. A judicious housewife knows much more about price 
changes as far as they affect her own household than the statistical 
averages can tell. She has little use for compntations disregarding 
changes both in quality and in the amount of goods which she is 
able or permitted to buy at the prices entering into the computation. 
If she "measures" the changes for her personal appreciation by tak-
ing the prices of only two or three commodities as a yardstick, she 
is no less "scientific" and no more arbitrary than the sophisticated 
mathematicians in choosing their methods for the manipulation of 
the data of the market. 

In practical life nobody lets himself be fooled by index numbers. 
Nobody agrees with the fiction that they are to be considered as 
measurempts. Where quantities are measured, all further doubts 
and disagreements concerning their dimensions cease. These ques- 
tions are settled. Nobody ventures to argue with the ~neteorologists 
about their measurements of temperature, humidity, atmospheric 
pressure, and other meteorological data. But on the other hand no- 
body acquiesces in an index number if he does not expect a personal 
advantage from its acknowledgment by public opinion. The estab- 
lishment of index numbers does not settle disputes; it merely shifts 
them into a field in which the dash of antagonistic opinions and in- 
terests is irreconcilable. 

Human action originates change. As far as there is human action 

there is no stability, but ceaseless alteration. The historical process 

is a sequence of changes. It is beyond the power of man to stop it and 

to bring about an age of stability in which all history comes to a 

standstill. It is man's nature to strive after improvement, to beget new 

ideas, and to rearrange the conditions of his life according to these 

ideas. 

The prices of the market are historical facts expressive of a state 

of affairs that prevailed at a definite instant of the irreversible historical 

process. In the praxeological orbit the concept of measurement does 

not make any sense. In the imaginary-and, of course, unrealizable- 

state of rigidity and stability there are no changes to be measured. Tn 

the actual world of permanent change there are no fixed points, ob- 

jects, qualities or relations with regard to which changes could be 

measured. 


The Sphere of Econowic Calculatio~z 

5. The Root of the Stabilization Idea 
Econo~nic calculation does not require monetary stability in the 
sense in which this term is used by the champions of the stabilization 
movement. The fact that rigidity in the monetary unit's purchasing 
power is unthinkable and unrealizable does not impair the methods 
of economic calculation. What economic calculation requires is a 
monetary system whose functioning is not sabotaged by government 
interference. The endeavors to expand the quantity of money in cir- 
culation either in order to increase the government's capacity to spend 
or in order to bring about a temporary lowering of the rate of in- 
terest disintegrate all currency matters and derange economic cal- 
culation. The first aim of monctary policy must be to prevent govern-
ments from embarking upon inflation and from creating conditions 
which encourage credit expansion on the part of banks. But this 
program is very different from the confused and self-contradictory 
program of stabilizing purchasing power. 

For the sake of economic calculation all that is needed is to avoid 
great and abrupt Auctuations in the supply of money. Gold and, up 
to the middle of the nineteenth century, silver served very well all the 
purposes of economic calculation. Changes in the relation between 
the supply of and the demand for the precious metals and the result- 
ing alterations in purchasing power went on so slowly that the 
entrepreneur's economic calculation could disregard them without 
going too far afield. Precision is unattainable in economic calculation 
quite apart from the shortcomings emanating from not paying due 
consideration to monetary change^.^ The planning businessman can- 
not help employing data concerning the unknown future; he deals 
with future prices and future costs of production. Accounting and 
bookkeeping in their endeavors to establish the result of past action 
are in the same position as far as they rely upon the estimation of 
fixed equipment, inventories, and receivables. In spite of all these 
uncertainties economic calculation can achieve its tasks. For these 
uncertainties do not stem from deficiencies of the system of calcula- 
tion. They are inherent in the essence of acting that always deals with 
the uncertain future. 

The idea of rendering purchasing power stable did not originate 

6. Incidentally, no practical calculation can ever be precise. The formu1a 
underlying the process of calculation may be exact; the calculation itself depends 
on the approximate establishment of quantities and is therefore necessarily in- 
accurate. Economics is, as has been shown above (p. 39), an exact science of 
real things. But as soon as price data are introduced into the chain of thought, 
exactitude is abandoned and economic history is substituted for economic theory 

Human Action 

from endeavors to make economic calculation more correct. Its 
source is the wish to create a sphere withdrawn from the ceaseless 
flux of human affairs, a realm which the historical process does not 
affect. Endowments which were designed to provide in perpetuity 
for an ecclesiastic body, for a charitable institution, or for a family 
were long established in land or in disbursement of agricultural prod- 
ucts in ltind. Latcr annuities to be settled in money were added. En- 
dowers and beneficiaries expected that an annuity determined in 
terms of a definite amount of precious metals would not be affected 
by changes in econon~ic conditions. But these hopes were iI1usory. 
Later generations learned that the plans of their ancestors were not 
reahzed. Stimulated by this experience they began to investigate how 
the aims sought could be attained. Thus they embarked upon attempts 
to measure changes in purchasing power and to eliminate such 
changes. 

The problem assumed much greater importance when govern- 
ments initiated their policies of long-term irredeemable and perpetual 
loans. The state, this new deity of the dawning age of statolatrv, this 
eternal and superhuman institution beyond the reach of earthly 
frailties, offered to the citizen an opportunity to put his wealth in 
safety and to enjoy a stable income secure against all vicissitudes. It 
opened a way to free the individual from the necessity of risking and 
acquiring his wealth and his income anew each day in the capitalist 
market. He who invested his funds in bonds issued by the government 
and its subdivisions was no longer subject to the inescapable laws 
of the market and to the sovereignty of the consumers. He was no 
longer under the necessity of investing his funds in such a way that 
they would best serve the wants and needs of the consumers. Re was 
secure, he was safeguarded against the dangers of the competitive 
market in which losses are the penalty of inefficiency; the eternal state 
had taken him under its wing and guaranteed him the undisturbed 
enjoyment of his funds. Henceforth his income no longer stemmed 
from the process of supplying the wants of the consumers in the 
best possible way. but from the taxes levied by the state's apparatus 
of compulsion and coercion. He was no longer a servant of his fellow 
citizens, subject to their sovereignty; hc was a partner of the govern- 
ment which ruled the people and exacted tribute from them. What 
the government paid as interest was Iess than the market offered. But 
this difference was far outweighed by the unquestionable solvency of 
the debtor, the state whose revenue did not depend on satisfying the 
public, but on insisting on the payment of taxes. 

In spite of the unpleasant experiences with public debts in earlier 


The Sphere of Economic CalcuEation 

days, people were ready to trust freely the modernized state of the 
nineteenth century. It was generally assumed that this new state 
would scrupulously meet its voluntarily contracted obligations. 
Capitalists and entrepreneurs were fully aware of the fact that in the 
market society there is no means of preserving acquired wealth other 
than by acquiring it anew each day in tough competition with every- 
body, with the already existing firms as we11 as with newcomers 
"operating on a shoe string." The entrepreneur, grown old and 
weary and no longer prepared to risk his hard-earned wealth by new- 
attempts to meet the wants of consumers, and the heir of other people's 
profits, lazy and fully conscious of his own inefficiency, preferred 
investmeniin bonds of the public debt because they wanted to be 
free from the law of the market. 

Now, the irredeemable perpetual public debt presupposes the 
srabilitv of purchasing power. Although the state and its compulsion 
may bk eternal, the interest paid on the public debt could be eternal 
only if based on a standard of unchanging value. In this form the 
investor who for security's sake shuns the market, entrepreneurship, 
and investment in free enterprise and prefers government bonds is 
faced again with the problem of the changeability of all human affairs. 
He discovers that in the frame of a market society there is no room 
left for wealth not dependent upon the market. His endeavors to 
find an inexhaustible source of income fail. 

There are in this world no such things as stability and security and 
no human endeavors are powerful enough to bring them about. There 
is in the social system of the market society no other means of ac- 
@ring wealth and of preserving it than successful service to the 
consumers. The state is, of course, in a position to exact payments 
from its subjects and to borrow funds. However, even the most 
ruthless government in the long run is not able to defy thc laws 
determining human life and action. If the government uses the sums 
borrowed for investment in those lines in which they best serve the 
wants of the consumers, and if it succeeds in these entrepreneurial 
activities in free and equal competition with all private entrepreneurs, 
it is in the same position as any other businessman; it can pay interest 
because it has made surpluses. But if the government invests funds 
~insucccssfully and no surplus results, or if it spends the monev for 
current expenditure, the capital borrowed shrinks or disappeak en- 
tirely, and no source is opened from which interest and principal could 
bc paid. Then taxing the people is the only method available for 
complying with the articles of the credit contract. In asking taxes 

for such payments the government makes the citizens answerable for 


Human Action 

money squandered in the past. The taxes paid are not compensated 
by any present service rendered by the government's apparatus. 
The government pays interest on capital which has been consumed 
and no longer exists. The treasury is burdened with the unfortunate 
results of past policies. 

A good case can be made out for short-term government debts 
under special conditions. Of course, the popular justiiication of war 
loans is nonsensical. All the materials needed for the conduct of a 
war must be provided by restriction of civilian consumption, by 
using up a part of the capital available and by working harder. The 
whole burden of warring falls upon the living generation. The com- 
ing generations are only affected to the extent to which, on account 
of the war expenditure, they will inherit less from those now living 
than they would have jf no war had been fought. Financing a war 
through'loans does not shift the burden to the sons and grandson^.^ 
It is merely a method of distributing the burden among the citizens. 
If the whole expenditure had to be provided by taxes, only those 
who have liquid funds could be approached. The rest of the people 
would not contribute adequately. Short-term loans can be instru- 
mental in removing such inequalities, as they allow for a fair assess- 
ment on the owners of fixed capital. 

The long-term public and semipublic credit is a foreign and dis- 
turbing element in the structure of a market society. Its establish- 
ment was a futile attempt to go beyond the limits of human action 
and to create an orbit of security and eternity removed from the 
transitorincss and instability of earthly affairs. What an arrogant 
presumption to borrow and to lend money for ever and ever, to make 
contracts for eternity, to stipulate for all times to come! In this 
respect it mattered little whether the loans were in a formal manner 
made irredeemable or not; intentionally and practicalIy they were 
as a rule considered and dealt with as such. In the heyday of liberalism 
some Western nations really retired parts of their long-term debt by 
honest reimbursement. But for the most part new debts were only 
heaped upon old ones. The financial history of the last century shows 
a steady increase in the amount of public indebtedness. Nobody be- 
lieves that the states will eternally drag the burden of these inierest 
payments. It is obvious that sooner or later all these debts will be 
liquidated in some way or other, but certainly not by payment of 
interest and principal according to the terms of the contract. A host

available for lending. We do not refer here to credit expansion of which the main 
vehicle in present-day America is borrowing from the commercial banks.

of sophisticated writers are already busy elaborating the moral 
palhation for the day of final settlement." 

The fact that economic calculation in terms of money is unequal to 
the tasks which are assigned to it in these illusory schemes for estab- 
lishment of an unrealizable realm of calm removed from the inescap- 
able limitations of human action and providing eternal security can- 
not be called a deficiency. There are no such things as eternal, abso- 
lute, and unchanging values. The search for a standard of such values 
is vain, Economic calculation is not imperfect because it does not 
correspond to the confused ideas of people yearning for a stable in- 
come not dependent on the productive processes of men. 

8. The most popular of these doctrines is crystallized in the phrase: A public 
debt is no burden because we owe it to ourselves. If this were true, then the 
wholesale obliteration of the public debt would be an innocuous operation, a 
mere act of bookkeeping and accountancy. The fact is that the public debt 
embodies claims of people who have in the past entrusted funds to the govern- 
ment against all those who are daily producing new wealth. It burdens the pro- 
ducing strata for the benefit of another part of the people. It is possible to free 
the producers of new wealth from this burden by collecting the taxes required 
for the payments exclusively from the bondholders. But this means undisguised 
repudiation. 

XIII. MONETARY CALCULATION AS A TOOL 
OF ACTION 

I. Monetary Calculation as a Method of Thinking 
M 
M
ONETARY calculation is the guiding star of action under the 
social system of division of labor. It is the compass of the man 
embarking upon production. He calculatcs in order to distinguish 
the remunerative lines of production from the unprofitable ones, 
those of which the sovereign consumers are likely to approve from 
those of which they are likely to disapprove. Every single step of 
entrepreneurial activities is subject to scrutiny by monetary cal- 
culation. The premeditation of planned action becomes commercial 
precalculation of expected costs and expected proceeds. The retro- 
spective establishment of the outcome of past action becomes account- 
ing of profit and loss. 

The system of economic calculation in monetary terms is condi- 
tioned by certain social institutions. It can operate only in an in- 
stitutional setting of the division of labor and private ownership of the 
means of production in which goods and services of all orders are 
bought and sold against a generally used medium of exchange, i.e., 
money. 

Monetary calculation is the method of calculating cmploycd by 
people acting within the frame of society based on private control of 
the means of production. It is a device of acting individuals; it is a 
mode of computation designed for ascertaining private wealth and 
income and private profits and losses of individuals acting on their 
own behalf within a free enterprise society.= All its results refer to the 
actions of individuals only. When statisticians summarize these results, 
the outcome shows the sum of the autonomous actions of a plurality 
of self-directing individuals, but not the effect of the action of a 
collective body, of a whole, or of a totality. Monetary calculation is 
entirely inapplicable and useless for any consideration which does not 
look at things from the point of view of individuals. It involves cal- 
dating the individuals' profits, not imaginary "social" values and 
"social" welfare. 

I. In partnerships and corporations it is always individuals who act, although 
not only one individual. 

Monetary Calculation as a Tool of Action 

Monetary calculation is the main vehicle of planning and acting 
in the social setting of a society of free enterprise directed and con- 
trolled by the market and its prices. It developed in this frame and was 
gradually perfected with the improvement of the market mechanism 
and with the cxpansiori of the scope of things which are negotiated 
on markets against money. It was economic calculation that assigned 
to measurement, number, and reckoning the role thcy play in our 
quantitative and computing civiIization. The measurements of physics 
and chcrnistry make sense for practical action only because there is 
economic calculation. It is monetary calculation that made arithmetic 
a tool in the struggle for a better life. It provides a mode of using 
the achievements of laboratory cxperiments for the most efficacious 
removal of uneasiness. 

Monetary calculation reaches its fulI pcrfection in capital account- 
ing. It establishes the money prices of the available means and con- 
fronts this total with the changes brought about by action and by 
the operation of other factors. This confrontation shows what changes 
occurred in the state of the acting men's affairs, and the magnitude of 
those changes; it makes success and failure, profit and loss ascertain- 
able. The system of free cnterprise has been dubbed capitalism in 
order to deprccate and to smcar it. However, this term can be con- 
sidered very pertinent. It refers to the most characteristic feature of 
the system, its main eminence, viz. the role the notion of capital plays 
in its conduct. 

There are people to whom monetary calculation is repulsive. They 
do not want to be rouscd from their daydrcams by the voice of critical 
reason. Reality sickens thcm, they long for a realm of unlimited op-
portunity. They are disgusted by the meanness of a social order in 
which everything is nicely reckoned in dollars and pennies. They 
call their grumbling the noble deportment worthy of the friends of 
the spirit, of beauty, and virtue as opposed to the ignoble baseness 
and villainy of Babbittry. However, the cult of beauty and virtue, 
wisdom and the search for truth are not hindered by the rationality 
of the calculating and computing mind. It is only romantic reverie 
that cannot thrive in a milieu of sober criticism. The cool-headed 
reckoner is the stern chastiser of the ecstatic visionary. 

Our civilization is inseparably linked with our methods of eco-

nomic calculation. It would perish if we were to abandon this most 

precious intellectual tool of acting. Goethe was right in calling book- 

keeping by doublc entry "one of the finest inventions of the human 

mind." "

Human Action 

2. Economic Calculation and the Science of 
Human Action 
The evolution of capitalist economic calculation was the neces- 
sary condition for the establishment of a systematic and logically 
coherent science of human action. Praxeology and economics have 
a definite place in the evolution of human history and in the process 
of scientific research. They could only emerge when acting man 
had succeeded in creating methods of thinking that rnade it possible 
to calculate his actions. The science of human action was at the 
beginning merely a discipline dealing with those actions which can 
be tested by monetary calculation. It dealt exclusively with what we 
may call the orbit of economics in the narrower sense, that is, with 
those actions which within a market society are transacted by the 
intermediary of money. The first steps on the way to its elaboration 
were odd investigations concerning currency, moneylending, and the 
~ricesof various goods. The knowledge conveyed by Gresham's Law, 
the first crude formulations of the quantity theory of money-such 
as those of Bodin and Davanzati-and the Law of Gregory King 
mark the first dawn of the cognition that regularity of phenomena 
and inevitable necessity prevail in the field of action. The first com- 
prehensive system of economic theory, that brilliant achievement of 
the classical economists, was essentially a theory of cakulated action. 
It drew implicitly the borderline between what is to be considered 
economic and what extra-economic along the line which separates 
action calculated in monetary terms from other action. Starting 
from this basis the economists were bound to widen step by step the 
field of their studies until they finally developed a system dealing 
with a11 human choices, a general theory of action.

Catullactics or Economics of the Market Society 


XIV. THE SCOPE AND METHOD OF CATALLAC'TICS 
r . The Delimitation of Catallactic Problems 
T 
T
MERE have never been any doubts and uncertainties about the 
scope of economic science. Ever since people have been eager 
for a systematic study of economics or political economy, all have 
agreed that it is the task of this branch of knowledge to investigate 
the market phenomena, that is, the determination of the mutual ex- 
change ratios of the goods and services negotiated on markets, their 
origin in human action and their effects upon later action. The in- 
tricacy of a precise definition of the scope of economics does not 
stem from uncertainty with regard to the orbit of the phenomena 
to be investigated. It is due to the fact that the attempts to elucidate 
the phenomena concerned must go beyond the range of the market 
and of market transactions. In order to conceive the market fully 
one is forced to study the action of hypothetical isolated individuals 
on one hand and to-contrast the ma& system with an imaginary 
socialist commonwealth on the other hand. In studying interpersonal 
exchange one cannot avoid dealing with autistic exchange. But then 
it is no longer possible to define neatly the boundaries between the 
kind of action which is the proper field of economic science in 
the narrower sense, and other action. Economics widens its horizon 
and turns into a general science of all and every human action, into 
praxeology. The question emerges of how to distinguish precisely, 
within the broader field of general praxeoIogy, a narrower orbit of 
specifically economic problems. 

The abortive attempts to solve this problem of a precise delimita- 
tion of the scope of catallactics have chosen as a criterion either the 
motives causing action or the goals which action aims at. But the 
variety and manifoldness of the motives instigating a man's action is 
without relevance for a comprehensive study of acting. Every action 
is motivated by the urge to remove a felt uneasiness. It does not mat- 
ter for the science of action how people qualify this uneasiness from 
a physiological, psychological, or ethical point of view. It is the task 
of economics to deal with all commodity prices as they are really 
asked and paid in market transactions. It must not restrict its investi- 


Human Action 

gations to the study of those prices which result or are likely to 
rcsult from a conduct displaying attitudes to which psychology, 
ethics, or any other way of looking at human behavior would attach 
a definite label. The classification of actions according to their various 
motives may be momentous for psychology and may provide a yard- 
stick for a moral evaluation; for economics it is inconsequential. Es- 
sentially the same is valid with regard to the endeavors to restrict the 
scope of economics to those actions which aim at supplying people 
with tangible material things of the external universe. Strictly speak- 
ing, people do not Iong for tangible goods as such, but for the serv- 
ices which these goods are fitted to render them. They want to attain 
the increment in well-being which these services are able to convey. 
Rut if this is so, it is not permissible to except from the orbit of "eco- 
nomic" action those actions which removc uneasiness directly with- 
out the interposition of any tangible and visible things. The advice of 
a doctor, the instruction of a teacher, the recital of an artist, and other 
personal services are no less an object of economic studies than the 
architect's plans for the construction of a building, the scientist's 
formula for the production of a chemical con~pound, and the author's 
contribution to the publishing of a book. 

The subject matter of catallactics is all market phenomena with all 
their roots, ramifications, and consequences. It is a fact that people in 
dealing on the market are motivated not only by the desire to get 
food, shelter, and sexual enjoyment, but also by manifold "ideal" 
urges. Acting man is always concerned both with "material" and 
"ideal" things. He chooses between various alternatives, no matter 
whether they are to be classified as material or ideal. In the actual scales 
of value material and ideal things are jumbled together. Even if it 
were feasible to draw a sharp line between material and ideal con- 
cerns, one must realize that every concrete action either aims at the 
realization both of material and ideal ends or is thc outcome of a 
choice between something material and something ideal. 

Whether it is possible to separate neatly those actions which aim 
at the satisfaction of needs exclusively conditioned by man's physio- 
logical constitution from othcr "higher" needs can be left undecided. 
But we must not overlook the fact that in reality no food is valued 
solely for its nutritive power and no garment or house solely for the 
protection it affords against cold weather and rain. It cannot be denied 
that the demand for goods is widely influenced by metaphysical, 
religious, and ethical considerations, by aesthetic value judgments, by 
customs, habits, prejudices, tradition, changing fashions, and many 
other things. To an cconomist who would try to restrict his investi- 


The Scope and Method of Catallactics 

gations to "material" aspects only, the subject matter of inquiry 
vanishes as soon he wants to catch it. 

All that can be contended is this: Econon~ics is mainly concerned 
with the analysis of the determination of money prices of goods and 
services exchanged on the market. In order to accomplish this task 
it must start from a comprehensive theory of human action. More- 
over, it must study not only the market phenomena, but no less the 
hypothetical conduct of an isolated man and of a socialist community. 
Finally, it must not restrict its investigations to those modes of action 
which in mundane speech are called "economic" actions, but must 
deal also with actions which are in a loose manncr of speech called 
'L~ne~on~nli~." 

The scope of praxeology, the genera1 theory of human action, can 
be precisely defined and circumscribed. The specifically economic 
problems, the problems of economic action in the narrower sense, 
can only by and large be disengaged from the comprehensive body 
of praxeological theory. Accidental facts of the history of science and 
conventions play a role in all attempts to provide a definition of the 
scope of "genuine" economics. 

Not logical or epistemological rigor, but considerations of ex-
pediency and traditional convention make us declare that the field of 
cataIlactics or of economics in the narrower sense is the analysis of 
the market phenomena. This is tantamount to the statement: Catal- 
lactics is the analysis of those actions which are conductcd on the 
basis of monetary calculation. Market exchange and monetary cal- 
culation are inseparably linked together. A market in which there 
is direct exchange only is merely an imaginary construction. On the 
other hand, money and monetary calculation are conditioned by the 
existence of the market. 

It is certainly one of the tasks of economics to analyze the work- 
ing of an imaginary socialist systcm of production. Rut access to this 
study too is possible only through the study of catallactics, the elucida- 
tion of a systcm in which there are money prices and economic cal- 
culation. 

The Denial of Econonzics 

There are doctrines flatly denying that there can be a science of eco- 
nomics. What is taught nowadays at most of the universities under the 
label of economics is practically a denial of it. 

He who contests the existence of economics virtually denies that man's 
well-being is disturbed by any scarcity of external factors. Everybody, 
he implies, could enjoy the perfect satisfaction of all his wishes, provided 
a reform succeeds in overcoming certain obstacles brought about by inap- 


Human Action 

propriate man-made institutions. h'ature is open-handed, it lavishly loads 
mankind with presents. Conditions could be paradisiac for an indefinite 
number of people. Scarcity is an artificial product of established practices. 
The abolition of such practices would result in abundance. 

In the doctrine of Karl Marx and his followers scarcity is a historical 
category only. It is the feature of the primeval history of mankind which 
will be forever liquidated by the abolition of private property. Once man- 
kind has effected the leap from the realni of necessity into the realm of 
freedom and thereby reached "the higher phase of comniunist society" 
there will be abundance and consequently it will he feasible to give "to 
each according to his needs." There is in the vast flood of Marxian writ- 
ings not the slightest allusion to the possibility that a communist society in 
its "higher phase" might have to face a scarcity of natural factors of pro- 
duction. The fact of the disutility of labor is spirited away by the assertion 
that to work, under communism of course, will no longer be pain but 
pleasure, "the primary necessity of life." The unpleasant experiences of 
the Russian "experiment" are interpreted as caused by the capitalists' 
hostility, by the fact that socialism in one country only is not yet perfect 
and therefore has not yet been able to bring about the "higher phase," and, 
more recently, by the war. 

Then there are the radical inflationists as represented, for example, by 
Proudhon, Ernest Solvay, and, in present-day America, by the doctrine of 
"functional finance." In their opinion scarcity is created by the artificial 
checks upon credit expansion and other methods of increasing the quantity 
of money in circulation, enjoined upon the gullible public by the selfish 
class interests of bankers and other exploiters. They recommend unlimited 
public spending as the panacea. 

The foremost American champion of the substjtution of an economy of 
abundance for the aIIegedly artificial economy of scarcity is the former 
Vice-president of the United States, Henry A. Wallace. 1Mr. Wallace will 
be remembered in history as the originator of the vastest scheme ever 
carried out to restrict by government decree the supply of essential food- 
stuffs and raw materials. However, this record in no way impairs the popu- 
larity of his teachings. 

Such is the myth of potential plenty and abundance. Economics may 
leave it to the historians and psychologists to explain the popularity of this 
kind of wishful thinking and indulgence in daydreams. All that economics 
has to say about such idle talk is that economics deals with the problems 
man has to face on account of the fact that his life is conditioned by natural 
factors. It deals with action, i.e., with the conscious endeavors to remove 
as far as possible felt uneasiness. It has nothing to assert with regard to the

state of affairs in an unrealizable and for human reason even inconceivable 
universe of unlimited opportunities. In such a world, it may be admitted, 
there will be no law of value, no scarcity, and no economic problems. 
These things will be absent because there will be no choices to be made, 
no action, and no tasks to be solved by reason. Beings which would have 
thrived in such a world would never have developed reasoning and think- 
ing. If ever such a world were to be given to the descendants of the human 
race, these blessed beings would see their power to think wither away and 
would cease to be human. For the primary task of reason is to cope con- 
sciously with the limitations imposed upon man by nature, to fight against 
scarcity. Acting and thinking man is the product of a universe of scarcity 
in which whatever well-being can be attained is the prize of toil and 
trouble, of conduct popularly called economic. 

2. The Method of Imaginary Constructions 
The specific method of economics is the method of imaginary con- 
structions. 

This method is the method of praxeology. That it has been care- 
fully elaborated and perfectcd in the field of economic studies in the 
narrower sense is due to the fact that economics, at least until now, 
has been the best-developed part of praxcology. Everyone who wants 
to express an opinion about the problems commonly called economic 
takes recourse to this method. The employment of these imaginary 
constructions is, to be sure, not a procedure peculiar to the scientific 
analysis of these problems. The layman in dealing with them resorts 
to the same method. But while the layman's constructions are more 
or less confused and muddled, economics is intent upon elaborating 
them with the utmost care, scrupulousness, and precision, and upon 
examining their conditions and assumptions critically. 

An imaginary construction is a conceptual image of a sequence of 
cvents logically evolved from the elements of action employed in its 
formation. It is a product of deduction, ultimately derived from the 
fundamental category of action, the act of preferring and setting 
aside. In designing such an imaginary construction the economist is 
not concerned with the question of whether or not it depicts the 
conditions of reality which he wants to analyze. Nor does he bother 
about the question of whether or not such a system as his imaginary 
construction posits could be conceived as really existent and in opera- 
tion. Even imaginary constructions which are inconceivable, self- 
contradictory, or unrealizable can render useful, even indispensable 
services in the comprehension of reality, provided the economist 
knows how to use them properly. 


Human Action 

The method of imaginary constructions is justificd by its success. 
Praxeology cannot, likc the natural sciences, base its teachings upon 
laboratory experiments and sensory perception of cxternal objects. 
It had to develop methods entirely different from those of physics 
and biology. It would be a serious blunder to look for analogies to the 
imaginary constructions in the field of the natural sciences. The 
imaginary constructions of praxeology can never be confronted with 
any expcrience of things external and can never be appraised from 
the point of view of such experience. Their function is to serve man 
in a scrutiny which cannot rely upon his senses. In confronting the 
imaginary constructions with reality we cannot raise the question of 
whether they correspond to cxperiencc and depict adequatcly the 
empirical data. We must ask whether the assumptions of our con- 
struction are identical uith the conditions of those actions which we 
want to conceivc. 

The main formula for designing of imaginary constructions is to 
abstract from the operation of some conditions present in actual 
action. Then we are in a position to grasp the hypothetical conse- 
quences of the absence of these conditions and to conceive the effects 
of their existence. Thus wc conceive the category of action by con- 
structing the image of a state in which there is no action, cither be- 
cause the individual is fully contented and does not feel any uneasiness 
or because he does not know any procedure from which an improve- 
ment in his well-being (state of satisfaction) could be expected. Thus 
we conceive the notion of originary interest from an imaginary con- 
struction in which no distinction is made betwccn satisfactions in 
periods of time equal in length but unequal with regard to their dis- 
tance from the instant of action. 

The rncthod of imaginary constructions is indispensable for prax- 
eology; it is the only method of praxcological and economic inquiry. 
It is, to be sure, a method very difficult to handle because it can easily 
result in fallacious syllogisms. It leads along a sharp edge; on both sides 
yawns the chasm of absurdity and nonsense. Only merciless self- 
criticism can prevent a man from falling headlong into these abysmal 
depths. 

3. The Pure Market Economy 
The imaginary construction of a pure or unhampered marker 
economy assumes that there is division of labor and private owner- 
ship (control) of the means of production and that consequently 
there is market exchange of goods and services. It assumes that the 


The Scope and Method of Catallactics 2 39 

operation of the market is not obstructed by institutional factors. It 
assumes that the government, the social apparatus of compulsion and 
coercion, is intent upon preserving the operation of thc market system, 
abstains from hindering its functioning, and protects it against en- 
croachments on the part of other people. The market is free; there 
is no interference of factors, foreign to the market, with prices, wage 
rates, and interest rates. Starting from thcse assumptions economics 
tries to elucidate the operation of a pure market economy. Only at 
a later stage, having exhausted everything which can be learned from 
the study of this imaginary construction, does it turn to the study of 
the various problems raised by interference with the markct on the 
part of governments and other agencies employing coercion and corn- 
pulsion. 

It is amazing that this logically incontestable procedure, the only 
one that is fitted to solve the problems involved, has been passionately 
attacked. Yeoplc have branded it as a prepossession in favor of a 
liberal economic policy, which they stigmatke as reactionary, eco- 
nomic royalism, &lanchcsterism, negativism, and so on. They deny 
that anything can be gained for the Imovdedge of reaXty from occupa- 
tion with this imaginary construction. However, these turbulent 
critics contradict thernsclves as they take recourse to the same method 
in advancing their own assertions. In asking for minimum wage rates 
thev depict the alleged unsatisfactory conditions of a free labor mar- 
kctand in asking for tariffs they describe the alleged disasters brought 
about by free trade. There is, of course, no other way available for 
the elucidation of a measure limiting the free play of the factors 
operating on an unhampered market than to study first the state of 
affairs prevailing under cconomic freedom. 

It is true that economists have drawn from their investigations the 
conclusion that the goals which most people, practically even all 
people, are intent on attaining by toiling and working and by eco- 
nomic policy, can best be realized where the free market system is 
not impcded hy govcrnment decrees. But this is not a preconceived 
judgment stemming from an insufficient occupation with the opera- 
tion of government interference with business. It is, on the contrary, 
the result of a careful, unbiased scrutiny of all aspccts of interven- 
tionism. 

It is also true that the classical economists and their epigones used 
to call the system of unhampered market economy "naturaIn and 
government meddling with market phenomena "artificial" and "dis- 
turbing." Rut this terminology also was the product of their careful 
scrutiny of the problems of interventionism. They were in con-


Human Action 

formity with the semantic practice of their age in calling an undesir- 
able state of social affairs "contrary to nature." 

Theism and Deism of the Age of Enlightenment viewed the regu- 
larity of natural phenomena as an emanation of the decrees of Provi- 
dence. When the philosophers of the Enlightenment discovered that 
there prevails a regularity of phenomena also in human action and in 
social evolution, they were prepared to interpret it likewise as evi- 
dence of the patcrnal care of the Creator of the universe. This was 
the true meaning of the doctrine of the predetermined harmony as 
expounded by some economist^.^ The social philosophy of patkrnal 
despotism laid stress upon the divine mission of kings and autocrats 
predestined to rule the peoples. The liberals retorted that the operation 
of an unhampered market, on which the consumer-it., every citizen 
-is sovereign, brings about more satisfactory results than the decrees 
of anointed rulers. Observe the functioning of the market system, 
they said, and you will discover in it the finger of God. 

Along with the imaginary construction of a pure market economy 
the classical economists elaborated its logical counterpart, the im- 
aginary construction of a socialist commonwealth. In the heuristic 
process which finally led to the discovery of the operation of a 
market economy this image of a socialist order even had logical 
priority. The question which preoccupied the economists was whether 
a tailor could be supplied with bread and shoes if there was no gov- 
ernment decree compelling the baker and the shoemaker to provide 
for his needs. The first thought was that authoritarian interference is 
required to make every specialist serve his fellow citizens. The 
economists were taken aback when they discovered that no such 
compulsion is needed. In contrasting productivity and profitability, 
self-interest and public welfare, selfishness and altruism, the econo- 
mists implicitly referred to the image of a socialist system. Their 
astonishment at the "automatic," as it were, steering of the market 
system was preciseIy due to the fact that they realized that an "an- 
archic" state of production results in supplying people better than 
the orders of a centralized omnipotent government. The idea of 
socialism-a system of the division of labor entirely controlled and 
managed by a planning authority-did not originate in the heads of 
utopian reformers. These utopians aimed rather at the autarkic co- 
existence of small self-sufficient bodies; take, for instance, Fourier's 
phalange. The radicalism of the reformers turned toward socialism 

4. The doctrine of the predetermined harmony in the operation of an un- 
hampered market system must not be confused with the theorem of the harmony 
of the rightly understood interests within a market system, although there is a 
certain congeniality between them. Cf. below, pp. 669-678.

government or a world authority, implied in rhe theories of the econ- 
omists, as a model for their new order. 

The M~ximizatio?~ Profits

of 

It is generally believed that economists, in dealing with the problems of 
a tnarket economy, are quite unrealistic in assuming that all men are always 
eager to gain the highest attainable advantage. They construct, it is said, 
the image of a perfectly selfish and rationalistic being for whom nothing 
counts but ~rofit. Such a homo oeconomicus may be a likeness of stock 
jobbers and speculators. But the immense majority are very different. 
Nothing for the cognition of reality can be learned from the study of the 
conduct of this delusive image. 

It is not necessary to enter again into a refutation of all the confusion, 
error, and distortion inherent in this contention. The first two parts of this 
book have unmasked the fallacies implied. At this point it is enough to 
deal with the problem of the maximization of profits. 

Praxeology in general and economics in its special field assume with 
regard to the springs of human action nothing other than that acting man 
wants to remove uneasiness. Under the particular conditions of dealing on 
the market, action means buying and selling. Everything that economics 
asserts about demand and supply refers to every instance of demand and 
supply and not only to demand and supply brought about by some special 
circumstances requiring a particular description or definition. To assert 
that a man, faced with the alternative of getting more or Iess for a com- 
modity he wants to sell, ceteris paribus chooses the high price, does not 
require any further assunlption. A higher price means for the seller a better 
satisfaction of his wants. The same applies mutatis mutandis to the buyer. 
The amount saved in buying the commodity concerned enables him to 
spend more for the satisfaction of other needs. To buy in the cheapest 
market and to sell in the dearest market is, other things being equal, not 
conduct which would presuppose any special assumptions concerning the 
actor's motives and morality. It is merely the necessary offshoot of any 
action under the conditions of market exchange. 

In his capacity as a businessman a man is a servant of the consumers, 
bound to conlply with their wishes. He cannot indulge in his own whims 
and fancies. But his customers' whims and fancies are for him ultimate law, 
provided these customers are ready to pay for them. He is under the neces- 
sity of adjusting his conduct to the demand of the consumers. If the con- 
sumers, without a taste for the beautiful, prefer things ugly and vulgar, he 
must, contrary to his own convictions, supply them with such things.5 If 
consumers do not want to pay a higher price for domestic products than

be sold at the highest price. A painter who does not compromise with the taste 
of the buving public and, disdaining dl unpleasant consequences, lets himself be 
guided solely by his own ideals is an artist,a creative genius. Cf. above, pp. I 38-1 40. 

Human Action 

for those produced abroad, he must buy the foreign product, provided it 
is cheaper. An employer cannot grant favors at the expense of his cus- 
tomers. He cannot pay wage rates higher than those determined by the 
market if the buyers are not ready to pay proportionately higher prices 
for comnlodities produced in plants in which wage rates are higher than 
in other plants. 

It is different with man in his capacity as spender of his income. He is 
free to do what he likes best. He can bestow alms. He can, motivated by 
various doctrines and prcjudices, discriminate against goods of a certain 
origin or source and prefer the worse or more expensive product to the 
-technoIogically-better and cheaper one. As a rule pcople in buying do 
not make gifts to the seller. But nonetheless that happens. The boundaries 
between buying goods and services needed and giving alms are sometimes 
difficult to discern. He who buys at a charity sale usually combines a pur- 
chase with a donation for a charitable purpose. He who gives a dime to a 
blind street musician certainly does not pay for the questionable perform- 
ance; he simply gives alms. 

lMan in acting is a unity. The businessman who owns the whole firm 
may sometimes efface the boundaries between business and charity. If he 
wants to relieve a distressed friend, delicacy of feeling may prompt him 
to resort to a procedure which spares the latter the embarrassment of living 
on alms. I-Te gives the friend a job in his office although he does not need 
his help or could hire an equivalent helper at a lower salary. Then thc 
salary granted appears formally as a part of business outlays. In fact it is 
the spending of a fraction of the businessman's income. It is, from a correct 
point of view, consumption and not an expenditure designed to increase 
the firm's pr~fits.~ 

Awkward mistakes are due to the tendency to look only upon things 
tangible, visible, and rncasurable. and to neglect everything else. What the 
consumer buys is not simply food or calories. He does not want to feed like 
a wolf, he wants to eat like a man. Food satisfies the appetite of many 
people the better, the morc appetizingly and tastefully it is prepared, the 
finer the table is set, and the more agreeable the environment is in which 
the food is consumed. Such things are regarded as of no consequence by 
a consideration exclusirdy occupied with the chernjcal aspects of rhe 
process of digestion.7 But the fact that they play an important role in the 
determination of food prices is perfectly compatible with the assertion 
that people prefer. ceteris paribus, to buy in the cheapest market. When- 
ever a buyer. in choosing between two things which chemists and tech- 

6. Such overlapping of the boundaries between business outlays and consump- 
tive spending is vfren encouraged by jnstitutional conditions. An expenditure 
debited to the account of trading expenses reduces net profits and thereby the 
amount of taxes due. If taxes absorb 50 per cent of profits, the charitable business- 
man spends only 50 per cent of the gift out of his own pocket. The rest burdens 
the Department of Internal Revenue.

nutrition will not regard such things as negligible. 

The Scope and Method of Catallactics 

nologists deem perfectly equal, prefers the more expensive, he has a reason. 
If he does not err, he pays for services which chemistry and technology 
cannot comprehend with their specific methods of investigation. If a man 
prefers an expensive place to a cheaper one because he likes to sip his cock- 
tails in the neighborhood of a duke or of cafC society, we may remark on 
his ridiculous vanity. But we must not say that the man's conduct does not 
aim at an improvenlent of his own state of satisfaction. 

What a man does is always aimed at an improvement of his own state 
of satisfaction. In this scnse-and in no other-we are free to use the term 
selfishness and to emphasize that action is necessarily always selfish. Even 
an action directly aiming at the improvement of other people's conditions 
is selfish. The actor considers it as more satisfactory for himself to make 
other people eat than to eat himself. His uneasiness is caused by the aware- 
ness of the fact that other people are in want. 

It is a fact that many people behave in another way and prefer to fill 
their own stomach and not that of their fellow citizens. But this has noth- 
ing to do with economics; it is a datum of historical experience. At any 
rate, economics refers to every kind of action, no matter whether moti- 
vated by the urge of a man to eat or to make other people eat. 

If maximizing profits means that a man in all market transactions aims at 
increasing to the utmost the advantage derived, it is a pleonastic and peri- 
phrastic circumlocution. It only asserts what is implied in the very category 
of action. If it means anything else, it is the expression of an erroneous idea. 

Some economists believe that it is the task of economics to establish how 
in the whole of society the greatest possible satisfaction of all people or of 
the greatest number could be attained. They do not realize that there is 
no method which would allow us to measure the state of satisfaction at- 
tained by various individuals. They n~isconstruc the character of judg- 
ments which arc based on the comparison between various people's happi- 
ness. While expressing arbitrary value judgments, they believe themselves 
to be establishing facts. One may caIl it: just to rob thc rich in order to 
make presents to the poor. However, to call something fair or unfair is 
always a subjective value judgment and as such purely personal and not 
liable to any verification or falsification. Economics is not intent upon 
pronouncing value judgments. It aims at a cognition of the consequences 
of certain modes of acting. 

It has been asserted that the physiological needs of all men arc of the 
same kind and that this equality provides a standard for the measurement 
of the degree of their objective satisfaction. In expressing such opinions 
and in recommending the use of such criteria to guide the government's 
policy, one proposes to deal with men as the breeder deals with his cattle. 
But the reformers fail to reaIize that there is no universal principle of ali- 
mentation valid for all men. Which one of the various principles one 
chooses depends entirely on the aims one wants to attain. The cattle 
breeder does not feed his cows in order to make them happy, but in order 
to attain the ends which he has assigned to them in his own plans. He may 


Humm Action 

prefer more milk or more meat or something else. What type of man do 
the man breeders want to rear-athletes or mathematicians? U7arriors or 
factory hands? He who would make man the material of a purposeful 
system of breeding and feeding would arrogate to himself despotic 
powers and would use his felIow citizens as means for the attainment of 
his own ends, which differ from those they themselves are aiming at. 

The value judgments of an individual differentiatc between what makes 
him more satisfied and what less. The valuc judgments a man pronounces 
about: another man's satisfaction do not assert anything about this other 
man's satisfaction. They only assert what condition of this other man 
better satisfies the man who pronounces the judgment. The reformers 
searching for the maximum of general satisfaction have told us merely 
what state of other people's affairs would best suit themselves. 

q. The Autistic Economy 
No other imaginary construction has caused more offense than that 
of an isolated economic actor entirely dependent on himsclf. How- 
ever, economics cannot do without it. In order to study interpersonal 
exchange it must compare it with conditions under which it is absent. 
It constructs two varieties of the image of an autistic economy in 
which there is only autistic exchange: the cconomy of an isolated 
individual and the economy of a socialist society. In cmploying this 
imaginary construction the economists do not bother about the prob- 
lem of 6.hether or not such a system could really They are 
fully aware of the fact that their imaginary construction is fictitious. 
Robinson Crusoe, who, for all that, may have existed, and thc general 
manager of a perfectly isolated socialist commonwealth that never 
existed, would not have been in a position to plan and to act as people 
can only whcn taking recourse to economic calculation. However, 
in the frame of our imaginary construction wc are free to pretend 
that they could calculate whenever such a fiction may be useful for 
the discussion of the specific problem to be dealt with. 

The imaginary construction of an autistic economy is at the bottom 
of the popular distinction between productivity and profitability as it 
developed as a yardstick of value judgments. Those resorting to this 
distinction consider the autistic economy, especially that of the 
socialist type, the most desirable and most perfect system of eco-
nomic management. Every phenomenon of the market economy is 
judged with regard to whether or not it could be justified from the 

8. We are dealing here with problems of theory, not of history. We can there- 
fore abstain from refuting the objections raised against the concept of an isolated 
actor by referring to the historical role of the self-sufficient household economy. 

The Scope and Method of Catallactics 

viewpoint of a socialist system. Only to acting that would be pur- 
poseful in the plans of such a system's manager are positive value and 
the epithet prodz~ctiveattached. All other activities performed in the 
market economy are called unproductive in spite of the fact that they 
may be profitable to those who perform them. Thus, for example, 
sales promotion, advertising, and banking are considered as activities 
profitable but nonproductive. 

Economics, of course, has nothing to say about such arbitrary value 
judgments. 

5. The State of Rest and the Evenly Rotating 
The only method of dealing with the problem of action is to 
conceive that action ultimately aims at bringing about a state of 
affairs in which there is no longer any action, whether because all 
uneasiness has been removed or because any further removal of feIt 
uneasiness is out of the question. Action thus tends toward a state 
of rest, absencc of action. 

The thcory of prices accordingly analyzes interpersona1 exchange 
from this aspect. People keep on exchanging on the market until no 
further exchange is ~ossible because no party expects any further im- 
provement of its own conditions from a new act of exchange. The 
potential buyers consider the prices asked by the potential sellers 
unsatisfactory, and vice versa. No more transactions take place. A 
state of rest emerges. This state of rest, which we may call the plain 
state of rest, is not merely an imaginary construction. It comes to 
pass again and again. When the stock market closes, the brokers have 
carried out a11 orders which could be executed at the market price. 
Only those potential sellers and buycrs who consider the market 
price too low or too high respectively have not sold or bo~ght.~ 

The 

same is vaIid with regard to all transactions. The whole market econ- 

omy is a big exchange or markct place, as it werc. At any instant 

all those transactions take place which the parties are ready to enter 

into at the realizable price. New sales can only be effected whcn the 

vahations of thc parties have changed. 

It has been asserted that the notion of the plain state of rest is 

unsatisfactory. It refers, people have, said, only to the determination 

of prices of goods of which a definite supply is already available, and 

does not say anything about the effects brought about by these prices 

9. For the sake of simplicity we disregard the price fluctuations in thc course 
of the business day. 

Human Action 

upon production. The objection is unfounded. The theorems im- 
plied in the notion of the plain state of rest are valid with regard to 
all transactions without exception. It is true, the buyers of factors 
of production will immediately embark upon producing and very 
soon reenter the market in order to sell their products and to buy 
what they want for their own consumption and for continuing 
production processes. I3ut this does not invalidate the scheme. This 
scheme, to be sure, does not contend that the state of rest will last. 
'The lull will certainly disappear as soon as the momentary condi- 
tions which brought it about change. 

The notion of the plain state of rcst is not an imaginary construc- 
tion but the adequate description of what happens again and again 
on evcry marltet. In this regard it differs radically from the imaginary 
construction of the final state of rest. 

In dealing with the plain state of rest ure look only at what is 
going on right nonr. We restrict our attention to what has happened 
momentarily and disregard what will happen later, in the next in- 
stant or tomorrow or later. We are dealing only with prices really 
paid in sales, i.e., with the prices of the immediate past. We do not 
ask whether or not future prices will equal these prices. 

Bat now wc go a step further. We pay attention to factors which 
are bound to bring ahout a tendency toward price changes. We try 
to find out to what god this tendency rnust lead before all its driving 
force is exhausted and a new state of rest'emergcs. The price corre- 
sponding to this future statc of rest was called the natural price by 
older economists; nowadays the term static price is often used. In order 
to avoid misleading associations it is more expedient to call it the 
final price and accordingly to speak of the \ha1 state of rest. This 
final state of rest is an imaginary construction, not a description of 
reality. For the final state of rcst will never be attained. New dis- 
turbing factors will emerge before it will be realized. What makes 
it necessary to take recourse to this imaginary construction is the 
fact that the marlret at every instant is moving toward a final state 
of rest. Every later new instant can create new facts altering this 
final state of iest. But the market is always disquieted by a striving 
after a definite final statc of rest. 

The market price is a real phenomenon; it is the exchange ratio 
which was actual in business transactecf. The final price is a hypothet- 
ical price. The market prices are historical facts and we are there- 
fore in a position to note them with numcricaI exactitude in dollars 
and cents. The final price can only be defined by defining the condi- 
tions required for its emergence. No definite numerical value in 


The Scope and A4ethod of Catallactics 

monetary terms or in quantities of other goods can be attributed to 
it. It wiil nevcr appear on the market. The market price can never 
coincide with the final price coordinated to the instant in which this 
market structure is actual. But catallactics would faiI lamentably in 
its task of analyzing the problems of price determination if it were to 
neglect dealing with the final price. For in the market situation from 
which the market price emerges there are already latent forces oper- 
ating which will go on bringing about price changes until, provided 
no new data appear, the final price and the final state of rest are 
established. We wouId unduly restrict our study of price determina- 
tion if we were to loolr only upon the momentary market prices and 
the plain state of rest and to disregard the fact that the market is 
already agitated by factors which must result in further price changes 
and a tendency toward a different state of rest. 

The phenomenon with which we have to cope is the fact that 
changes in the factors which determine the formation of prices do 
not produce a11 their effects at once. A span of time must elapse be- 
fore all their effects are exhausted. Between the appearance of a new 
datum and the perfect adjustment of the market to it some time must 
pass. (And, of course, while this period of time elapses, other new 
data appear.) In dealing with the effects of any change in the factors 
operating on the market, we must never forget that we are dealing 
with events taking place in succession, with a series of effects suc- 
ceeding one another. We are not in a position to know in advance 
how much time will have to elapse. But we know for certain that some 
time must elapse, although this period may sometimes be so smaIl that 
it hardly plays any role in practical life. 

Economists often erred in neglecting the element of time. Take 
for instance the controvcrsy concerning the effects of changes in the 
quantity of money. Some people were only concerned with its long- 
run effects, i.e., with the final prices and the final state of rest. Others 
saw only the short-run effects, i.c., the prices of the instant follow- 
ing the change in the data. Both were mistaken and their conclusions 
were consequently vitiated. Many more cxamples of the same blunder 
could be cited. 

The imaginary construction of the final state of rest is marked by 
paying full regard to change in the temporal succession of events. In 
this respect it diffcrs from the imaginary construction of the evenly 
rotating economy which is characterized by the elimination of change 
in the data and of the time element. (It is inexpedient and misleading 
to call this imaginary construction, as is usual, the static economy or 
the static equilibrium, and it is a bad mistake to confuse it with the 


Human Action 

imaginary construction of a stationary economy.lO) The evenly 
rotating economy is a fictitious system in which thc market prices 
of all goods and services coincide with the final prices. There are 
in its frame no price changes whatever; there is perfect price stabil- 
ity. The same market transactions are repeated again and again. The 
goods of thc higher orders pass in the same quantities through the 
same stages of processing until ultimatcly the produced consumers' 
goods come into the hands of the consumers and are consumed. No 
changes in the market data occur. Today does not differ from yester- 
day and tomorrow will not differ from today. The system is in 
perpetual flux, but it remains always at the same spot. It revolves 
evenly round a fixed center, it rotates evenly. The plain state of rest 
is disarranged again and again, but it is instantly reestablished at the 
previous level. All factors, including thosc bringing about the re- 
curring disarrangement of the plain state of rest, arc comtant. There-
fore prices--commonly called static or equilibrium prices-remain 
constant too. 

The essence of this imaginary construction is the elimination of 
the lapse of time and of the perpetual change in the market phenomena. 
The notion of any change with regard to supply and demand is in- 
compatible with this construction. Only such changes as do not 
affect the configuration of the price-determining factors can be 
considered in its frame. It is not necessary to people the imaginary 
world of the evenly rotating economy with immortal, non-aging and 
nonproliferating men. We are free to assume that infants are born, 
grow old, and finally die, provided that total population figures and 
the number of people in every age group remain equal. Then the 
demand for commodities whose consumption is limited to certain 
age groups does not alter, although the individuals from whom it 
originates are not the same. 

In reality there is never such a thing as an evenly rotating eco- 
nomic system. However, in order to analyze the prol.&rns of change 
in the data and of unevenly and irregularly varying movement, wc 
must confront them with a fictitious state in which both are hypo- 
thetically eliminated. It is therefore preposterous to maintain that the 
construction of an evenly rotating economy does not elucidate condi- 
tions within a changing universe and to require the economists to 
substitute a study of "dynamics" for their alleged exclusive occupa- 
tion with "statics." This so-called static method is precisely the proper 
mental tool for the examination of change. There is no means of 
studying the complex phenomena of action other than first to ab- 

10. See below, pp. 251-252. 

The Scope and Method of Catallactics 2 49 

stract from change altogether, then to introduce an isolated factor 
provoking chzngc, and ultimately to analyze its effects under the 
assun~ption that other things remain equal. It is furthermore absurd 
to believe that the services rendered by the construction of an evenly 
rotating economy are the more valuable the more the object of our 
studies, the real~i of real action, corresponds to this construction in 
respect to absence of change. The static method, the employment of 
the imaginary construction of an evenly rotating economy, is the 
only adequate method of analyzing the changes concerned without 
regard to w-hether they are great or small, sudden or slow. 

The objections hitherto raised against the use of the imaginary con- 
struction of an evenly rotating economy missed the mark entirely. 
Their authors did not grasp in what respect this construction is prob- 
lematic and why it can easily engender error and confusion. 

Action is change, and change is in the temporal sequence. But in 
the evenly rotating economy change and succession of events are 
climinated. Action is to make choices and to cope with an uncertain 
futurc. But in the evenly rotating economy there is no choosing and 
the future is not uncertain as it docs not differ from the present known 
state. Such a rigid system is not peopled with living men malting 
choices and liable to error; it is a world of soulless unthinking autom- 
atons; it is not a human society, it is an ant hill. 

These itlsoIuble contradictions, however, do not affect the service 
which this imaginary construction renders for the only problem for 
whose treatment it is both appropriate and indispensable: the problem 
of the relation between the prices of products and those of the 
factors required for their production, and the implied problems of 
entrepreneurship and of profit and loss. In order to grasp the func- 
tion of entrepreneurship and the meaning of profit and loss, wc con-
struct a system from which they are absent. This image is merely a 
tool for our thinking. It is not the description of a possible and realiz- 
able state of affairs. It is even out of the question to carry the im- 
aginary construction of an evenly rotating system to its ultimate 
logical consequences. For it is impossible to eliminate the entre- 
preneur from the picture of a rnarket economy. The various comple- 
mentary factors of production cannot come together spontaneously. 
They need to be combined by the purposive efforts of men aiming 
at certain ends and motivated'by the urge to improve their state of 
satisfaction. In eliminating the entrepreneur one eliminates the driving 
force of the whole market system. 

Then there is a second deficiency. In the imaginarv construction of 

an evenly rotating economy, indirect exchange and the use of money 


z jo Human Action 

are tacitly implied. But what kind of money can that be? In a system 
without change in which there is no uncertainty whatever about the 
future, nobody needs to hold cash. Every individual knows precisely 
what amount of money he will need at any future date. He is there- 
fore in a position to lend all the funds he receives in such a way that 
the loans fall due on the date he will need them. Let us assume that 
there is only gold money and only one central bank. With the 
successive progress toward the state of an evenly rotating economy 
all individuals and firms restrict step by step their holding of cash 
and the quantities of gold thus released flow into nonmonetary-in- 
dustrial-employment. When the equilibrium of the evenly rotating 
economy is finally rcached, there are no more cash holdings; no more 
gold is used for monetary purposes. The individuals and firms own 
claims against the central bank, the maturity of each part of which 
precisely corresponds to the amount they will need on the respective 
dates for the settlement of thcir obligations. The central bank does 
not need any reserves as the total sum of the daily payments of its 
customers exactly equals the total sum of withdrawals. All trans- 
actions can in fact be effected through transfer in the bank's books 
without any recourse to cash. Thus the "money" of this system is 
not a medium of exchange; it is not money at all; it is mereiy a nu-
me'rai~e,an ethercal and undetermined unit of accounting of that 
vague and indefinable character which the fancy of some economists 
and the errors of many laymen mistakenly have attributcd to money. 
The interposition of these numerical expressions between seller and 
buyer does not affect the essence of the saIes; it is neutral with re- 
ga;d to the people's economic activities. But the notion of a neutral 
money is unrealizable and inconceivable in itself.'* If we were to use 
the inexpedient terminology employed in many contemporary eco- 
nomic writings, we would have to say: Money is necessarily a 
"dynami~ factor"; there is no room left for money in a "static" sys- 
tem. But the very notion of a market economy without money is self-
contradictory. 

The imaginary construction of an evenly rotating system is a 
limiting notion. In its frame there is in fact no longer any action. 
Automatic reaction is substituted for the conscious striving of think- 
ing man after the removal of uneasiness. We can employ this problem- 
atic imaginary construction only if we never forget what purposes it 
is designed to serve. We want first of all to analyze the tendency, pre- 
vailing in every action, toward the establishment of an evenly rotating 
economy; in doing so, we must always take into account that this 

I r. Cf. below, pp. 413-416. 


The Scope and Method of CataElactics 251 

tendency can never attain its goal in a universe not perfectly rigid 
and immutable, that is, in a universe which is living and not dead. 
Secondly we need to comprehend in what respects the conditions of a 
living world in which there is action differ from those of a rigid world. 
This we can discover only by the argumenturn a contrario provided 
by the image of a rigid economy. Thus we are led to the insight that 
dealing with the uncertain conditions of the unltnown future-that 
is, speculation-is inherent in every action, and that profit and loss 
are necessary features of acting which cannot be conjured away by 
any wishful thinking. The procedures adopted by those economists 
who are fully aware of these fundamental cognitions may be called 
the logical method of economics as contrasted with the technique of 
the mathema~ical method. 

The mathematical economists disregard dealing with the actions 
which, under the imaginary and unrealizable assumption that no fur- 
ther new data will emerge, are supposed to bring about the evenly 
rotating economy. They do not notice the individual speculator who 
aims not at the establishment of the evenly rotating economy hut at 
profiting from an action which adjusts the conduct of affairs better 
to the attainment of the ends sought by acting, the best possible re- 
moval of uneasiness. They stress excl~;sivel~ the imaginary state of 
equilibrium which the whole complex of all such actions would attain 
in the absence of any further change in the data. They describe this 
imaginary equilibrium by sets of simultaneous differential equations. 
They fail to recognize that the state of affairs they are dealing with is 
a state in which there is no longer any action but only a succession of 
events provoked by a mystical prime mover. They devote all their 
efforts to describing, in mathematical symbols, various "equilibria," 
that is, states of rest and the absence of action. They deal with equili- 
brium as if it were a real entity and not a limiting notion, a mere 
mental tool. What they are doing is vain playing with mathematical 
symbols, a pastime not suited to convey any 1tnowledge.l2 

6. The Stationary Economy 
The imaginary construction of a stationary economy has some- 
times been confused with that of an evenly rotating economy. Rut in 
fact these two constructions differ. 

The stationary economy is an economy in which the weaIth and 
income of the individuals remain unchanged. With this image 

12. For a further critical examination of mathematical economics see below, 
pp-347-354-

2 j2 Human Action 

changes are compatible which would be incompatible with the con- 
struction of the evenly rotating economy. Population figures may 
rise or drop provided that they are accompanied by a corresponding 
rise or drop in the sum of wealth and income. The demand for some 
commodities may change; but these changes must occur so slowly 
that the transfer of capital from those branches of production which 
are to be restricted in accordance with them into those to be ex- 
panded can be effected by not replacing equipment used up in the 
shrinking branches and instead investing in the expanding ones. 

The imaginary construction of a stationary economy leads to two 
further imaginary constructions: the progressing (expanding) econ- 
omy and the retrogressing (shrinking) economy. In the former the 
per capita quota of wealth and income of the individuals and the pop- 
ulation figure tend toward a higher numerical value, in thc latter 
toward a lower numerical value. 

In thc stationary economy the total sum of all profits and of all 
losses is zero. In the progressing economy the total amount of profits 
exceeds the total amount of losses. In the retrogressing economy the 
total amount of profits is smaller than the total amount of losses. 

The precariousness of these three imaginary constructions is to be 
seen in the fact that they inlply the possibility of the measurement 
of wealth and income. As such measurements cannot be made and are 
not even conceivable, it is out of the question to apply them for a 
rigorous classification of the conditions of reality. Whenever eco- 
nomic history ventures to classify economic evolution within a cer- 
tain period according to the scheme stationary, progressing, or retro- 
gressing, it resorts in fact to historical understanding and does not 
"mea~ure.~' 

7. The Integration of Catallactic Functions 
When men in dealing with the problems of their own actions, and 
when economic hisrory, descriprive economics, and econu~ilicstatistics 
in reporting other people's actions, employ the terms entrepreneur, 
capitalist, landowner, worker, and consumer, they speak of ideal 
types. When economics employs the same terms it speaks of cataI- 
lactic categories. The entrepreneurs, capitalists, landowners, workers, 
and consumers of economic theory are not living men as one meets 
them in the reality of life and history. They are the embodiment of 
distinct functions in the market operations. The fact that both act- 
ing men and historical sciences apply in their reasoning the results of 
economics and that they construct their ideal types on the basis of 


The Scope and Metbod of Catallactics 

and with reference to the categories of praxeological theory, does 
not modify the radical logical distinction between ideal type and 
economic category. The economic categories we are concerned with 
refer to purely integrated functions, the ideal types refer to historical 
events. Living and acting man by necessity combines various func- 
tions. He is never merely a consumer. He is in addition either an 
entrepreneur, landowner, capitalist, or worker, or a person supported 
by the intake earned by such people. Moreover, the functions of the 
entrepreneur, the landowner, the capitalist, and the worker are very 
often combined by the same persons. History is intent upon classify- 
ing men according to the ends they aim at and the means they em- 
ploy for the attainment of these ends. Economics, exploring the 
structure of acting in the market society without any regard to the 
ends people aim at and the means they employ, is intent upon dis- 
cerning categories and functions. These are two different tasks. The 
difference can best be demonstrated in discussing the catallactic con- 
cept of the entrepreneur. 

In the imaginary construction of the evenIy rotating economy there 
is no room left for entrepreneurial activity, because this construction 
eliminates any change of data that could affect prices. As soon as one 
abandons this assumption of rigidity of data, one finds that action 
must needs be affected by every change in the data. As action neces- 
sarily is directed toward influencing a future state of affairs, even if 
sometimes only the immediate future of the next instant, it is affected 
by evcry incorrectly anticipated change in the data occurring in the 
period of time between its beginning and the end of the period for 
which it aimed to provide (period of provision 13). Thus the outcome 
of action is always uncertain. Action is always speculation. This is 
valid not only with regard to a market economy but no less for 
Robinson Crusoe, the imaginary isolated actor, and for the condi- 
tions of a socialist economy. In the imaginary construction of an 
evenly rotating system nobody is an entrepreneur and speculator. In 
any reai and iiving economy every actor is aiways an entrepreneur 
and speculator; the people taken care of by the actors-the minor 
family members in the market society and the masses of a socialist 
society--are, although themselves not actors and therefore not spec- 
ulators, affected by the outcome of the actors' speculations. 

Economics, in speaking of entrepreneurs, has in view not men, but 

a definite function. This function is not the particular feature of a 

special group or class of men; it is inherent in every action and bur- 

dens every actor. In embodying this function in an imaginary figure, 

13. Cf. below, p. 478. 

Human Action 

we resort to a methodological makeshift. The term entrepreneur as 
uscd by catallactic theory means: acting man exclusively seen from 
the aspect of the uncertainty inherent in every action. In using this 
term one must ncver forget that every action is embedded in the 
flux of time and therefore involves a speculation. The capitalists, the 
landowners, and the laborers are by necessity speculators. So is the 
consumer in providing for anticipated future needs. There's many 
a slip 'twixt CUP and lip. 

Let us try to think thc imaginary construction of a pure entrepre- 
neur to its ultimate logical consequences. This entrepreneur does not 
own any capital. The capital required for his entrepreneurial activities 
is lent to him by the capitalists in the form of moncy loans. The law, it 
is true, considers him the proprietor of the various means of pro- 
duction purchased by expending the sums borrowed. LTevertheless 
he remains propertyless for the amount of his assets is balanced by his 
liabilities. If he succeeds, the net profit is his. If he fails, the loss must 
fall upon thc capitalists who haw lent him the funds. Such an entrc- 
preneur u odd, in fact, be an cmployee of the capitalists who specu- 
lates on their account and takes a loo per cent share in the net 
profits without being concerned about the losses. But even if the 
entrepreneur is in a position to provide himself a part of the capital 
required and borrows only the rest, things are essentially not dif- 
ferent. To the extent that the Iosses incurred cannot be borne out of 
rhe entrepreneur's own funds, they fall upon the lending capitalists, 
whatever the terms of the contract may be. A capitalist is always also 
virtually an entrepreneur and speculator. Ne always runs the chance 
of losing his funds. Thcre is no such thing as a pcrfectly safe invest- 
ment. 

The self-sufficient landowner who tills his estate only to supply his 
own household is affected by all changes influencing the fertility of 
his farm or the object of his needs. Within a market economy the 
result of a farmer's activities is affected by all changes regarding the 
importance of his piece of iand for suppiying the market. The farmer 
is clearly, even from the point of view of mundane terminology, an 
entrepreneur. So proprietor of any means of production, whether 
they are represented in tangible goods or in money, remains un-
touched by the unccrtainty of the future. The employment of any 
tangible goods or money for production, i.e., the provision for later 
days, is in itself an entreprcncurial activity. 

Things arc essentially the same for the laborer. He is born the 
proprietor of certain abilities; his innate faculties are a means of 
production which is better fitted for some kinds of work, less fitted 


The Scope and Method of Catallactics 

for others, and not at all fitted for still others.14 If he has acquired the 
skill needed for the performance of certain kinds of labor, he is, 
with regard to the timc and the material outlays absorbed by this 
training, in the position of an investor. He has made an input in the 
expectation of being compensated by an adequate output. The laborer 
is an entrepreneur in so far as his wages are determined by the price 
the rnarket allows for the kind of work he can perform. This price 
varies according to the change in conditions in the same way in which 
the price of every other factor of production varies. 

In the context of economic theory the meaning of the terms con- 
cerned is this: Entrepreneur means acting man in regard to the 
changes occurring in the data of the market. Capitalist and landowner 
mean acting man in regard to the changes in vaIue and price which, 
even with all the market data remaining equal, are brought about 
by the mere passing of time as a consequence of the different valua- 
tion of present goods and of future goods. Worker means man in re- 
gard to the employment of the factor of production human labor. 
Thus every function is nicely integrated: the entrepreneur earns 
profit or suffers loss; the owners of means of production (capita1 
goods or land) earn originary interest; the workers earn wages. In 
this sense we elaborate the imaginary construction of functiond dist~i-
bution as different from the actual historical distribution.16 

Economics, howcver, always did and still does use the term "entre- 
preneur" in a sense other than that attached to it in the imaginary con- 
struction of functional distribution. It also calls entrepreneurs those 
who are especially eager to profit from adjusting production to the 
expected changes in conditions, those who have more initiative, more 
venturesomeness, and a quicker eye than the crowd, the pushing and 
promoting pioneers of economic improvement. This notion is nar- 

14. In what sense labor is to be seen as a nonspecific factor of production see 
above, pp. 133-135. 
15. Let us emphasize again that everybody, laymen included, in dealing with 
the problems of income determination always takes recourse to this Imaginzry 
construction. The economists did not invent it; they only purged it of the de- 
ficiencies peculiar to the popular notion. For an epistemological treatment of 
functional distribution cf. John Bates Clark, The Distribution of Wealth (New 
York, 1908). p. 5, and Eugen von Bohm-Rawerk, Geravzmelte Schriften, ed. 
F.X. Weiss (Vienna, 1924)~p. 299. The tcrm "distribution" must not deceive any- 
body; its empIoyment in this context is to be cxplairled by the role played in the 
history of economic thought by the imaginary construction of a socialist state (cf. 
above, p. 240). There is in the operation of a market economy nothing which 
could properly be called distribution. Goods are not first produced and then 
distributed, as would be the case in a socialist state. The word "distribution" as 
applied in the term "functional distribution" complies with the meaning attached 
to "distribution" 150 years ago. In present-day English usage "distribution" 
signifies dispersal of goods among consumers as effected by commerce. 

Human Action 

rower than the concept of an entrepreneur as used in the construc- 
tion of functional distribution; it does not include many instances 
which the latter includes. It is awkward that the same term should 
be uscd to signify two different notions. It would have been more 
expedient to employ another term for this second notion-for in-
stance, the term "promoter." 

It is to be admitted that the notion of the entrepreneur-promoter 
cannot be defined with praxeological rigor. (In this it is like the notion 
of money which also defies-different from the notion of a medium 
of exchange-a rigid praxeological defiuition.l6) However, economics 
cannot do without the promoter concept. For it refers to a datum 
that is a general characteristic of human nature, that is present in all 
market transactions and marks them profoundly. This is the fact that 
various individuals do not react to a change in conditions with the 
same quickness and in the same way. The inequality of men, which is 
due to differences both in their inborn qualities and in the vicissitudes 
of their lives, manifests itself in this way too. There are in the market 
pacemakers and others who only imitate the procedures of their more 
agile fellow citizens. The phenomenon of leadership is no less real on 
the market than in any other branch of human activities. The driving 
force of the market, the element tending toward unceasing innovation 
and improvement, is provided by the restlessness of the promoter and 
his eagerness to make profits as large as possible. 

There is, however, no danger that the equivocal use of this term 
may result in any ambiguity in the exposition of the catallactic sys- 
tem. Wherever any doubts are likely to appear, they can be dis- 
pelled by the employment of the term promoter insiead of entre-
preneur. 

The Entrepreneurial Function in the Stationary Economy 

The futures market can relieve an entrepreneur of a part of his entre- 
preneurial function. As far as an entrepreneur has "insured" himself 
through suitabie forward transactions against iosses he may possibiy suffer, 
he ceases to be an entrepreneur and the entrepreneurial function devolves 
on the other party to the contract. The cotton spinner who when buying 
raw cotton for his mill sells the same quantity forward has abandoned a 
part of his entrepreneurial function. He will neither profit nor lose from 
changes in the cotton price occurring in the period concerned. Of course, 
he does not entirely cease to serve in the entrepreneurial function. Those 
changes in the price of yarn in general or in the price of the special counts

price of raw cotton affect him nonetheless. Even if he spins only as

a contractor for a remuneration agreed upon, he is still in an entrepreneurial 
function with regard to the funds invested in his outfit. 

We may construct the image of an economy in which the conditions 
required for the establishment of futures markets are realized for all kinds 
of goods and services. In such an imaginary construction the entrepreneur- 
ial function is fulIy separated from all other functions. There emerges a 
class of pure entrepreneurs. The prices determined on the futures markets 
direct the whole apparatus of production. The dealers in futures alone 
make profits and suffer losses. All other people are insured, as it were, 
against the possible adverse effects of the uncertainty of the future. They 
enjoy security in this regard. The heads of the various business units are 
employees, as it were, with a fixed income. 

If we further assume that this economy is a stationary economy and that 
all futures transactions are concentrated in one corporation, it is obvious 
that the total amount of losses precisely equals the total amount of profits. 
We need only to nationalize this corporation in order to bring about a 
socialist state without profits and losses, a state of undisturbed security 
and stability. But this is so only because our definition of a stationary 
economy implies equality of the total sum of losses and that of profits. In 
a changing economy an excess either of profits or of losses must emerge. 

It would be a waste of time to dwell longer upon such oversophisticated 
images which do not further the analysis of economic problems. The only 
reason for mentioning them is that they reflect ideas which are at the 
bottom of some criticisms made against the economic system of capitalism 
and of some delusive plans suggested for a socialist control of business. 
Now, it is true that a socialist scheme is logically compatible with the un- 
realizable imaginary constructions of an evenly rotating economy and of 
a stationary economy. The predilection with which mathematical 
economists almost exclusively deal with the conditions of these imaginary 
constructions and with the state of "equilibrium" implied in them, has made 
people oblivious of the fact that these are unreal, self-contradictory and 
imaginary expedients of thought and nothing else. They are certainly not 
suitable models for the construction of a living society of acting men. 


XV. THE MARKET 
T 
T 
I. The Cllaracteristics of the Market Econon~y 
HE market economy is the social system of the division of labor 
under private ownership of the means of production. Every- 
body acts on his own behalf; but everybody's actions aim at the 
satisfaction of other people's needs as well as at the satisfaction of his 
own. Everybody in acting serves his fellow citizens. Everybody, on 
the other hand, is served by his fellow citizens. Everybody is both a 
means and an end in himself; an ultimate end for himself and a means 
to other people in their endeavors to attain their own ends. 
This system is steered by the market. The market directs the individ- 
ual's activities into thosc channels in which he best serves the wants 
of his fellow men. There is in the operation of the marltet no com- 
pulsion and coercion. The state, the social apparatus of coercion and 
con~pulsion, does not interfere with the market and with the citizens' 
activities directed by the market. It employs its power to beat people 
into submission solely for the prevention of actions destructive to 
the preservation arid the smooth operation of the market economy. 
It protects the individual's Life, health, and property against violent 
or fraudulent aggression on the part of domestic gangsters and ex- 
ternal foes. Thus the state creates and preserves the environment in 
which the market economy can safely operate. The A4arxian slogan 
"anarchic production'' pertinently characterizes this social structure 
as an economic system which is not directed by a dictator, a produc- 
tion tsar who assigns to each a task and compels hini to obey this 
coiiiiii,aiid. Eacli maii is fi.ee; iiobody is s"bjeci to a &spot 0: his 
own accord the individual integrates himself into the cooperative 
system. The market directs him and reveals to him in what way he 
can best promote his own welfare as well as that of other people.-~he 
market is supreme. The market alone puts the whole social system 
in order and provides it with sense and meaning. 
The market is not a place, a thing, or a collective entity. The market 
is a process, actuated by the interplay of the actions of the various 
individuals cooperating undcr the di&ion of labor. The forces de- 
termining the-continually changing-state of the market are the 


The Market 2.59 

value judgments of these individuals and their actions as directed by 
these value judgments. The state of the market at any instant is the 
price structure, i.e., the totality of the exchange ratios as established 
by the interaction of those eager to buy and those eager to sell. There 
is nothing inhuman or mystical with regard to the market. The mar- 
ket process is entirely a resultant of human actions. Every market 
phenomenon can be traced back to definite choices of the members 
of the market society. 

The market process is the adjustment of the individual actions of 
the various members of the tnarket society to the requirements of 
mutual cooperation. The market prices tell the producers what to 
produce, how to produce, and in what quantity. The market is the 
focal point to which the activities of the individuals converge. It ic 
the center from which the activities of the individuals radiate. 

The market economy must be strictly differentiated from the 
second thinkable-although not realizable-system of social cooper- 
ation under the division of labor: the system of social or governmentaI 
ownership of thc means of production. This second system is com- 
monly called socialism, communism, planned economy, or state 
capitalism. The market economy or capitalism, as it is usually called, 
and the socialist economy preclude one another. There is no mixture 
of the two systems possil~le or thinkable; there is no such thing as a 
mixed economy, a system that would be in part capitalistic and 
in part socialist. Production is directed either by the market or by the 
decrees of a production tsar or a committee of production tsars. 

If within a society based on private ownership of the means of 
production some of these means are publicly owned and operated- 
that is, owned and operated by the government or one of its agencies 
-this does not make for a mixed system which would combine 
socialism and capitalism. The fact that the state or municipalities 
own and operate some plants does not alter the characteristic features 
of the market economy. These publicIy owned and operated enter- 
prises are subject to the sovereignty of the market. They must fit 
themselves, as buyers of raw materials, equipment, and labor, and as 
sellers of goods and services, into the scheme of the market economy. 
They are subject to the laws of the market and thereby depend on 
the consumers who .may or may not patronize them. They must 
strive for profits or, at least, to avoid losses. The government may 
cover losses of its plants or shops by drawing on public funds. But 
this neither eliminates nor mitigates the supremacy of the market; it 
merely shifts it to another sector. For the means for covering the 
losses~rnust be raised by the imposition of taxes. But this taxation has 


a60 Human Action 

its effects on the market and influences the economic structure ac- 
cording to the laws of the market. It is the operation of the market, 
and not the government collecting the taxes, that decides upon whom 
the incidence of the taxes falls and how they affect production and 
consumption. Thus the market, not a government bureau, determines 
the working of these publicly operated enterprises. 

Kothing that is in any way connected with the operation of a 
n~arltct is in the praxeological or economic sense to be called socialism. 
The notion of socialism as conceived and defined by a11 socialists 
implies the absence of a market for factors of production and of 
prices of such factors. The "socialization" of individ~zal plants, shops, 
and farms-that is, their transfer from private into public ownership 
-is a method of bringing about socialism by successive measures. 
It is a step on the way toward socialism, but not in itself socialism. 
(Marx and the orthodox Marxians flatly deny the possibility of such 
a gradual approach to socialism. According to their doctrine the 
evolution of capitalism will one day reach a point in which at one 
stroke capitalism is transformed into socialism.) 

Government-operated enterprises and the Russian Soviet economy 
are, by the mere fact that they buy and sell on markets, connected 
with the capitalist sj stem. They themselves bear witness to this con- 
nection by calculating in terms of money. They thus utilize the in- 
tellectual methods of the capitalist system that they fanatically con- 
demn. 

For monetary economic calculation is the intellectual basis of the 
market economy. The tasks set to acting within any system of the 
division of labor cannot be achieved without economic calculation. 
The market economy calculates in terms of money prices. That it is 
capable of such calculation w-as instrumental in its evolution and condi- 
tions its present-day operation. The market economy is real because 
it can calculatc. 

2. Capital 
The mental tool of the market economy is economic calculation. 
The fundamental notion of economic calculation is the notion of 
cnpital and its correlative income. 

The notions of capital and income as applied in accountancv and in 
the mundane reflections of which accountancy is merely a refine-
ment, contrast the means and the ends. The calculating 14ind of the 
actor draws a boundary line between the consumers' goods which he 
plans to employ for the immediate satisfaction of his wants and the 


The Market 261 

goods of all orders-including those of the first order '-which he 
plans to employ for providing, by further acting, for the satisfaction 
of future wants. The differentiation of means and ends thus becomes 
a differentiation of acquisition and consumption, of business and 
househoId, of trading funds and of household goods. The whole 
complex of goods destined for acquisition is evaluated in money terms, 
and this sum-the capital-is the starting point of economic calcula- 
tion. The immediate end of acquisitive action is to increase or, at 
least, to preserve the capital. That amount which can be consumed 
within a definite period without lowering the capital is called income. 
If consumption exceeds the incomc available, the difference is called 
capital consumption. If the income available is greater than the 
amount consumed, the difference is called saving. Among the main 
tasks of economic calculation are those of establishing the magnitudes 
of income, saving, and capital consumption. 

The reflections which led acting man to the notions implied in the 
concepts of capital and income are latent in every premeditation 
and planning of action. Even the most primitive husbandmen are 
dimly aware of the consequences of acts which to a modern account- 
ant would appear as capital consumption. The hunter's reluctance to 
kill a pregnant hind and the uneasiness felt even by the most ruthless 
warriors in cutting fruit trees were manifestations of a mentality 
which was influenced by such considerations. These considerations 
were prcsent in the age-old legal institution of usufruct and in 
analogous customs and practices. Rut only people who are in a 
position to resort to monetary calculation can evolve to full clarity 
the distinction between an economic substance and the advantages 
derived from it, and can apply it neatly to all classes, kinds, and orders 
of goods and services. They alone can establish such distinctions 
with regard to the perpetually changing conditions of highly devel- 
oped processing industries and the complicated structure of the social 
cooperation of hundreds of thousands of specialized jobs and per- 
f ormances. 

Looking backward*from the cognition provided by modern ac- 
countancy to the conditions of the savage ancestors of the human 
race, wc may say metaphorically that they too used "capital." A 
contemporary accountant could apply all the methods of his pro- 
fession to their primitive tools of hunting and fishing, to their cattle 
breeding and their tilling of the soil, if he knew what prices to assign 
to the various items concerned. Some economists concluded there- 

I. For this man these goods are not goods of the first order, but goods of a 
higher order, factors of further production. 

Human Action 

from that "capital" is a category of all human production, that it is 
present in every thinkable system of the conduct of production 
processes-i.e., no less in Robinson Crusoe's involuntary hermitage 
than in a socialist society-and that it does not depend upon the 
practice of monetary cal~ulation.~ This is, however, a confusion. 
The concept of capital cannot be separated from the context of mone- 
tary calculation and from the social structure of a market economy 
in which alone monetary calculation is possible. It is a concept which 
makes no sense outside the conditions of a market economy. It plays 
a role exclusively in the plans and records of individuals acting on 
their own account in such a system of private ownership of the 
means of production, and it developed with the spread of economic 
calculation in monetary terrn~.~ 

Modern accountancy is the fruit of a long historicaI evolution. To- 
day there is, among businessmen and accountants, unanimity with 
regard to the meaning of capital. Capital is the sum of the money 
equivalent of all assets minus the sum of the money equivalent of all 
liabilities as dedicated at a definite date to the conduct of the opera- 
tions of a definite business unit. It does not matter in what these assets 
may consist, whether they are pieces of land, buildings, equipment, 
tools, goods of any kind and order, claims, receivables, cash, or what- 
ever. 

It is a historical fact that in the early days of accountancy the 
tradesmen, the pacemakers on the way toward monetary calculation, 
did not for the most part include the money equivalent of their 
lmildjngs and land in the notion of capital. It is another historical fact 
that agriculturists were slow in applying the capital concept to their 
land. Even today in the most advanced countries only a part of the 
farmers are familiar with the practice of sound accountancy. Many 
farmers acquiesce in a system of bookkeeping that neglects to pay 
heed to the land and its contribution to production. Their book entries 
do not include the money equivalent of the land and are consequently 
indiiierenr to changes in this equivaient. Such accounts are defeerive 
because they fail to convey that information which is the sole aim 
sought by capital accountink. They do not indicate whether or not the 
operation of the farm has brought about a detcrioration in the land's 
capacity to contribute to production, that is, in its objective use 
value. If an erosion of the soil has taken place, their books ignore it, 
and thus the calcdated income (net yield) is grcater than a more 
complete method of bookkeeping would have shown.

The Market 263 

It is necessary to mention these historical facts because they in- 
fluenced the cndcavors of the economists to construct the notion of 
real cnpital. 

The economists were and are still today confronted with the super- 
stitious belief that the scarcity of factors of production could be 
brushed away, either entirely 'or at least to some extent, by increas- 
ing the amount of money in circulation and by credit expansion. In 
order to deal adequately with this fundamental problem of economic 
policy they considered it necessary to construct a notion of real 
capital and to oppose it to the notion of capital as applied by the 
businessman whose calculation refers to the whole complex of his 
acquisitive activities. At the time the economists embarltcd upon thesc 
endeavors the place of the money cqnivalem of land in the concept 
of capital was still questioned. Thus the economists thought it rea- 
sonable to disregard land in constructing their notion of real capital. 
They defined real capital as the totality of the produced factors of 
production availabIe. Hairsplitting discussions were started as to 
whether inventories of consumers' goods held by business units are 
or are not real capital. But thcrc was almost unanimity that cash is 
not real czpital. 

RTow this concept of a totality of the produced factors of pro- 
duction is an empty concept. The money equivalent of the various 
factors of production owned by a business unit can be determined and 
summed up. But if we abstract from such an evaluation in money 
terms, the totality of the produced factors of production is merely 
an enumeration of physical quantities of thousands and thousands of 
various goods. Such an inventory is of no use to acting. It is a descrip- 
tion of a part of the universe in terms of technology and topography 
and has no reference whatever to the problems raised by the en- 
deavors to improve human well-being. We may acquiesce in the 
terminologica1 usage of calling the produced factors of production 
capital goods. But this does not render the concept of real capital any 
more meaningful. 

The worst outgrowth of the use of the mythical notion of real 
capital was that economists began to speculate about a spurious prob- 
lem called the productivity of (real) capital. A factor of production 
is by definition a thing that is able to contribute to the success of a 
process of production. Its market price reflects entirely the value that 
people attach to this contribution. The services expected from the 
employment of a factor of production (i.e., its contribution to pro- 
ductivity) are in market transactions paid according to the full value 
people attach to them. These factors are considered valuabIe only 


Human Action 

on account of these services. These services are the onIy reason why 
prices are paid for them. Once these prices are paid, nothing remains 
that can bring about further payments on the part of anybody as 
a compensation for additional productive services of these factors of 
production. It was a blunder to explain interest as an income derived 
from the productivity of capital." 

No less detrimenta1 was a second confusion derived from the real 
capital concept. People began to meditate upon a concept of social 
capital as different from private capital.Starting from the imaginarv 
construction of a socialist economy, they were intent upon defining a 
capital concept suitable to the economic activitics of the general man-
ager of such a system. They were right in assuming that this manager 
would be eager to know whether his conduct of affairs was success- 
ful (viz., from the point of view of his own valuations and the ends 
aimed at in accordance with these valuations) and how much he could 
expend for his wards' consumption without diminishing the available 
stock of factors of production and thus impairing the yield of fur- 
ther production. A socialist government would badly need the con- 
cepts of capital and income as a guide for its operations. However, in 
an economic system in which there is no private ownership of the 
means of production, no market, and no prices for such goods, the 
concepts of capital and income are mere academic postulates devoid 
of any practical application. In a socialist economy there are capital 
goods, but no capital. 

The notion of capital makes sense only in the market economy. It 
serves the deliberations and calculations of individuals or groups of 
individuals operating on their own account in such an economy. It is 
a device of capitalists, entrepreneurs, and farmers eager to make profits 
and to avoid losses. It is not a category of all acting. It is a category 
of acting within a market economy. 

3. Capitalism 
All civilizations have up to now been based on private ownership 
of the means of production. Tn the past civilization and private prop- 
erty have been linked together. Those who maintain that economics 
is an experimental science and nevertheless recommend public control 
of the means of production, lamentably contradict themselves. If 
historical experience could teach us anything, it would be that private 
property is inextricably linked with civilization. There is no ex-

The Market 

perience to the effect that socialism could provide a standard of living 
as high as that provided by capitalism." 

The system of market economy has never been fully and purely 
tried. But there prevailed in the orbit of Western civilization since 
the Middle Ages by and large a general tendency toward the abolition 
of institutions hindering the operation of the market economy. With 
the successive progress of this tendency, population figures multiplied 
and the masses' standard of living was raised to an unprecedented and 
hitherto undreamed of level. The average American worker enjoys 
amenities for which Croesus, Crams, the Medici, and Louis XIV 
would have envied him. 

'The problems raised by the socialist and interventionist critique 
of the market economy are purely economic and can be dealt with 
only in the way in which this book tries to deal with them: by a 
thorough analysis of human action and all thinkable systems of social 
cooperation. The psychological problem of why people scorn and 
disparage capitalism and call everything they dislike "capitalistic" 
and everything they praise "socialistic" concerns history and must 
be left to the historians. But there are several other issues which 
we must stress at this point. 

The advocates of totalitarianism consider "capitalism" a ghastly 
evil, an awful illness that came upon mankind. In the eyes of Marx 
it was an inevitable stage of mankind's evolution, but for all that the 
worst of evils; fortunately salvation is imminent and will free man 
forever from this disaster. In the opinion of other people it would 
have been possible to avoid capitalism if only men had been more 
moral or more skillful in the choice of economic policies. All such 
lucubrations have one feature in common. They look upon capitalism 
as if it were an accidental phenomenon which could be eliminated 
without altering conditions that are essential in civilized man's acting 
and thinking. As they neglect to bother about the problem of eco- 
nomic calculation, they are not aware of the consequences which the 
abolition of the monetary calculus is bound to bring about. They do 
not realize that socialist men for whom arithmetic will be of no use 
in planning action, will differ entirely in their mentality and in their 
mode of thinking from our contemporaries. In dealing with socialism, 
we must not overlook this mental transformation, even if we were 
ready to pass over in silence the disastrous consequences which wouId 
result for man's material well-being.

(Irvington-on-Hudson, 1947), pp. 80-87. 

266 Human Action 

The market economy is a man-made mode of acting under the 
division of labor. But this does not imply that it is something acci- 
dental or artificial and could be replaced by another mode. The mar- 
ket economy is the product of a long evolutionary process. It is the 
outcome of man's endeavors to adjust his action in the best possible 
way to the given conditions of his'environment that he cannot alter. 
It is the strategy, as it were, by the application of which man has 
triumphantly progressed from savagery to civilization. 

This mode of argumentation is very popular among present-day 
authors: Capitalism was thc economic system which brought about 
the marvelous achievements of the last two hundred years; there- 
fore it is done for because what was beneficial in the past cannot be 
so for our time and for the future. Such reasoning is in open con- 
tradiction to the principlcs of experimental cognition. There is no 
need at this point to raise again the question of whether or not the 
science of human action can adopt the methods of the experimental 
natural sciences. Even if it wcre permissible to answer this question in 
the affirmative, it would be absurd to argue as these d rebours experi-
~nentalists do. Experimental science argues that because a was valid 
in the past, it will be valid in the future too. It must never argue the 
othcr way round and assert that because a was valid in the past, it is 
not valid in the future. 

It is customary to blame the economists for an alleged disregard of 
history. The economists, it is contended, consider the market econ- 
omy as the ideal and eternal pattcrn of social cooperation. They con- 
centrate their studies upon investigating the conditions of thk mar- 
ket economy and neglect cvcrything else. They do not bother about 
the fact that capitalism emerged only in the last two hundred years 
and that even today it is restricted to a comparatively small area of 
the earth's surface and to a minority of peoples. There were and are 
other civilizations with a different mentality and different modes of

---r-------L 'r';"""

aeternitatis, a passing phenomenon, an ephemeral stage of historical 
evolution, just the transition from precapitalistic ages to a postcapital- 
istic future. 

A11 these criticisms are spurious. Economics is, of course, not a 
branch of history or of any other historicaI science. It is the theory 
of all human action, the general science of the immutable categories 
of action and of their operation under all thinkable special conditions 
under which man acts. It provides as such the indispensabIe mental 
tool for dealing with historical and ethnographic problems. A his-
torian or an ethnographer who neglects in his work to take full ad- 


The Market 267 

vantage of the resuIts of economics is doing a poor job. In fact he does 
not approach the subject matter of his research unaffected by what 
he disregards as theory. He is at every step of his gathering of allegedly 
unadulterated facts, in arranging these facts, and in his conclusions 
derived from them, guided by confused and garbled remnants of 
perfunctory economic doctrines constructed by botchers in the cen- 
turies preceding the elaboration of an economic science and long 
since entirely exploded. 

The analysis of the problems of the market society, the only pat- 
tern of human action in which calculation can be applied in planning 
action, opens access to the analysis of all thinkable modes of action 
and of all economic problems with which historians and ethnog- 
raphers are confronted. All noncapitalistic methods of economic 
management can be studied only under the hypothetical assumption 
that in them too cardinal numbers can be used in recording past action 
and planning future action. This is why economists place the study of 
the pure market economy in the center of their investigations. 

It is not the economists who lack the "historical sense" and ignore 
the factor of evolution, but their critics. The economists have always 
been fully aware of the fact that the market economy is the product 
of a long historical process which began when the human race 
emerged from the ranks of the other primates. The champions of 
what is mistakenly called "historicism" are intent upon undoing the 
effects of evolutionary changes. In their eyes everything the existence 
of which they cannot trace back to a remote past or cannot discover 
in the customs of some primitive Polynesian tribes is artificial, even 
decadent. They consider the fact that an institution was unknown to 
savages as a proof of its uselessness and rottenness. Marx and Engels 
and the Prussian professors of the E-Iistorical School exulted when 
they learned that private property is "only" a historical phenomenon. 
For them this was the proof that their socialist plans were reali~able.~ 

The creative genius is at variance with his fellow citizens. As the 

pioneer of things new and unheard of he is in conflict with their 

uncritical acceptance of traditional standards and values. In his eyes 

the routine of the regular citizen, the average or common man, is 

6. The most amazing roduct of this widespread method of thought is the 
book of a Prussian pro fessor, Bernhard Laum (Diegeschlossene Wirtschaft 
[Tiibingen, 19331). Laum assembles a vast collection of quotations from ethno- 
graphical writings showing that many primitive tribes considered economic 
autarky as natural, necessary, and motally good. He concludes from this that 
autarky is the natural and most expedient state of economic management and 
that the return to autarky which he advocates is "a biologically necessary process" 
(p. 491).

simply stupidity. For him "bourgeois" is a synonym of imbecility.? 
The frustrated artists who take delight in aping the genius's mannerism 
in order to forget and to conceal their own impotence adopt this 
terminology. These Bohemians call everything they dislike "bour- 
geois." Since Marx has made the term "capitalist" equivalent to 
"bourgeois," they use both words synonymously. In the vocabularies 
of all languages the words "capitalistic" and "bourgeois" signify to- 
day all that is shameful, degrading, and infamou~.~ Contrariwise, 
people call all that they deem good and praiseworthy "socialist." The 
regular scheme of arguing is this: A man arbitrarily calls anything he 

dislikes "capitalistic," and then deduces from this appellation that the 
thing is bad. 

This semantic confusion goes still further. Sisrnondi, the romantic 
eulogists of the Middle Ages, all socialist authors, the Prussian His- 
torical School, and the American Institutionalists taught that capitalism 
is an unfair system of exploitation sacrificing the vital interests of the 
majority of people for the sole benefit of a small group of profiteers. 
No decent man can advocate this "mad" system. The economists who 
contend that capitalism is beneficial not only to a small group but to 
everyone are "sycophants of the bourgeoisie." They arc either too 
dull to recognize the truth or bribed apologists of the selfish class in- 
terests of the exploiters. 

Capitalism, in the terminology of these foes of liberty, democracy, 
and the market economy, means the economic policy advocated by 
big business and millionaires. Confronted with the fact that some- 
but certainly not all-wealthy entrepreneurs and capitalists nowadays 
favor measures restricting free trade and competition and resulting in 
monopoly, they say: Contemporary capitalism stands for protection- 

7. Guy de Maupassant analyzed Flaubert's alleged hatred of the bourgeois in 
Etude srrr Gustave Flaubert (rcprinted in Oeuvres complhtes de Gustawe Flaw 
bert [Paris, 18851, Vol. VII). Flaubert, says Maupassant, "aimait le monde" (p. 
67); that is, he liked to move in the circle of Paris society composed of aristo-
crats, wealthy bourgcois, and the Clitc of artists, writers, philosophers, scientists, 
statesmen, and cntrepreneurs (promoters). He used the term bourgeois as 
synonymous with imbecility and defined it this way: "I call a bourgeois whoever 
has mean thoughts (pense bassement)." Hence it is obvious that in employing 
the term bourgeois Flaubert did not have in mind the bo~r~~eoisie
as a social class, 
but a kind of imbecility he most frequently found in this class. He was full of 
contempt for the common man (Ye born peuple") as well. However, as he had 
more frequent contacts with the "gens du monde" than with workers, the stupid- 
ity of the former annoyed him more than that of the latter (p. 59). These 
observations of Maupassant held good not only for Flaubert, but for the "anti- 
bourgeois" sentiments of all artists. Incidentally, it must be emphasized that from 
a Marxian point of view Flaubert is a "bourgeois" writer and his novels arc an 
"ideological superstructure" of the "capitalist or bourgeois mode of production."

ism, cartels, and the abolition of competition. It is true, they add, that at 
a definite period of the past British capitalism favored free trade both 
on the domestic market and in international relations. This was be- 
cause at that time the class interests of the British bourgeoisie were 
best served by such a policy. Conditions, however, changed and to- 
day capitalism, i.e., the policy advocated by the exploiters, aims at 
another policy. 

It has already been pointed out that this doctrine badly distorts 
both economic theory and historical facts? There were and there 
will always be people whose selfish ambitions demand protection for 
vested interests and who hope to derive advantage from measures 
restricting competition. Entrepreneurs grown old and tired and the 
decadent heirs of people who succeeded in the past dislike the agile 
parvenus who challenge their wealth and their eminent social position. 
Whether or not their desire to make economic conditions rigid and 
to hinder improvements can bc realized, depends on the climate of 
public opinion. The ideological structure of the nineteenth century 
as fashioned by the prestige of the teachings of the liberal economists 
rendered such wishes vain. When the technological improvements 
of the age of liberalism rcvolutionized the traditional methods of 
production, transportation, and marketing, those whose vested in- 
terests were hurt did not ask for protection because it would have been 
a hopeless venture. Rut today it is deemed a Iegitimate task of govern- 
ment to prevent an efficient man from cotnpeting with the less effi- 
cient. Public opinion sympathizes with the demands of powerful 
pressure groups to stop progress. The butter producers are with con- 
siderable success fighting against margarine and the musicians against 
recorded music. The labor unions are deadly foes of every new 
machine. It is not amazing that in such an environment less efficient 
businessmen aim at protection against more efficient competitors. 

It would be correct to describe this state of affairs in this way: To- 
day many or some groups of business are no longer liberal; they do 
not advocate a pure market economy and free enterprise, but, on 
the contrary, are asking for various measures of government inter- 
ference with business. But it is entirely misleading to say that the 
meaning of the concept of capitalism has changed and that "mature 
capitalismv-as the Americans call it--or "late capitalism7'-as the 
Marxians call it-is characterized by restrictive policies to protect 
the vested interests of wage earners, farmers, shopkeepers, artisans, 
and sometimes also of capitalists and entrepreneurs. The concept of 
capitalism is as an economic concept immutable; if it means anything, 

9. Cf. above, pp. 81-84. 

2 70 Human Action 

it means market economy. One deprives oneself of the semantic tools 
to deal adequately with the problems of contemporary history and 
economic policies if one acquiesces in a different terminology. This 
faulty nomenclature becomes understandable only if we realkc that 
the pseudo-economists and the politicians who apply it want to pre- 
vent people from knowing what the market economy really is. They 
want to make people believe that all the repulsive manifestations of 
restrictive government policies are produced by "capitalism." 

4. The Sovereignty of the Consumers 
The direction of all economic affairs is in the market society a 
task of the entrepreneurs. Theirs is the control of production. They 
are at the helm and stcer the ship. A superficial observer would be- 
lieve that they are supreme. But they are not. They are bound to 
obey unconditionally the captain's orders. The captain is the con- 
sumer. Ncither the entrcpreneurs nor the farmers nor the capjtaljsts 
determine what has to be produced. The consurncrs do that. If a busi- 
nessman does not strictly obey the orders of the public as they are 
conveyed to him by the structure of market prices, he suffers losses, 
he goes bankrupt, and is thus removed from his eminent position at 
the helm. Other men who did better in satisfying the demand of the 
consumers replace him. 

The consumers patronize those shops in which they can buy what 
they want at the cheapest price. Their buying and their abstention 
from buying decides who should own and run the plants and the land. 
They make poor pcople rich and rich people poor. They determine 
precisely what should be produced, in what quality, and in what 
quantities. They are merciless egoistic bosses, full-of whims and 
fancies, changeable and unpredictable. For them nothing counts other 
than their own satisfaction. They do not care a whit for past merit 
and vested interests. If something is offered to them that they like 
better or that is cheaper, they desert their old purveyors. In their 
capacity as buyers and consumers they are hard-hearted and callous, 
without consideration for other people. 

Only the sellers of goods and services of the first order are in direct 
contact with the consumers and directly depend on their orders. But 
they transmit the orders received from the public to all those pro- 
ducing goods and services of the higher orders. For the manufacturers 
of consumers' goods, the retailers, the service trades, and the profes- 
sions are forced to acquire what they need for the conduct of their 
own business from those purveyors who offer them at the cheapest 


The Market 

price. If they were not intent upon buying in the cheapest market 
and arranging their processing of the factors of production so as to 
fill the dcmands of the consumers in the best and chcapest way, they 
wonld be forced to go out of business. Morc efficient men who 
succeeded better in buying and processing the factors of production 
would supplant thcm. 'The consumer is in a position to give free rein 
to his caprices arid fancies. The entrcpreneurs, capitalists, and farmers 
have thcir hands tied; they are bound to comply in their operations 
with the orders of the brlying public. Evcn- deviation from the lincs 
prescribed by the demand of the consunkrs debits thcir account. 
The slightest deviation,whether willfully brought about or caused by 
error, bad judgment, or inefficiency. restricts thcir profits or makes 
then1 disappear. A lnorc scrious deviation results in losses and thus 
impairs or cntirely absorbs their wcalth. Capitalisrs, entrepreneurs, 
and landowners can only prescrve and increase thcir wealth by filling 
best thc orders of thc consumers. They arc not free LO spend money 
which the consumers arc riot prepared to refund to them in paying 
more for thc products. In thc condrict of thcir busincss affairs they 
mnust be unfeeling and stony-hearted beca~lsc the consumers, their 
l)osses, arc themselves unfeeling and stony-hearted. 

Thc consumers dctermine ultimately not only thc priccs of thc con- 
sumers' goods, but no lcss the prices of a11 factors of production. They 
determine thc income of cvery membcr of the market economy. The 
consumers, not thc cntreprcneurs, pay ultimatcIy the wages earned 
by every worker, the glamorous movic star as well as the charwoman. 
With every penny spent the consumers determine thc direction of 
all production processes and the minutest details of the organization 
of all busincss activities. This state of affairs has been described by 
calling the marltct a democracy in which cvery penny gives a right 
to cast a ballot.'0 It would be more correct to say that a dcmacratic 
constitution is 3 schenlc to assign to the citizens in the conduct of 
government the same suprcrnacy the market cconomy givcs them in 
their capacity as consnmcrs. However, thc comparison is imperfcct. 
In the political democracy only thc votcs cast for the majority candi- 
date or the majority plan are effective in shaping the course of affairs. 
The votes polled 1)). the minoritv do not directly influcncc policics. 
But on the market no votc is cas; in vain. Every penny spent has the 
power to M-ork upon the production processcs. The publishers cater 
not only to the majority by publishing detective stories, but aIso to 
the minority reading lyrical poetry and philosophical tracts. The

Human Action 

bakeries bake bread not only for healthy people, but also for the 
sick on special diets. The decision of a consumer is carried into effect 
with the full momentum he gives it through his readiness to spend a 
dcfinite amount of money. 

It is true, in the market the various consumers have not the same 
voting right. The rich cast more votes than the poorer citizens. But 
this inequality is itself the outcome of a previous voting process. To 
be rich, in a pure market economy, is the outcome of success in filling 
best the demands of the consumers. A wealthy man can preserve his 
wealth only by continuing to serve the consumers in the most efficient 
way. 

Thus the owners of the material factors of production and the 
entrepreneurs are virtually mandataries or trustees of the consumers, 
revocably appointed by an election daily repeated. 

There is in the operation of a market economy only one instance in 
which the proprietary class is nor completely subject to the suprem- 
acy of the consumers. hlonopoly prices are an infringement of the 
sway of the consumers. 

The Metaphorical Employment of the Terminology 
of Political Rule 

The orders given by businessmen in the conduct of their affairs can be 
heard and seen. hTobody can fail to become aware of them. Even messenger 
boys know that the boss runs things around the shop. But it requires a 
little more brains to notice the entrepreneur's dependence on the market. 
The orders given by the consumers are not tangible, thy cannot be per- 
ceived by the senses. Many people lack the discernment to take cognizance 
of them. They fa11 victim to the deIusion that entrepreneurs and capitalists 
are irresponsible autocrats whom nobody calls to account for their 
actions.ll 

The outgrowth of this mentality is the practice of applying to business 
the terminology of political rule and military action. Successful business- 
men are called kings or dukes, their enterprises an empire, a kingdom, or a 
dukedom. If this idiom were only a harmless metaphor, there would be no 
need to criticize it. But it is the source of serious errors which play a sinis- 
ter role in contemporary doctrines. 

Government is an apparatus of compulsion and coercion. It has the 
power to obtain obedience by force. The political sovereign, be it an auto- 
crat or the people as represented by its mandataries, has power to crush 
rebellions as Iong as his ideological might subsists. 

The position which entrepreneurs and capitalists occupy in the market 

II. Beatrice Webb, Lady Passfield, herself the daughter of a wealthy business- 
man, may be quoted as an outstanding example of this mentality. Cf. My Ap-
prenticeship (New York, 1926)~p. 42. 

The Market 

economy is of a different character. A "chocolate king" has no power over 
the consumers, his patrons. He provides them with chocolate of the best 
possible quality and at the cheapest price. He does not rule the consumers, 
he serves them. The consumers are not tied to him. They are free to stop 
patronizing his shops. He loses his "kingdom" if the consumers prefer to 
spend their pennies elsewhere. Nor does he "rule" his workers. He hires 
their services by paying them precisely that amount which the consumers 
are ready to restore to him in buying the product. Still less do thc capital- 
ists and entrepreneurs exercise political control. The civilized nations of 
Europe and America were long controlled by governn~ents which did not 
considerably hinder the operation of the market economy. Today many of 
these countries too arc dominated by parties which are hostile to capitalism 
and believe that every harm inflicted upon capitalists and entrepreneurs is 
extremely beneficial to the people. 

In an unhampered market economy the capitalists and cntrepreneurs 
cannot expect an advantage from bribing officeholdcrs and politicians. On 
the other hand, the officeholders and politicians are not in a position to 
blackmail businessmen and to eFtort graft from them. In an interventionist 
country powerful pressure groups are intent upon securing for their mern- 
bers privileges at the expense of weaker groups and individuals. Then the 
businessmen may deem it expedient to protect themselves against dis- 
criminatory acts on the part of the executive officers and the legislature by 
bribery; once used to such methods, they may even try to employ them 
in order to secure privileges for themselves. At any rate the fact that busi- 
nessmen corrupt politicians and officeholders and are blackmailed by such 
people does not indicate that they are supreme and rule the countries. It is 
those ruled-and not the rulers-who bribe and are paying tribute. 

The majority of businessmen are prevented from resorting to bribery 
either by their moral convictions or by fear. They venture to preserve the 
free entcrprise system and to defend themselves against discrimination by 
Iegitimate dcnlocratic methods. They form trade associations and try to 
influence public opinion. The results of these endeavors have been rather 
poor, as is evidenced by the triumphant advance of anticapitalist policies. 
The best that they have been able to achieve is to delay for a while somc 
especially obnoxious measures. 

Demagogues misrepresent this state of affairs in the crassest way. They 
tell us that these associations of bankers and manufacturers are the true 
rulers of their countries and that the whole apparatus of what they call 
'cplut~democraZic" government is dominated by them. A simple enumera- 
tion of the laws passed in the last decades by any country's legislature is 
enough to explode such legends. 

j. Competition 
In nature there prevail irreconcilable conflicts of interests. The 
means of subsistence are scarce. Proliferation tends to outrun sub- 


Human Action 

sistence. Only the fittest plants and animals survive. The antagonism 
between an animal starving to death and another that snatches the 
food a\vay from it is implacable. 

Social cooperation under the division of labor removes such antag- 
onisms. It substitutes partnership and mutuality for hostility. The 
members of society are united in a common venture. 

The term competition as applied to the conditions of animal life 
signifies the rivalry between animals which manifests itself in their 
search for food. We may call this phenomenon biological competi- 
tion. Biological competition must not be confused with social com- 
petition, i.e., the striving of individuals to attain the most favorable 
position in the systcm of social cooperation. As there will always be 
positions which men value more highly than others, people will strive 
for them and try to outdo rivals. Social competition is consequently 
present in every conceivable mode of social organization. If u7ewant 
to think of a state of affairs in which there is no social competition, 
w-e must construct the image of a socialist system in which the chief 
in his endeavors to assign to everybody his place and task in society 
is not aided by any ambition on the part of his subjects. The individ- 
uals are entirely indifferent and do not apply for special appointments. 
They behave like the stud horses which do not try to put themselves 
in a favorable light when the owner picks out the stallion to im- 
pregnate his best brood mare. But such people would no longer be 
acting men. 

In a totalitarian system social competition manifests itself in the 
endeavors of people to court the favor of those in power. In the 
market economy competition manifests itself in the facts that the 
sellers must outdo one another by offering better or cheaper goods 
and services and that the buyers must outdo one another by offering 
higher prices. In dealing with this variety of social competition which 
may be called cntallactic competition, we must guard ourselves against 
various popular fallacies. 

The classical economists favored the abolition of all trade barriers 
preventing people from competing on the market. Such restrictive 
laws, they explained, result in shifting production from those places 
in which natural conditions of production are more favorable to 
places in which they are less favorable. They protect the less efficient 
man against his more efficient rival. They tend to perpetuate back- 
ward technological methods of production. In short thcy curtail 
production and thus lower the standard of living. In order to make 
a11 people more prosperous, the economists argued, competition 
should be free to everybody. In this sense they used the term free 


The Ma~ket 

com9etition. There was nothing metaphysical in their employment 
of the term free. They advocated the nullification of privileges barring 
people from access to certain trades and markets. All the sophisticated 
lucubrations caviling at the metaphysical connotations of the adjec- 
tive free as applied to con~petition are spurious; they have no reference 
whatcver to the catallactic problem of competition. 

As far as natural conditions come into play, competition can only 
be "free" with regard to those factors of production which are not 
scarce and thcrefore not objects of human action. In the catallactic 
field competition is always restricted by the inexorable scarcity of 
the economic goods and services. Even in the absence of institutional 
barriers erected to restrict the number of those competing, the state 
of affairs is never such as to enable everyone to compete in all sectors 
of the markct. In each sector only comparatively small groups can 
engage in competition. 

Carallactic competition, one of the characteristic features of the 
market economy, is a social phenomenon. It is not a right, guaranteed 
by the state and the laws, that would makc it possible for every in- 
dividual to choose ad libitum the place in the structure of the division 
of labor he likes best. To assign to everybody his proper place in 
society is the task of the consumers. Their buying and abstention 
from buying is instrumental in determining each individual's social 
position. Their supremacy is not impaired by any priviIeges granted 
to the individuals qua producers. Entrance into a definite branch 
of industry is virtually free to newcomers only as far as the con- 
sumers approve of this branch's expansion or as far as the newcomers 
succeed in supplanting those already occupied in it by filling better 
or more cheaply the demands of the consumers. Additional invest- 
ment is reasonable only to the extent that it fills the most urgent among 
the not yet satisfied needs of thc consumers. If the existing plants are 
sufficient, it would be wasteful to invest more capital in the same 
industry. The structure of market prices pushes the new investors 
into other branches. 

It is necessary to emphasize this point because the failure to grasp 
it is at the root of many popular complaints about the impossibility 
of competition. Some fifty years ago people used to declare: You 
cannot compete with thc railroad companies; it is impossible to chal- 
lenge their position by starting competing lines; in the field of 
land transportation therc is no longer competition. The truth was 
that at that time the already operating lines were by and large suf- 
ficient. For additional capital investment the prospects were more 
favorable in improving the serviceableness of the already operating 


Human Action 

lines and in other branches of business than in the construction of 
new railroads. However, this did not interfere with further techno- 
logical progress in transportation technique. The bigness and the 
economic "power" of the railroad companies did not impede the 
emergence of the motor car and the airplane. 

Today people assert the same with regard to various branches of 
big business: You cannot challenge their position, they are too big 
and too powerful. But competition does not mean that anybody can 
prosper by simply imitating what other people do. It means tge op- 
portunity to serve the consumers in a better or cheaper way without 
being restrained by privileges granted to those whose vested inter- 
ests the innovation hurts. What a newcomer who wants to defy the 
vested interests of the old established firms needs most is brains and 
ideas. If his project is fit to fill the most urgent of the unsatisfied needs 
of the consumers or to purvey them at a cheaper price than their old 
purveyors, he will succeed in spite of the much tallied of bigness and 
power of the old firms. 

Catallactic competition must not be confused with prize fights and 
beauty contests. The purpose of such fights and contests is to discover 
~vho is the best boxer or the prettiest girl. The social function of 
catallactic competition is, to be sure, not to establish who is the 
smartest boy and to reward the winner by a title and medals. Its 
function is to safeguard the best satisfaction of the consumers which 
they can attain under the given state of the economic data. 

Equality of opportunity is a factor neither in prize fights and beauty 
contests nor in any other field of competition, whether biological or 
social. The immense majority of people are by the physiological 
structure of rheir bodies deprived of a chance to attain the honors 
of a boxing charnpion or a beauty queen. Only very few people can 
compete on the labor market as opera singers and movie stars. The 
most favorablc opportunity to compete in the field of scientific 
achievement is provided to the university professors. Yet, thousands 
and c'nousands of professo~spass away withoiii leavifig afiy trace 
in the history of ideas and scientific progress, w-hile many of the 
handicapped outsiders win glory through marvelous contributions. 

It is usual to find fault with the fact that catallactic competition is not 
open to everybody in the same way. The start is much more difficult 
for a poor boy than for the son of a wealthy man. But the consumers 
are not concerned about the problem of whether or not the men who 
shall serve them start their careers under equal conditions. Their only 
interest is to secure the best possible satisfaction of their needs. If the 
system of hereditary property is more efficient in this regard, they 


The Market 277 

prefer it to other less efficient systems. They look at the matter from 

the point of view of social expediency and socia1 welfare, not from 

the point of view of an alleged, imaginary, and unrealizable "natural" 

right of every individual to compete with equal opportunity. The 

realization of such a right would require placing at a disadvantage 

those born with better intelligence and greater will power than the 

average man. It is obvious that this would be absurd. 

The term competition is mainly employed as the antithesis of 

monopoly. In this mode of speech the term monopoly is applied in 

different meanings which must be clearly separated. 

The first connotation of monopoly, very frequently implied in the 
popular use of the term, signifies a state of affairs in which the 
monopolist, whether an individual or a group of individuals, exclu- 
sively controls one of the vital conditions of human survival. Such a 
monopolist has the power to starve to death all those who do not 
obey his orders. He dictates and the others have no alternative but 
either to surrender or to die. With regard to such a monopoly there 
is no market or any other kind of catallactic competition. The mo- 
nopolist is the master and the rest are slaves entirely dependent on 
his good graces. There is no need to dwell upon this kind of monopoIy. 
It has no reference whatever to a market economy. It is enough to 
cite one instance. A world-embracing socialist state would exercise 
such an absolute and total monopoly; it would have the power to 
crush its opponents by starving them to death.12 

The second connotation of nlonopoly differs from the first in 
that it describes a state of affairs compatible with the conditions of 
a market economy. A monopolist in this sense is an individual or a 
group of individuals, fully combining for joint action, who has thc 
exclusive control of the supply of a definite commodity. If we define 
the term monopoly in this way, the domain of monopoly appears 
very vast. The products of the processing industries are more or less 
different from one another. Each factory turns out products different 
from those of the other plants. Each hoiel has a monopoly on the sale 
of its services on the site of its premises. The professional services 
rendered by a physician or a lawyer are never perfectly equal to 
those rendered by any other physician or lawyer. Except for certain 
raw materials, foodstuffs, and other stapIe goods, monopoly is every- 
where on the market. 

However, the mere phenomenon of nlonopoly is without any 
significance and relevance for the operation of the market and the 

12. Cf. Trotsky (1937) as quoted by Hayek, The Rpad to Serfdom (London, 
1944)p. 89.

Human Action 

determination of prices It does not give the monopolist any advan- 
tage in selling his products. Under copyright Iaw every rhymester 
enjoys a monopoly in the salc of his poetry. But this does not influence 
the market. It may happen that no price whatever can be realized for 
his stuff and that his books can only be sold at their waste paper value. 

Monopoly in this second connotation of thc term becomes a factor 
in the determination of prices only if the demand curve for the 
monopoly good concerned is shaped in a particular way. If conditions 
are such that the monopolist can secure higher net proceeds by selling 
a smaller quantity of his product at a higher price than by selling a 
greater quantity of his supply at a lower price, there emerges a 
monopoly price higher than the potential market price would have 
been in the absence of monopoly. Monopoly prices are an important 
market phenomenon, while monopoly as such is only important if it 
can result in the formation of monopoly prices. 

It is customary to calI prices which are not monopoly prices com- 
petitive prices. While it is questionable whether or not this terminol- 
ogy is expedient, it is generalIy acceptedmd it would he difficnlt to 
change it. But onc must guard oneself against its misinterpretation. It 
would be a serious bIunder to deduce from the antithesis between 
monopoly price and competitive price that the monopoly price is the 
outgrowth of the absence of competition. There is always catallactic 
competition on the market. Catallactic competition is no less a factor 
in the determination of monopoly prices than it is in the dctcrmination 
of competitive prices. The shapc of the demand curve that makes 
the appearance of monopoly prices possible and directs the monopo- 
lists' conduct is determined by the competition of a11 other commodi- 
ties competing for the buyers' dollars. The higher the monopolist 
fixes the price at which he is ready to sell, the more potential buyers 
turn their dollars toward other vendible goods. On the market every 
commodity competes with all other commodities. 

There are people who maintain that the catallactic theory of prices 

is of no use for the study of reality because there has never been "frce" 

competition or because, at least today, there is no longer any such 

thing. All these doctrines are wrong.13 They misconstrue the phe- 

nomena and simply do not know what competition really is. It is a 

fact that the history of the last decades is a record of policies aiming 

at the restriction of competition. It is the manifest intention of these 

schemes to grant privileges to certain groups of producers by pro- 

r 3. For a refutation of the fashionable doctrines of imperfect and of monop- 
olistic competition cf. I?. A. Hayelr, Individualism and Economic Order (Chicago, 
1948), pp. 92-118. 


The Market 2 79 

tecting them against the competition of more efficient competitors. 
In many instances these policies have brought about the conditions 
required for the emergence of monopoly priccs. In many other in- 
stances this was not the case and the result was only a state of affairs 
preventing many capitalists, entrepreneurs, farmers, and workers 
from entering those branches of industry in which they would have 
rendered the most valuable services to their fellow citizens. Catallactic 
competition has been seriously restricted, but the market economy is 
still in operation although sabotaged by government and labor union 
interference. The system of catallactic competition is still function- 
ing although the productivity of labor has been seriously reduced. 

It is the ultimate end of these anticompetition policies to substitute 
for capitalism a socialist system of planning in which there is no 
catallactic competition at all. While shedding crocodile tears about 
the decline of competition, the planners want to abolish this "mad" 
competitive system. They have attained their goal in some countries. 
But in the rest of the world they have only restricted competition in 
some branches of business by increasing the number of people com- 
peting in other branches. 

The forces aiming at a restriction of cornpctition play a great role 
in our day. It is an important task of the history of our age to deal 
with them. Economic theory has no need to refer to them in particu- 
lar. The fact that there are trade barriers, privileges, cartels, govern- 
ment monopolies and labor unions is merely a datum of economic 
history. It does not rcquire special theorems for its interpretation. 

6. Freedom 
The words freedom and liberty signified for the most eminent 
representatives of mankind one of the most precious and desirable 
goods. Today it is fashionable to sneer at them. They are, trumpets 
the modern sage, "slipper$' notions and "bourgeois" prejudices. 

Freedom and liberty are not to be found in nature. In nature there 
is no phenomenon to which these terms could be meaningfully ap- 
plied. Whatever man does, he can never free himself from the re- 
straints which nature imposes upon him. If he wants to succeed in 
acting, he must submit unconditionally to the laws of nature. 

Freedom and liberty always refer to interhuman relations. A man 
is free as far as he can live and get on without being at the mercy 
of arbitrary decisions on the part of other people. In the frame of 
society everybody depends upon his fellow citizens. Social man can- 
not become independent without forsaking all the advantages of 


Human Action 

social cooperation. The self-sufficient individual is independent, but 
he is not free. He is at the mercy of everybody who is stronger than 
himself. The stronger fellow has the power to ldl him with impunity. 
It is therefore nonsense to rant about an alleged "natural" and "inborn" 
freedom which people are supposed to have enjoyed in the ages 
preceding the emergence of social bonds. Man was not created free; 
what freedom he may possess has been given to him by society. Only 
societal conditions can present a man with an orbit within the limits 
of which he can attain liberty. 

Liberty and freedom are the conditions of man within a con-
tractual society. Social cooperation under a system of private owner- 
ship of the means of production means that within the range of the 
market the individual is not bound to obey and to serve an overlord. 
As far as he gives and serves other people, he does so of his own accord 
in order to be rewarded and served by the receivers. IIe exchanges 
goods and services, he does not do compulsory labor and does not pay 
tribute. He is certainly not independent. He depends on the other 
members of society. But this dependence is mutual. The buyer de- 
pends on the seller and the seller on the buyer. 

The main concern of many writers of the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries was to misrepresent and to distort this obvious state of 
affairs. The worlters, they said, are at the mercy of their employers. 
Now, it is true that the employer has the right to fire the employee. 
But if he makes use of this right in order to indulge in his whims, he 
hurts his own interests. It is to his own disadvantage if he discharges 
a better man in order to hire a less efficient one. The market does 
not directIy prevent anybody from arbitrarily inflicting harm on his 
fellow citizens; it only puts a penalty upon such conduct. The shop- 
keeper is free to be r~~dc 

to his customers provided he is ready to bear 

the consequences. The consumers are free to boycott a purveyor pro- 

vided they are ready to pay the costs. What impels every man to the 

utmost eicrtion in the service of his fellow men and curbs innate 

tendencies toward arbitrariness and maiice is, in the market, not com- 

pulsion and coercion on the part of gendarmes, hangmen, and,penal 

courts; it is self-interest. The ~nember of a contractual society is free 

because he serves others only in serving himself. What restrains him 

is only the inevitable natural phenomenon of scarcity. For the rest 

he is free in the range of the market. 

There is no kind of freedom and liberty other than the kind which 

the market economy brings about. In a totalitarian hegemonic society 

the only freedom that is left to the individual, because it cannot be 

denied to him, is the freedom to commit suicide. 


The Mhket 28I 

The state, the social apparatus of coercion and compulsion, is by 
necessity a hegemonic bond. If government were in a position to 
expand its power ad libitum, it could abolish the market economy 
and substitute for it all-round totalitarian socialism. In order to pre- 
vent this, it is necessary to curb the power of government. This is the 
task of all constitutions, bills of rights, and laws. This is the meaning 
of all the struggles which men have fought for liberty. 

The detractors of libcrty arc in this sense right in calling it a "bour- 
geois" issue and in blaming the rights guaranteeing liberty for being 
negative. In the realm of state and government, lihcrty means restraint 
imposed upon the exercise of the police power. 

Liberty and freedom are terms employed for the description of 
the social conditions of the individual mcmbers of a market society in 
which the power of the indispensable hegemonic bond, the state, is 
curbed lest the operation of the market be endangered. In a totalitarian 
system there is nothing to which the attribute "free" could be attached 
hut the unlimited arbitrariness of the dictator. 

There would be no need to dwell upon this obvious fact if the 
champions of the abolition of liberty had not purposely brought about 
a semantic confusion. Thcy realized that it was hopeless for them to 
fight openly and sincerely for restraint and servitude. The notions 
liberty and freedom had such prestige that no propaganda could 
shake their popularity. Since time immemorial in the realm of West- 
ern civilization liberty has been considered as the most precious good. 
What gave to the West its eminence was precisely its concern about 
liberty, a social ideal foreign to the oriental peoples. The social 
philosophy of the Occident is essentially a philosophy of freedom. 
The main content of the history of Europe and the conlmunities 
founded by European emigrants and their descendants in other parts 
of the world was thc struggle for liberty. "R~lgged" individualism is 
the signature of our civilization. ATo open attack upon the freedom 
of the individual had any prospect of success. 

Thus the advocates of totalitarianism chose other tactics. They 

reverscd the meaning of words. Thcy call true or genuine liberty the 

condition of the individuals under a system in which they ha;e no 

right other than to obey orders. They call themseIves true liberals 

because they strive after such a social ordcr. They call democracy 

the Russian methods of dictatorial government. They call the labor 

union methods of violence and coercion "industrial democracy." 

They call freedom of the press a state of affairs in which only the 

government is free to publish books and newspapers. They define 

liberty as the opportunity to do the "right" things, and, of course, 


Human Action 

they arrogate to themselves the determination of what is right and 
what is not. In their eyes government omnipotence means full liberty. 
To free the police power from all restraints is the true meaning of 
their struggle for freedom. 

The market economy, say these self-styled liberals, grants liberty 
only to a parasitic class of exploiters, the bourgeoisie. These scoun- 
drels enjoy the freedom to enslave the masses. The wage earner is not 
free; he must toil for the sole benefit of his masters, the employers. The 
capitalists appropriate to themselves what according to the inalien- 
able rights of man should beIong to the worker. Under socialism the 
worker will enjoy freedom and human dignity because he will no 
longer have to slave for a capitalist. Socialism means the emancipation 
of the common man, means freedom for all. It means, moreover, riches 
for all. 

These doctrines have been able to triumph because they did not 
encounter effectivc rational criticism. Some economists did a brilliant 
job in unmasking their crass fallacies and contradictions. But the 
public ignores the teachings of economics. They are too heavy for 
the readers of tabloids and pulp magazines. The arguments advanced 
by average politicians and writers against socialism are either silly or 
irrelevant. It is useless to stand upon an alleged "natural" right of in- 
dividuals to own property if other people assert that the foremost 
"natural" right is that of income equality. Such disputes can never be 
settled. It is beside the point to criticize nonessential, attendant fea- 
tures of the socialist program. One does not refute socialism bv at- 
tacking the socialists' stand on religion, marriage, birth control; and 
art. Morcover, in dealing with such matters the critics of socialism 
were often in the wrong. Thus, for instance, they were so inept as to 
turn the disapproval of the Bolshevist persecution of the Russian 
Church into an approbation of this debased, adamantly intolerant 
church and its superstitious practices. 

In spite of these serious shortcomings of the defenders of economic 
freedom it was impossible to fool all the people all the time about 
the essential features of socialism. The most fanatical planners were 
forced to admit that their projects involve the abolition of many 
freedoms pcople enjoy under capitalism and "plutodemocracy." 
Pressed hard, they resorted to a new subterfuge. The freedom to be 
abolished, fhey emphasize, is merely the spurious "economic" freedom 
of the capitalists that harms the common man. Outside the "economic 
sphere" freedom will not only be fully preserved, but considerably 
expandcd. "Planning for Freedom" has lately become the most 


The Market 283 

popular slogan of the champions of totalitarian government and the 
Russification of all nations. 

The fallacy of this argument stems from the spurious distinction 
between two realms of human life and action, entirely separated from 
one another, viz., the "economic" sphere and the "noneconomic" 
sphere. With regard to this issue there is no need to add anything to 
what has been said in the preceding pnrts of this book. IIon.ever, 
there is another point to be stressed. 

Freedom, as people enjoyed it in the democratic countries of West- 
ern civilization in the years of the old liberalism's triumph, was not a 
product of constitutions, bills of rights, laws, and statutes. Those 
documents aimed only at safeguarding liberty and freedom, firmly 
established by the operation of the market economy, against en-
croachments on the part of officeholders. No and no 
civil law can guarantee and bring about freedom otheru.ise than hv 
supporting and defending the fundamental institutions of the markdt 
economy. Government means always coercion and compulsion and 
is by necessity the opposite of liberty. Government is a guarantor of 
liberty and is compatibk with liberty only if its range is adequately 
restricted to the preservation of economic freedom. Where there is 
no market economy, the best-intentioned provisions of constitutions 
and laws remain a dead letter. 

The freedom of man under capitalism is an effect of competition. 
The worker does not depend on the good graces of an employer. If 
his employer discharges him, he finds another employer.I4 The con- 
sumer is not at the mercy of the shopkeeper. He is free to patronize 
another shop if he likes. Nobody must Itiss other people's hands or 
fear their disfavor. Interpersonal relations are businesslike. The ex- 
change of goods and services is mutual; it is not a favor to sell or to 
buy, it is a transaction dictated by selfishness on either side. 

It is true that in his capacity as a producer every man depends 
either directly-e.g., the entrepreneur-or indirectly-e.g., the hire: 
worker-on the demands of the consumers. However, this dependence 
upon the supremacy of the consumers is not unljmited. If a man has 
a weighty reason for defying the sovereignty of the consumers, he 
can try it. There is in the range of the market a very substantial and 
effective right to resist oppression, Nobody is forced to go into the 
liquor industry or into a gun factory if his conscience objects. He 
may have to pay a price for his conviction; there are in this world 
no ends the attainment of which is gratuitous. But it is left to a man's 

14. See below, pp. 595-596. 

Human Action 

own decision to choose between a material advantage and the call of 
what he believes to be his duty. In the market economy the individual 
alone is the supreme arbiter in matters of his satisfaction.15 

Capitalist society has no means of compelling a man to change his 
occupation or his place or work other than to reward those complying 
with the wants of the consumers by higher pay. It is precisely this 
kind of pressure which many people consider as unbearable and hope 
to see abolished under socialism. They are too dull to realize that the 
only alternative is to convey to the authorities full power to deter- 
mine in what branch and at what place a man should work. 

In his capacity as a consumer man is no less free. He alone decides 
what is more and what is less important for him. He chooses how to 
spend his money according to his own will. 

The substitution of econon~ic planning for the market economy 
removes all freedom and leaves to the individual merely the right to 
obey. The authority directing all econon~ic matters controls all 
aspects of a man's life and activities. It is the only employer. All 
labor becomes compulsory labor because the employee must accept 
what the chief deigns to offer him. The economic tsar determines 
what and how much of each the consumer may consume. There is 
no sector of human life in which a decision is lcft to the individual's 
value judgments. The authority assigns a definite task to him, trains 
him for this job, and employs him at the place and in the manner it 
deems expedient. 

As soon as the economic freedom which the market economy grants 
to its members is removed, all political liberties and bills of rights 
become humbug. Habeas corpus and trial by jury arc a sham if, under 
the pretext of economic expediency, the authority has full power 
to relegate every citizen it dislikes to the arctic or to a desert and to 
assign him "hard labor" for life. Freedom of the press is a mere blind 

15. In the political sphere resistance to oppression racticed by the established 
government is the ultiwa ratio of those oppressed. &owever illegal and unbear- 
abie the oppression, however iofty and nohie the motives of the rebeis, and how- 
ever beneficial the consequenccs of their violent resistance, a revolution is al- 
ways an illegal act, disintegrating the established order of state and government. 
It is an essential mark of civil government that it is in its territory the only 
agency which is in a position to resort to measures of violence or to declare legiti- 
mate whatever violence is practiced by other agencies. A revolution is an act of 
warfare between the citizens, it abolishes the very foundations of legality and is 
at best restrained by the questionable international customs concerning belliger- 
ency. If victorious, it can afterwards establish a new legal order and a new govern- 
ment. But it can never enact a legal "right to resist oppression." Such an impunity 
granted to people venturing armed resistance to the armed forces of the govern- 
ment is tantamount to anarchy and incompatible with any mode of government. 
The Constituent Assembly of the first French Revolution was foolish enough to 
decree such a right; but it was not so foolish as to take its own decree seriously. 

The Market 285 

if the authority controls all printing offices and paper plants. And so 
are a11 the other rights of men. 

A men has freedom as far as he shapes his life according to his own 
plans. A man whose fate is dctermined by the plans of a superior 
authority, in which the cxclusivc power to plan is vested, is not free 
in the sensc in which this term "free" was used and understood by 
all people until the semantic revolution of our day brought about 
a confusion of tongues. 

7. Inequality of Wealth and Income 
The incquality of individuals with regard to wealth and income 
is an essential feature of the market economy. 

The fact that freedom is incompatible with equality of wcaIth and 
income has been stressed by man; authors. ~heie is no need to enter 
into an examination of the emotional arguments advanced in these 
writings. Neither is it necessary to raise the question of whether the 
rcnunciation of liberty could in itself guarantee the establishment 
of equality of wcalth and income and whether or not a society could 
subsist on the basis of such an cquality. Our task is merely to describe 
the role inequality lays in the framework of the nlarlrct society. 

In the market society direct compulsion and coercion are practiced 
only for the sake of preventing acts detrimental to social cooperation. 
For the rest individuals are not molested by the police power. The 
law-abiding citizen is free from the interference of jailers and hang- 
men. What pressure is needed to impel an individual to contribute his 
share to the cooperative effort of production is exercised by the price 
structure of the market. This pressure is indirect. It puts on each in- 
dividual's contribution a premium graduated according to thc value 
which the consumers attach to this contribution. In rewarding the 
individual's effort according to its value, it leaves to everybody the 
choice between a more or less complete utilization of his own faculties 
and abilities. This method can, of conrse, not eliminate t!w dlsadvan-
tages of inherent personal inferiority. But it provides an incentive to 
everybody to exert his faculties and abilities to the utmost. 

The only alternative to this financial pressure as cxercised by the 
market is direct pressure and compulsion as exercised by the police 
power. The authorities must be entrusted with the task of determining 
the quantity and quality of work that each individual is bound to per- 
form. As ii~dividuals are unequal with regard to their abilitics, this 
rcquires an examination of thcir personalities on the part of the 
authorities. The individual beconics an inmate of a penitentiary, as it 
were, to whom a definite task is assigned. If he fails to achieve what 


Human Action 

the authorities have ordered him to do, he is liable to punishment. 

It is important to realize in what the difference consists benveen 
direct pressure exercised for the prevention of crime and that ex- 
ercised for the extortion of a definite performance. In the former case 
all that is required from the individual is to avoid a certain mode of 
conduct, precisely determined by law. As a rule it is easy to establish 
whether or not this interdiction has been observed. In the second case 
the individual is liable to accomplish a definite task; the law forces 
him toward an indefinite action, the determination of which is left 
to the decision of the executive power. The individual is bound to 
obey whatever the administration orders him to do. Whether or not 
the command issued by the executive power was adequate to his 
forces and faculties and whether or not he has complied with it to 
the best of his abilities is extremely difficult to establish. Every citizen 
is with regard to all aspects of his personality and with regard to all 
manifestations of his conduct subject to the decisions of the authori- 
ties. In the market economy in a trial before a penal court the pros- 
ecutor is obliged to produce sufficient evidence that the defendant 
is guilty. But in matters of the performance of compulsory work it 
devolves upon the defendant to prove that the task assigned to him 
was beyond his abilities or that he has done all that can be expected 

of him. The administrators combine in their persons the offices of the 
legislator, the executor of the law, the public prosecutor, and the 
judge. The defcndants are entirely at their mercy. This is what people 
have in mind when speaking of lack of freedom. 

No system of the social division of labor can do without a method 
that makes individuals responsible for their contributions to the 
joint productive effort. If this responsibility is not brought about by 
the price structure of the market and the inequality of wealth and 
income it hegcts, it must be enforced by the methods of direct com-
pulsion as practiced by the police. 

8. Entrepreneurial Profit and Loss 
Profit, in a broader sense, is the gain derived from action; it is 
the increase in satisfaction (decrease in uneasiness) brought about; 
it is the difference between the higher vaIue attached to the result 
attained and the lower value attached to the sacrifices made for its 
attainment; it is, in other words, yield minus costs. To make profit 
is invariably the aim sought by any action. If an action fails to attain 
the ends sought, yield either does not exceed costs or lags behind 


The Market 287 

costs. In the latter case the outcome means a loss, a decrease in satis- 
faction. 

Profit and loss in this original sense are psychic phenomena and as 
such not open to measurement and a mode of expression which could 
convey to other people precise information concerning their inten- 
sity. A man can tell a fellow man that a suits him better than b; but 
he cannot communicate to another man, except in vague and indistinct 
terms, how much the satisfaction derived from a exceeds that de- 
rived from b. 

In the market economy all those things that are bought and sold 
against money are marked with money prices. In the monetary calculus 
profit appears as a surplus of money received over money expended 
and loss as a surplus of money expended over money received. Profit 
and loss can be expressed in definite amounts of money. It is possible 
to ascertain in terms of money how much an individual has profited 
or lost. However, this is not a statement about this individual's psychic 
profit or loss. It is a statement about a social phenomenon, about the 
individual's contribution to the societal effort as it is appraised by the 
other members of society. It does not tell us anything about the 
individual's increase or decrease in satisfaction or happiness. It merely 
reflects his fellow men's evaluation of his contribution to social co- 
operation. This evaluation is ultimately determined by the efforts of 
every rnembcr of society to attain the highest possible psychic profit. 
It is the resultant of the composite effect of all these people's sub- 
jective and personal value judgments as manifested in their conduct 
on the market. But it must not be confused with these value judgments 
as such. 

We cannot even think of a state of affairs in which people act with- 
out the intention of attaining psychic profit and in which their actions 
result neither in psychic profit nor in psychic loss.16 In the imaginary 
construction of an evenly rotating economy there are neither money 
profits nor money losses. But every individual derives a psychic profit 
from his actions, or else he would not act at all. The farmer feeds 
and milks his cows and sells the milk because he values the things 
he can buy against the money thus earned more highly than the costs 
expended. The absence of money profits or losses in such an evenly 
rotating system is due to the fact that, if we disregard the differences 

16. If an action neither improves nor impairs the state of satisfaction, it still 
involves a psychic loss because of the uselessness of the expended psychic effort. 
The individual concerned would have been better off if he had inertly enjoyed 
lie. 

Human Action 

brought about by the higher valuation of present goods as co111- 
pared with future goods, the sum of the prices of all complementary 
factors needed for production precisely equals the price of the 
product. 

In the changing world of reality differences between the sum of the 
prices of the complementary factors of production and the prices of 
the products emerge again and again. It is these differences that bring 
about money profits and money losses. ,4s far as such changes affect 
the sellers of labor and those of the original nature-given factors of 
production and of the capitalists as moneylenders, we will deal with 
them later. At this point we are dealing with entrepreneurial profit 
and loss. It is this problem that people have in mind when employing 
the terms profit and loss in mundane speech. 

Like every acting man, thc entrepreneur is always a speculator. He 
deals with the uncertain conditions of the future. His success or 
failure depends on the correctness of his anticipation of uncertain 
events. If he fails in his understanding of things to come, he is doomed. 
The only source from which an entrepreneur's profits stem is his 
ability to anticipate better than other people the future demand of 
the consumers. If everybody is correct in anticipating the future state 
of the market of a certain con~modity, its price and the prices of the 
complementary factors of production concerned would already today 
be adjusted to this future state. Xeither profit nor loss can emerge for 
those embarking upon this line of business. 

The specific entrepreneurial function consists in determining the 
employment of the factors of production. The entrepreneur is the 
man who dedicates them to special purposes. In doing so he is driven 
solely by the selfish interest in making profits and in acquiring wealth. 
But he cannot evade the law of the market. He can succeed only by 
hest serving the consumers. His profit depends on the approval of 
his conduct by the consumers. 

One must not confuse entrepreneurial profit and loss with other 
factors affecting the entrepreneur's proceeds. 

The entrepreneur's technological ability does not affect the spccitic 
entrepreneurial profit or loss. As far as his own technological activities 
contribute to the returns earned and increase his net income, we are 
confronted with a compensation for work rendered. It is wages paid 
to the entrepreneur for his labor. Neither does the fact that not every 
process of production succeeds technologically in bringing about the 
product expected, influence the specific entrepreneurial profit or 
loss. Such failures are either avoidable or unavoidable. In the first case 
they are due to the technoIogically inefficient conduct of affairs. Then 


the losses resulting are tu be debited to the entrepreneur's personal 
insuficicncy, i.e., either to his lack of technological ability or to his 
lack of the ability to hire adequate helpers. In the second case the 
failures arc due to the fact that the present state of tcchnolo~i~al 
knowledge prevents us from fully controlling the condltiom on 
which success depends. This deficiency nlay be caused either by in- 
complete knowledge concerning the conditions of success or by 
ignorance of neth hods for controlhng fully sonic of the Icnon 11condi-
tions. The price of the factors of production takes into account this 
unsatisfactory state of our Itnowledge and technological pou er. 'I'he 
price of arable land, for instance, takes into full account the fact that 
there are bad harvests, as it is determined by the anticipated average 
yield. The fact that the bursting of bottles reduces the output of 
champagne docs not affect entrepreneurial profit and loss. It is nlerelv 
one of the factors determining the cost of production and the pice 
of champagne.I7 

Accidents affecting the process of production, thc nleans of pro-
duction, or the products while they are still in the hands of the entre- 
preneur arc an itern in the bill of production costs. Experience, \t hich 
conveys to the businessman all other technological Ixlowledge, pro- 
vides jlim also uith inforniatiol~ about the average reduction in the 
quantity of physical output which such accidents are likely to Ilring 
about. By opening contingent reserves, 11c converts their effects into 
regular costs of production. With rcgarcl to contingencies the ex- 
pected incidence of which is too rare and too irregular ro be dealt 
with in this u ay by ~ndividual firms of normal size, concerted action 
on the part of suficiently large groups of firms takes care of the 
matter. The individual &ms cooperate under the principle of in-
surance against damage caused by fire, flood, or other similar con- 
tingencies. Then an insurance premium ib substituted for an appropria- 
tion to a contingency reserve. At any rate, the risks incurred by 
accidents do not introduce uncertainty into the conduct of the techno- 
jogicai processes.'"If an entrepreneur neglects to deal with then1 
duly, he gives proof of his technical insufficiency. 'lh losses thus 
incurred are to be debited to bad techniques applied, not to his 
entrepreneurial function.

enterprises the adequate degree of technological efficiency or v hose

tcchnological ignorance vitiates their cost calculation is effected on 
thc marlxt in the same way in which those deficient in the per- 
fornlancc of the specific entrepreneurial functions are eliminated. It 
may happen that an entrepreneur is so successful in his specific entre- 
prencurial function that he can compensate losses caused by his 
technological failurc. It may also happen that an entrepreneur can 
counterbalance losses due to failure in his entrepreneurial function 
I,y the advantages derived from his technological superiority or from 
the differential rent yielded by the higher productivity of the factors 
of production he employs. But one must not confuse the various 
functions which are combined in the conduct of a business unit. The 
technologically more efficient entrepreneur earns higher wage rates 
or quasi-wage rates than the less eficient in the same way in which 
the more efficient Lvorker earns more than the less efficient. The more 
cflicient machine and the more fertile soil produce higher physical 
returns per unit of costs expended; they yield a differential rent 
whcn compared with the less efficient machine and the less fertile 
soil. 'The higher wage rates and the higher rent are, ceteris paribus, 
the corollary of higher physical output. But the specific entrepre- 
neurial profits and losses are not produced by the quantity of physical 
output. They depend on the adjustment of output to the most ur- 
gent wants of the consumers. What produces them is the extent to 
lvhich the entrepreneur has succeeded or failed in anticipating the 
future-necessarily uncertain-state of the market. 

The entrepreneur is also jeopardized by political dangers. Govern- 
rr~ent policies, revolutions, and wars can damage or annildate his 
enterprise. Such events do not affect him alone; they affect the mar- 
ket economy as such and all individuals, although not all of them to 
the same exient. For the individual entrepreneur they are data which 
he cannot alter. If he is efficient, he will anticipate them in time. But 
it is not always possible for him to adjust his operations in such a way 
as to avoid damage. If the dangers expected concern only a part of 
the territory w-hich is accessible to his entrepreneurial activities, he 
can avoid operating in the menaced areas and can prefer countries in 
which the danger is less imminent. But if he cannot emigrate, he must 
stay where he is. If all entrepreneurs were fully convinced that the 
total victory of Bolshevism was impending, they would neverthe- 
less not abandon their entrepreneurial activities. he expectation of 
imminent expropriation will impel the capitalists to consume their 
funds. The entrepreneurs will be forced to adjust their plans to the 
market situation created by such capital consumption and the threat- 
ened nationalization of their shops and plants. But they will not stop 


The Market 291 

operating. If some entrepreneurs go out of business, others will take 
their place-newcomers or old entreprcneurs expanding the size of 
their enterprises. In the market economy there will always be entre- 
preneurs. Policies hostile to capitalism may deprive the consumers of 
the greater part of the benefits they would have reaped from un- 
hampered entrepreneurial activities. But they cannot eliminate the 
entrepreneurs as such if they do not entirely destroy the market 
economy. 

The ultimate source from which entrepreneurial profit and loss are 
derived is the uncertainty of the future constellation of demand and 
supply. 

If all entrepreneurs were to anticipate correctly the future state 
of the market, there would be neither profits nor losses. The prices 
of all the factors of production would already today be fully adjusted 
to tomorrow's prices of the products. In buying the factors of pro- 
duction the entrepreneur would have to expend (with due allowance 
for the difference between the prices of present goods and future 
goods) no less an amount than the buyers will pap him later for the 
product. An entreprcneur can make a profit only if he anticipates 
future conditions more correctly than other entreprcneurs. Then he 
buys the coniplcmcntary factors of production at prices the sum of 
which is smaller than the price at which he sells the product. 

If we want to construct the image of changing economic condi- 
tions in which there are neither profits nor losses, we must resort to 
an unrealizable assumption: perfect foresight of all future events on 
the part of all individuals. If those primitive hunters and fishermen to 
whom it is customary to ascribe the first accumulation of produced 
factors of production had known in advance a11 the future vicissitudes 
of human affairs, and if they and all their descendants until the last 
day of judgment, equipped with the same omniscience, had appraised 
all factors of production accordingly, entrepreneurial profits and 
losses would never have emerged. Entrepreneurial profits and losses 
are created through the discrepancy between the expected prices and 
the prices later really fixed on the markets. It is possible to confiscate 
profits and to transfer them from the individuals to whom they have 
accrued to other people. But ncither profits nor losses can ever dis- 
appear from a changing world not populated solely with omniscient 
people.

9. Entrcprencurial Profits and Losses in a Progressing 
Economy 
In the imaginary construction of a stationary economy the total sum 
of all entrepreneurs' profits equals the total sum of all entrepreneurs' 
losses. What one entrepreneur profits is in the total economic system 
counterbalanced by another entrepreneur's loss. The surplus which 
all the consumers together expend for the acquisition of a certain 
commodity is counterbdanced by the reduction in their expenditure 
for the acquisition of other commodities.'" 

It is different in a progressing economy. 

We call a progressing economy an economv in which the per capita 
quota of capital invested is increasing. In &ing this term we do not 
imply value judgments. We adopt neither the "materialistic" view 
that such a progression is good nor the "idealistic" view that it is bad 
or at least irrelevant from a "higher point of view." Of course, it is 
a well-linown fact that the immense majority of people consider the 
consequences of progress in this sense as the most desirable state of 
affairs and yearn for conditions which can be realized only in a pro- 
gressing economy. 

In the stationary economy the entrepreneurs, in the pursuit of their 
specific functions, cannot achieve anything other than to withdraw 
factors of production, provided that they are still con~crtible,~~ 
from one line of business in order to employ them in another line, or 
to direct the restoration of the equivalent of capital goods used up 
in the course of production processes toward the expansion of cer- 
tain branches of industry at the expense of other branches. In the 
progressing economy the range of entrepreneurial activities includes, 
moreover, the determination of the employment of the additional 
capital goods accumulated by new savings. The injection of these 
additiona1 capital goods is bbund to increase the total sum of the 
income produced, i.e., of that supply of consumers' goods which can 
be consu~ned without diminishing the capital equipment used in its 
production and thereby without impairing the output of future 
production. The increase of income is effected either by an expan- 
sion of production without altering the technological methods of 
production or by an improvement in technoIogica1 methods which

popular speech, we would have to say that no part of national income goes into 
profits.

The Market 

would not have been feasible under the previous conditions of a less 
ample supply of capital goods. 

It is out of this additional wealth that the surplus of the total sum of 
entrepreneurial profits over the total sum of entrepreneurial losses 
flows. But it can be easily demonstrated that this surplus can never 
exhaust the total increase in wealth brought about by economic prog- 
ress. The laws of the market divide this additional wealth between 
the entrepreneurs and the suppliers of labor and those of certain 
material factors of production in such a way that thc lion's share goes 
to the nonentrepreneurial groups. 

First of all we must realize that entrepreneurial profits are not a 
lasting phenomenon but only temporary. There prcvails an inherent 
tendency for profits and losses to disappear. The market is always 
moving toward the emergence of the final prices and the finaI state 
of rest. If new changes in the data were not to interrupt this move- 
ment and not to create the need for a new adjustment of production 
to the altered conditions, the prices of all complementary factors of 
production would-due allowance being rnade for time preference 
-finally equal the price of the product, and nothing would be left for 
profits or losses. In the long run every increase in productivity bene- 
fits exclusively the workers and some groups of the owners of land 
and of capital goods. 

In the groups of the owners of capital goods there are benefited: 

I. Those whose saving has increased the quantity of capital goods 
available. They own this additional wealth, the outcome of their 
restraint in consuming. 
2. The owners of those capital goods already previously existing 
which, thanks to the improvement in technological methods of pro- 
duction, are now better utilized than before. Such gains are, of course, 
temporary only. They are bound to disappear as they cause a tend- 
ency toward an intensified production of the capital goods concerned. 
On the other hand, the increase in the quantity of capital goods 
available lowers the marginal productivity of capital; it thus brings 
about a fall in the prices of the capital goods and thereby hurts the 
interests of all those capitalists who did not share at all or not suffi- 
ciently in the process of saving and the accumulation of the additional 
supply of capital goods. 

In the group of the landowners all those are benefited for whom 
the new state of affairs results in a higher productivity of their farms, 
forests, fisheries, mines, and so on. On the other hand, all those are 
hurt whose property may become submarginal on account of the 
higher return yielded by the land owned by those benefited. 


Human Action 

In the group of labor all derive a lasting gain from the increase in 

the marginal productivity of labor. But, on the other hand, in the 

short run some may suffer disadvantages. These are people who were 

specialized in the performancc of work which becomes obsolete 

as a result of technological improvement and are fitted only for jobs 

in which-in spite of the general rise in wage rates-they earn less 

than before. 

All these changes in the prices of the factors of production begin 
immediately with the initiation of the entrepreneurial actions designed 
to adjust the processes of production to the new state of affairs. In 
dealing with this problem as with the other problems of changes in 
the market data, we must guard ourselves against the popular fallacy 
of drawing a sharp line between short-run and long-run effects. What 
happens in the short run is precisely the first stages of the chain of 
successive transformations which tend to bring about the long-run 
effects. The long-run effect is in our case the disappearance of entre- 
preneurial profits and losses. The short-run effects are the preliminary 
stages of this process of elimination which finally, if not interrupted 
by a further change in the data, would result in the cmergence of 
the evenly rotating economy. 

It is necessary to comprehend that the very appearance of an ex- 
cess in the total amount of entrepreneurial profits ovcr the total 
amount of entrepreneurial losses depends upon the fact that this 
process of the elimination of entrepreneurial profit and loss begins at 
the same time as the entrepreneurs begin to adjust the complex of 
production activities to the changed data. There is never in the whole 
sequence of events an instant in which the advantages derived from 
the increase in the amount of capital available and from technical 
improvements benefit the entrepreneurs only. If the wealth and the 
income of the other strata were to remain unaffected, these people 
couId buy the additional products only by restricting their pur- 
chases of other products accordingly. Thcn the profits of one group 
of entrepreneurs would exactly equal the losses incurred by other 
groups. 

What happens is this: The entrepreneurs embarking upon the uti- 
lization of the newly accumulated capital goods and the improved 
technological methods of production are in need of complementary 
factors of production. Their demand for these factors is a new ad-
ditional demand which must raise their prices. Only as far as this rise 
in prices and wage rates occurs, are the consumers in a position to buy 
the new products without curtailing the purchase of other goods. 


The Market 

Only so far can a surplus of the total sum of a11 entrepreneurial profits 
over all entrepreneurial losses come into existence. 

The vehicle of economic progress is the accumulation of additional 
capital goods by means of saving and improvement in technological 
methods of production the execution of which is almost always con- 
ditioned by the availability of such new capitaI. The agents of progress 
are the promoting entrepreneurs intent upon profiting by means of 
adjusting the conduct of affairs to the best possible satisfaction of the 
consumers. In the performance of their projects for the realization of 
progress they are bound to share the benefits derived from progress 
with the workers and also w-ith a part of the capitalists and landowners 
and to increase the portion allotted to these people step by step until 
their own sharc melts away entirely. 

From this it becomes evident that it is absurd to speak of a "rate 
of profit" or a "normal rate of profit" or an "average rate of profit." 
Profit is not related to or dependent on the amount of capital em- 
ployed by the entreprcneur. Capital does not "beget" profit. Profit 
and loss are entircly determined by the success or failure of the 
entrepreneur to adjust production to the demand of the consumers. 
There is nothing "normal" in profits and there can never be an 
"equilibrium" with regard to them. Profit and loss are, on the contrary, 
always a phenomcnon of a deviation from "normalcy," of changes 
unforeseen by the majority, and of a "disequilibrium." They have 
no place in an imaginary world of normalcy and equilibrium. In a 
changing cconomy there prevails always an inhercnt tendency for 
profits and losses to disappear. It is only the cmergencc of new changes 
which revives them again. Under stationary conditions the "average 
rate" of profits and losses is zero. An excess of the total amount of 
profits over that of losses is a proof of the fact that there is economic 
progress and an improvement in the standard of living of all strata 
of the population. The greater this excess is, the greater is the in- 
crement in general prosperity. 

R4any people are utterly unfit to deal with the phenomenon of 

entrepreneurial profit without indulging in envious resentment. In 

their eyes the source of profit is exploitation of the wage earners and 

the consumers, i.e., an unfair reduction in wage rates and a no less 

unfair increase in the prices of the products. By rights there should 

not be any profits at all. 

Economics is indifferent with regard to such arbitrary vaIue judg- 

ments. It is not interested in the problem of whether profits are to be 

approved or condemned from thc point of view of an alleged natural 


Human Action 

law and of an alleged eternal and immutable code of morality about 
which personal intuition or divine revelation are supposed to convey 
precise information. Economics merely establishes the fact that entre- 
preneurial profits and losses are essential phenomena of the market 
economy. There cannot be a market economy without them. It is 
certainly possible for the police to confiscate all profits. But such 
a policy would by necessity convert the market economy into a 
senseless chaos. Man has, there is no doubt, the power to destroy many 
things, and he has made in the course of history ample use of this 
faculty. He could destroy the market economy too. 

If those self-styled moralists were not blinded by their envy, they 
would not deal with profit without dealing simultaneously with its 
corollary, loss. They would not pass over in silence the fact that 
the preliminary conditions of economic i~nprovement arc an achieve- 
ment of those whose saving accumulates the additional capital goods 
and of the inventors, and that the utilization of these conditions for 
the realization of economic improvement is effected by the entre- 
preneurs. The rest of the people do not contribute to progress, but 
they are benefited by the horn of plenty which other people's activities 
pour upon them. 

What has been said about the progressing economy is wmtatis 
mutandis to be applied to the conditions of a retrogressing economy, 
i.e., an economy in which the per capita quota of capital invested is 
decreasing. In such an economy there is an excess in the total sum of 
entrepreneurial losses over that of profits. People who cannot free 
themselves from the fallacy of thinking in concepts of collectives 
and whole groups might raise the question of how in such a retro-
gressing economy there could be any entrepreneurial activity at all. 
Why should anybody embark upon an enterprise if he ltnows in 
advance that mathematically his chance of earning profits arc smaller 
than those of suffering losses? However, this mode of posing the 
~rnhlemis fallacious. Like other people? entrepreneurs do not act as 
members of a class, bur as individuals. No entrepreneur bothers a whit 
about the fate of the totality of the entrepreneurs. It is irrelevant to 
the individual entrepreneur what happens to other people whom 
theories, according to a certain characteristic, assign to the same class 
they assign hi~n. In the living, perpetually changing market society 
there are always profits to be earned by efficient entrepreneurs. The 
fact that in a retrogressing economy the total amount of losses exceeds 
the total amount of profits does not deter a man who has confidence 
in his own superior efficiency. A prospective entrepreneur does not 
consult the calculus of probability which is of no avail in the field of 


The Market 297 

understanding. He trusts his own ability to understand future market 
conditions better than his less gifted fellow men. 

The entrepreneurial function, the striving of entrepreneurs after 
profits, is the driving power in the market economy. Profit and loss 
are the devices by means of which the consumers exercise their 
supremacy on the market. The behavior of the consumers makes 
profits and losses appear and thereby shifts ownership of the means 
of production from the hands of the less efficient into those of the 
more efficient. It makes a man the more influential in the direction of 
business activities the better he succeeds in serving the consumers. In 
the absence of profit: and loss the entrepreneurs would not know 
what the most urgent needs of the consumers are. If some entre- 
preneurs were to guess it, they would lack the means to adjust pro- 
duction accordingly. 

Profit-seeking business is subject to the sovereignty of the con- 
sumers, while nonprofit institutions are sovereign unto themselves 
and not responsible to the public. Production for profit is necessarily 
production for use, as profits can only be earned by providing the 
consumers with those things they most urgently want to use. 

The moralists' and sermonizers' critique of profits misses the point. 
It is not the fault of the entrepreneurs that the consumers-the people, 
the common man-prefer liquor to Bibles and detective stories to 
serious books, and that governments prefer guns to butter. The entre- 
preneur does not make greater profits in selling "bad" things than 
in selling "good" things. His profits are the greater the better he 
succeeds in providing the consumers with those things they ask for 
most intensely. People do not drink intoxicating beverages in order 
to make the "alcohol capital" happy, and thcy do not go to war in 
order to increase the profits of the "merchants of death." The exist- 
ence of the armaments industries is a consequence of the warlike 
spirit, not its cause. 

It is not the business of the entrepreneurs to make people substitute 
sound ideologies for unsound. It rests with the philosophers to change 
people's ideas and ideals. The entrepreneur serves the consumers as 
thcy are today, however wicked and ignorant. 

We may admire those who abstain from making gains they co~lld 
reap in producing deadly weapons or hard liquor. However, their 
laudable conduct is a mere gesture without any practical effects. Even 
if all entrepreneurs and capitalists were to follow their example, wars 
and dipsomania would not disappear. As was the case in the pre- 
capitalistic ages, governments would produce the weapons in their 
own arsenals and drinkers would distill their own liquor.

Sonze Observations on the Underconsumption 
Bogey and on the Purchclsing Power Argument 


In speaking of underconsumption, people mean to describe a state of 
affairs in which a part of the goods produced cannot be consumed because 
the people who could consume them arc by their poverty prevented from 
buying them. These goods remain unsold or can be swapped only at prices 
not covering the cost of production. Hence various disarrangements and 
disturbances arise, the total complex of which is called economic depres- 
sion. 

Now it happens again and again that entrepreneurs err in anticipating the 
future state of the market. Instead of producing those goods for which the 
demand of the consumers is most intense, they produce less urgently 
needed goods or things which cannot be sold at all. These inefficient entre- 
preneurs suffer losses while their more efficient competitors who antici- 
pated the wishes of the consumers earn profits. The losses of the former 
group of entrepreneurs are not caused by a general abstention from buying 
in the part of the public; they arc due to the fact that the public prefers to 
buy other goods. 

If it were true, as the underconsumption myth implies, that the workers 
are too poor to buy the products because the entrepreneurs and the capi- 
talists unfairly appropriate to themselves what by rights should go to the 
wage earners, the state of affairs would not be altered. The "exploiters" 
are not supposed to exploit from sheer wantonness. They want, it is in- 
sinuated, to increase at the expense of the "exploited" either their own 
consumption or their own investments. They do not wichdraw their booty 
from the universe. They spend it either in buying luxuries for their own 
household or in buying producers' goods for the expansion of their enter- 
prises. Of course, their demand is directed toward goods other than those 
the wage earners would have bought if the profits had been confiscated and 
distributed among them. Entrepreneurial errors with regard to the state of 
the market of various classes of commodities as created by such "exploita- 
tion" are in no way different from any other entrepreneurial shortcomings. 
Entrepreneurial errors result in losses for the inefficient entrepreneurs 
which are counterbalanced by the profits of the efficient entrepreneurs. 
They make business bad for some groups of industries and good for other 
groups. They do not bring about a general depression of trade. 

The underconsumption myth is baseless self-contradictory balderdash. 
Its reasoning crumbles away as soon as one begins to examine it. It is un- 
tenable even if one, for the sake of argument, accepts thc "exploitation" 
doctrine as correct. 

The purchasing power argument runs in a slightly different manner. 
It contends that a rise in wage rates is a prerequisite of the expansion of 
production. If wage rates do not rise, there is no use for business to increase 
the quantity and to improve the quality of the goods produced. For the 


The Market 

additional products would find no buyers or only such buyers as restrict 
their purchases of other goods. What is needed first for the realization of 
economic progress is to make wage rates rise continually. Government or 
labor union pressure and compulsion aiming at the enforcement of higher 
wage rates are the main vehicles of progress. 

As has been demonstrated above the emergence of an excess in the total 
sum of entrepreneurial profits over the total sum of entrepreneurial losses 
is inseparably hound up with the fact that a portion of the benefits derived 
from the increase in the quantity of capital goods available and from 
the improvement of technological procedures goes to the nonentrepreneur- 
ial groups. The rise in the prices of complementary factors of production, 
first among them wage rates, is neither a concession which the entrepre- 
neurs willy-nilly must make to the rest of the people nor a clever device of 
the entrepreneurs in order to make profits. It is an unavoidable and neces- 
sary phenomenon in the chain of successive events which the endeavors of 
the entrepreneurs to make profits by adjusting the supply of the consumers' 
goods to the new state of affairs are bound to bring about. The same process 
which results in an excess of entrepreneurial profits over losses causes first 
-i.e., before such an excess appears-the emergence of a tendency toward 
a rise in wage rates and in the prices of many material factors of production. 
And it is again the same process that would in the further course of events 
make this excess of profits over losses disappear, provided that no further 
changes, increasing the amount of capital goods available, were to occur. 
The cxcess of profits over losses is not a consequence of the rise in the prices 
of the factors of production. The two phenomena-the rise in the prices of 
the factors of production and the excess of profits over losses-are both 
steps in the process of adjustment of production to the increase in the quan- 
tity of capital goods and to the technological changes which the entrepre- 
neurial actions actuate. Only to the extent that the other strata of the popu- 
lation are enriched by this adjustment can an excess of profits over losses 
temporarily come into being. 

The basic error of the purchasing power argument consists in miscon- 
struing this causal relation. It turns things upside down when considering 
the rise in wage rates as the force bringing about economic improvement. 

We will discuss at a later stage of this book the consequences of the at- 
tempts of the governments and of organized labor violence to enforce wage 
rates higher than those determined by a nonharnpered market.?l Here we 
must only add one more explanatory remark. 

When speaking of profits and losses, priccs and wage rates, what we 
have in mind is always real profits and losses, real prices and real wage 
rates. It is the arbitrary interchange of money terms and real terms that 
has led many people astray. This problem too will be dealt with exhaus- 
tively in later chapters. Let us incidentally only mention the fact that a 
rise in real wage rates is compatible with a drop in nominal wage rates.

I o. Promoters, Managers, Technicians, and Bureaucrats 

The entrepreneur hires the technicians, i.e., people who have the 
ability and the skill to perform definite kinds and quantities of work. 
The class of technicians includes the great inventors, the champions 
in the field of applied science, the constructors and designers as we11 
as the performers of the most simple tasks. The entrepreneur joins 
their ranks as far as he himself takes part in the technical execution of 
his entrepreneurial plans. The technician contributes his own toil 
and trouble; but it is the entrepreneur qua entrepreneur who directs 
his labor toward definite goals. And the entrepreneur himself acts as a 
mandatary, as it were, of the consumers. 

The entrepreneurs are not omnipresent. They cannot themselves 
attend to the manifold tasks which are incumbent upon them. Adjust- 
ment of production to the best possible supplying of the consumers 
with the goods they are asking for most urgently does not merely 
consist in determining the general plan for the utilization of resources. 
There is, of course, no doubt that this is the main function of the 
promoter and speculator. But besides the great adjustments, many 
small adjustments are necessary too. Each of them may seem trifling 
and of little bearing upon the total result. But the cumulative effect 
of shortcomings in many of these minor matters can be such as to 
frustrate entirely the success of a correct solution of the great prob- 
lems. At any rate, it is certain that every failure to handle the smaller 
problems results in a squandering of scarce factors of production and 
consequently in impairing the best possible satisfaction of the con- 
sumers. 

It is important to conceive in what respects the problem we have 
in mind differs from the technological tasks of the technicians. The 
execution of every project upon which the entrepreneur has em- 
barked in making his decision ~411regard to the general plan of 
action requires a multiplicity of minute decisions. Each of these de- 
cisions must be efiected in such a way as to prefer that soiution of 
the problem which-without interfering with the designs of the 
general plan for the whole project-is the most economical one. It 
must avoid superfluous costs in the same way as does the general plan. 
The technician from his purely technological point of view either 
may not see any difference in the alternatives offered by various 
meihods for thesolution of such a detail or may give preference to 
one of these methods on account of its greater output in phvsical 
quantities. But the entrepreneur is actuated by the profit motive: This 
enjoins upon him the urge to prefer the most economical solution, i.e., 


The Market 301 

that solution which avoids employing factors of production whose 
employment would impair the satisfaction of the more intensely felt 
wants of the consumcrs. He will prefer among the various methods 
with regard to which the technicians are neutral, the one the applica- 
tion of which requires the smaIlest cost. He may reject the techni- 
cians' suggestion to choose a more costly method securing a greater 
physical output if his calculation shows that the increase in output 
would not outweigh the increase in cost required. Not only in the 
great decisions and plans but no less in the daily decisions of small 
problems as they turn up in the current conduct of affairs, the entre- 
preneur must perform his task of adjusting production to the demand 
of the consumers as reflected in the prices of the market. 

Economic calculation as practiced in the market economy, and 
especialIy the system of double-entry bookkeeping, make it possible 
to reIieve the entrepreneur of involvement in too much detail. He 
can devote himself to his great tasks without being entangled in a 
multitude of trifles beyond any mortal man's range of sight. He can 
appoint assistants to whose solicitude he entrusts the care of subordi- 
nate entrepreneurial duties. And these assistants in their turn can be 
aided according to the same principle by assistants appointed for a 
smaller sphere of duties. In this way a whole managerial hierarchy 
can be built up. 

A manager is a junior partner of thc entrepreneur, as it were, no 
matter what the contractual and financial terms of his employment 
are. The only relevant thing is that his own financial interests force 
him to attend to the best of his abilities to the entrepreneurial func- 
tions which are assigned to him within a limited and precisely deter- 
mined sphere of action. 

It is the system of double-entv bookkeeping that makes the 
functioning of the managerial syste& possible. Thanks to it the entre- 
prencur is in a position to separate the calculation of each part of his 
total enterprise in such a way that he can determine the role it plays 
within his whole enterprise. Thus he can look at each section as if it 
were a separatc entity and can appraise it according to the share it 
contributes to the success of the total enterprisc. Within this system 
of business calculation each section of a firm represents an integral 
entity, a hypothetical independent business, as it were. It is assumed 
that this section "owns" a definite part of the whole capital employed 
in the enterprise, that it buys from other sections and sells to them, 
that it has its own expenses and its own revenues, that its dealings re- 
sult either in a profit or in a loss which is imputed to its own conduct 
of affairs as distinguished from the result of the other sections. Thus 


Human Action 
the entrepreneur can assign to each section's management a great deal 
of indepcndence. The only directive he gives to a man whom he en- 
trusts with the managerncnt of a circumscribed job is to make as 
much profit as possible. An examination of the accounts shows how 
successful or unsuccessful the managers were in exccuting this direc- 
tive. Every tnanagcr and submanager is responsible for the working 
of his section or subsection. It is to his credit if the accounts show 
a profit, and it is to his disadvantage if they show a loss. His own in- 
terests impel him toward the utmost care and exertion in the con- 
duct of his section's affairs. If he incurs losses, he will be replaced by 
a man whom the entrepreneur expects to be more successful, or the 
whole section will be discontinued. At any rate, the manager will 
lose his job. If he succeeds in making profits, his income will be in- 
creased, or at least he will not be in danger of losing it. Whether or 
not a manager is entitled to a share in the profit imputed to his section 
is not important with regard to the personal intcrest he takes in the 
results of his section's dealings. His welfare is at any rate closely con- 
nected with that of his section. His task is not like that of the techni- 
cian, to perform a definite piece of work according to a definite pre- 
cept. It is to adjust-within the limited scope left to his discretion- 
the opcration of his section to the state of the market. Of course, just 
as an entrepreneur may combine in his person entrepreneurial func- 
tions and those of a technician, such a union of various functions can 
also occur with a manager. 
The managerial function is aIways subservient to the entrepre- 
neurial function. It can relieve the entrepreneur of a part of his minor 
duties; it can never evolve into a substitute for entrepreneurship. 
The fallacy to the contrary is due to the error confusing the category 
of entrepreneurship as it is defined in the imaginary construction of 
functional distribution with conditions in a living and operating mar- 
ket economy. The function of the entrepreneur cannot be separated 
from the direction of the employment of factors of production for 
the accomplishment of definite tasks. The entrcpreneur controIs the 
factors of production; it is this control that brings him either entre- 
preneurial profit or loss. 
It is possible to reward the manager by paying for his services in 
proportion to the contribution of his section to the profit earned by 
the entrepreneur. But this is of no avail. As has been pointed out, the 
managcr is under any circumstances interested in the success of that 
part of the business which is entrusted to his care. But the manager 
cannot be made answerable for the losses incurred. These losses are 


The Market 303 

suffered by the owners of the capital employed. They cannot be 
shifted to the manager. 

Society can freely leave the care for the best possible employment 
of capital goods to their owners. In embarking upon definite projects 
these owners expose their own property, wealth, and social position. 
They are even more interested in the success of their entrepreneurial 
activities than is society as a whole. For society as a whole the squan- 
dering of capital invested in a definite project means only the loss of 
a small part of its total funds; for the owner it means much more, for 
the most part the loss of his total fortune. But if a manager is given 
a completely free band, things are different. He speculates in risking 
other people's money. He sees the prospects of an uncertain enter- 
prise from another angle than that of the man who is answerable for 
the losses. It is precisely when he is rewarded by a share of the profits 
that he becomes foolhardy because he does not share in the losses too. 

The illusion that management is the totality of entrepreneurial 
activities and that management is a perfect substitute for entrepre- 
neurship is the outgrowth of a misinterpretation of the conditions of 
the corporations, the typical form of present-day business. It is as- 
serted that the corporation is operated by the salaried managers, while 
the shareholders are merely passive spectators. All the powers are 
concentrated in the hands of hired employees. The shareholders are 
idle and useless; they harvest what the managers have sown. 

This doctrine disregards entireIy the role that the capital and 
money market, the stock and bond exchange, which a pertinent 
idiom simply calls the "market," plays in the direction of corporate 
business. The dealings of this market are branded by popular anti- 
capitalistic bias as a hazardous game, as mere gambling. In fact, the 
changes in the prices of common and preferred stock and of corporate 
bonds are the means applied by the capitalists for the supreme control 
of the flow of capital. The price structure as determined by the 
speculations on the capital and money markets and on the big com- 
~nodity exchanges not only decides how much capital is available for 
the conduct of each corporation's business; it creates a state of affairs 
to which the managers must adjust their operations in detail. 

The general direction of a corporation's conduct of business is 
exercised by the stockholders and their elected mandataries, the 
directors. The directors appoint and discharge the managers. In 
smaller companies and sometimes even in bigger ones the offices of the 
directors and the managers are often combined in the same persons. 
A successful corporation is ultimately never controlled by hired 


Human Action 

managers. Thc emergence of an omnipotent managerial class is not 
a phenomenon of the unhampered market economy. It was, on the 
contrary, an outgrowth of the interventionist policies consciously 
aiming at an elimination of the influence of the shareholders and at 
thcir virtual expropriation. In Germany, Italy, and Austria it was a 
preliminary step on the way toward the substitution of government 
control of business for free enterprise, as has been the case in Great 
Britain with regard to the Bank of England and the railroads. Similar 
tendencies are prevalent in the American public utilities. The marvel- 
ous achievements of corporate business were not a result of the activi- 
tics of a salaried managcrjal oligarchy; they were accomplished by 
people who were connected with the corporation by means of the 
ownership of a considerable part or of the greater part of its stock and 
whom part of the public scorned as promoters and profiteers. 

The entreprcneur determincs alone, without any managerial inter- 
ference, in what lines of business to employ capital and how much 
capital to employ. He determines the expansion and contraction of 
the size of the total business and its main sections. He determines the 
enterprise's financial structure. These are the essential decisions which 
are instrumental in the conduct of business. They always fall upon 
the entreprcneur, in corporations as well as in other types of a firm's 
legal structure. Any assistance given to the entrepreneur in this re-
gard is of ancillary character only; he takes information about the 
past state of affairs from experts in the fields of law, statistics, and 
technology; but the finaI decision implying a judgment about the 
future state of the market rests with him alone. The execution of the 
details of his projects may then be entrusted to managers. 

The social functions of the managerial elite are no less indispensable 
for the operation of the market economy than are the functions of the 
elite of inventors, technologists, engineers, designers, scientists, and 
experimcnters. In the ranks of the managers many of the most eminent 
mcn serve the cause of economic progress. Successful managers are 
remunerated by high salaries and often by a share in the enterprise's 
gross profits. Many of them in the couise of their careers become 
themselves capitalists and entrepreneurs. Nonetheless, the managerial 
function is different from the entrepreneurial function. 

It is a serious mistake to identify entrepreneurship with manage- 
ment as in the popular antithesis of "management" and "labor." This 
confusion is, of course, intentional. It is designed to obscure the fact 
that the functions of entrcpreneurship are entirely different from 
those of the managers attending to the minor details of the conduct 
of business. The structure of business, the allocation of capital to the 


The Market 

various branches of production and firms, the size and the line of 
operation of each plant and shop are considered as given facts and it 
is implied that no further changes will be effected with regard to 
them. The onIy task is to go on in the oid routine. In such a stationary 
world, of course, there is no need for innovators and promoters; the 
total amount of profits is counterbalanced by the total amount of 
losses. To explode the fallacies of this doctrine it is enough to compare 
the structure of American business in I 945 with that of 1915. 

But even in a stationary world it would be nonsensical to give 
"labor," as a popular slogan demands, a share in management. The 
realization of such a postulate would result in syndi~alism.~~ 

There is furthermore a readiness to confuse the manager with a 
bureaucrat. 

Burcnucratic management, as distinguished from pofit manage-
ment, is the method applied in the conduct of administrative affairs, 
the result of which has no cash value on the market. The successful 
performance of the duties entrusted to the care of a police depart- 
ment is of the greatest importance for the preservation of social co- 
operation and benefits each member of society. But it has no price on 
the market, it cannot be bought or sold; it can therefore not be con- 
fronted with the expenses incurred in the endeavors to secure it. It 
results in gains, but these gains are not reflected in profits liable to 
expression in terms of money. The methods of economic calculation, 
and especially those of double-entry bookkeeping, are not applicable 
to them. ~u&ess or failure of a department's activities cannot 
be ascertained according to the arithmetical procedures of profit- 
seeking business. No accountant can establish whether or not a police 
department or one of its subdivisions has succeeded. 

The amount of money to he expended in every branch of profit- 
seeking business is determined by the behavior of the consumers. Tf 
the automobile industry were to treble the capital employed, it 
would certainly improve the services it renders to the public.'There 
would be more cars available. But this expansion of the industry would 
withhold capital from other branches of production in which it 
could fill more urgent wants of the consumers. This fact would render 
the expansion of the automobile industry unprofitable and increase 
profits in other branches of business. In their endeavors to strive after 
the highest profit obtainable, entrepreneurs are forced to allocate to 
each branch of business only as much capital as can be employed in it 
without impairing the satisfaction of more urgent wants of the con- 
sumers. Thus the entrepreneurial activities are automatically, as it

were, directed by the consumers' wishes as they are reflected in the 
price structure of consumers' goods. 

No such limitation is enjoined upon the allocation of funds for the 
performance of the tasks incumbent upon government activities. 
There is no doubt that the services rendered by the police depart- 
ment of the City of Sew York could be considerably improved by 
trebling the budgetary allocation. But the question is whether or not 
this improvement would be considerable enough to justify either the 
restriction of the services rendered by other departments-e.g., those 
of the department of sanitation-or the restriction of the private con- 
sumption of the taxpayers. This question cannot be answered by the 
accounts of the police department. These accounts provide informa- 
tion only about the expenses incurred. They cannot provide any in- 
formation about the results obtained, as these results cannot be ex- 
pressed in money equivalents. The citizens must directly determine 
the amount of services they want to get and are ready to pay for. They 
discharge this task by electing councilmen and officeholders who are 
prepared to comply with their intentions. 

Thus the mayor and the chiefs of the city's various departments are 
restricted by the budget. They are not free to act upon what they 
themselves consider the most beneficial solution of the various prob- 
lems the citizenry has to face. They are bound to spend the funds 
allocated for the purposes the budget has assigned them. They must 
not use them for other tasks. Auditing in the field of public adminis- 
tration is entirely different from that in the field of profit-seeking 
business. Its goal is to establish whether or not the funds allocated 
have been expended in strict compliance with the provisions of the 
budget. 

In profit-seeking business the discretion of the managers and sub- 
managers is restricted by considerations of profit and loss. The profit 
motive is the only directive needed to make them subservient to the 
wishes of the consumers. There is no need to restrict their discretion 
by mi~uteinstructinns and mks. If thev arc efiicient, such zedd!in-5 
with details would at best be superfluous, if not pernicious in tving 
their hands. If they are inefficient, it would not render their actiiities 
more successful. It would only provide them with a lame excuse that 
the failure was caused by inappropriate rules. The only instruction 
required is self-understood and does not need to be especiallv men- 
tioned: Seek profit. 

Things are different in public administration, in the conduct of 

government affairs. In this field the discretion of the officeholders 

and their subaltern aids is not restricted by considerations of profit 


The Market 

and loss. If their supreme boss-no matter whether he is the sovereign 
people or a sovereign despot-were to leave them a free hand, he 
would renounce his own supremacy in their favor. These officers 
would become irresponsible agents, and their power would supersede 
that of the ~eople or the despot. They would do what pleased them, 
not what their bosses wanted them to do. To prevent thisoutcome and 
to make them subservient to the will of their bosses it is necessary 
to give them detailed instructions regulating their conduct of affairs 
in every respect. Then it becomes their duty to handle all affairs in 
strict compliance with these ruIes and regulations. Their freedom to 
adjust their acts to what seems to them the most appropriate solution 
of a concrete problem is limited by these norms. They are bureaucrats, 
i.e., men who in every instance must observe a set of inflexible regula- 
tions. 

Bureaucratic conduct of affairs is conduct bound to comply with 
detailed rules and regulations fixed by the authority of a superior 
body. It is the only alternative to profit management. Profit manage- 
ment is inapplicable in the pursuit of affairs whicli have no cash value 
on the market and in the non-profit conduct of affairs which could 
also be operated on a profit basis. The former is the case of the ad- 
n~inistration of the social apparatus of coercion and compulsion; the 
latter is the case in the conduct of an institution on a non-profit basis, 
e.g., a school, a hospital, or a postal system. Whenever the operation 
of a system is not directed by the profit motive, it must be directed 
by bureaucratic rules. 

Bureaucratic conduct of affairs is, as such, not an eviI. It is the only 
appropriate method of handling governmental affairs, i.e., the social 
apparatus of compulsion and coercion. As government is necessary, 
bureaucratism is-in this field-no less necessary. Where economic 
calculation is unfeasible, bureaucratic methods are indispensable. A 
socialist government must apply them to all affairs. 

No business, whatever its size or specific task, can ever become 
bureaucratic so long as it is entirely and solely operated on a profit 
basis. But as soon as it abandons profit-seeking and substitutes for it 
what is called the service principle-ie., the rendering of services 
without regard as to whether or not the prices to be obtained for then1 
cover the expenses-it must adopt bureaucratic methods for those of 
entrepreneurial manage men^^^

(New Haven, I 944). 

Human Action 

I I. The Selective Process 
The selective process of the market is actuated by the composite 
effort of all members of the market economy. Driven by the urge 
to remove his own uneasiness as much as possible, each individual is 
intent, on the one hand, upon attaining that position in which he can 
contribute most to the best satisfaction of everyone else and, on the 
other hand, upon taking best advantage of the services offered by 
everyone else. This means that he tries to sell on the dearest market 
and to buy on the cheapest market. The resultant of these endeavors 
is not only the price structure but no less the social structure, the 
assignment of definite tasks to the various individuals. The market 
makes people rich or poor, determines who shall run the big plants 
and who shall scrub the floors, fixes how many peopIe shall work 
in the copper mines and how many in the symphony orchestras. None 
of these dccisions is made once and for all; they are revocable every 
day. The selective process never stops. It goes on adjusting the social 
apparatus of production to the changes in demand and supply. It 
reviews again and again its previous decisions and forces everybody 
to submit to a new examination of his case. There is no security and 
no such thing as a right to preserve any position acquired in the past. 
Nobody is exempt from the law of the market, the consumers' sover- 
eignty. 

Ownership of the means of production is not a privilege, but a 
social liability. Capitalists and landowners are compelled to employ 
their property for the best possible sarjsfaction of the consumers. 
If they are slow and inept in the performance of their duties, they 
are penalized by losses. If they do not learn the lesson and do not re- 
form their conduct of affairs, they lose their wealth. No investment 
is safe forever. He who does not use his property in serving the con- 
sumers in the most efficient way is doomed to failure. There is no 
room left for people who would like to enjoy their fortunes in idle- 
ness and thoughtIessness. The proprietor must aim to invest his funds 
in such a way that principal and yield are at least not impaired. 

In the ages of caste privileges and trade barriers there were revenues 
not dependent on the market. Princes and lords lived at the expense 
of the humble slaves and serfs who owed them tithes, statute labor, 
and tributes. Ownership of land could only be acquired either by 
conquest or by largesse on the part of a conqueror. It could be for- 
feited only by recantation on the part of the donor or by conquest on 
the part of another conqueror. Even later, when the lords and their 
liegemen began to sell their surpluses on the market, they could not 


The Market 309 

be ousted by the competition of more efficient people. Competition 
was free only within very narrow limits. The acquisition of manorial 
estates was reserved to the nobility, that of urban real property to the 
citizens of the township, that of farm land to the peasants. Competi- 
tion in the arts and crafts was restricted by the guilds. The consumers 
were not in a position to satisfy their wants in the cheapest way, as 
price control made underbidding impossible to the sellers. The buyers 
were at the mercy of their purveyors. If the privileged producers re- 
fused to resort to the employment of the most adequate raw materials 
and of the most efficient methods of processing, the consumers were 
forced to endure the consequences of such stubbornness and conserv- 

atism. 

The landowner who lives in perfect self-sufficiency from the fruits 
of his own farming is independent of the market. But the modern 
farmer who buys equipment, fertilizers, seed, labor, and other factors 
of production and sells agricultural products is subject to the law of 
the marltet. His income depends on the consumers and he must ad- 
just his operations to their wishes. 

The selective function of the market works also with regard to 
labor. The worker is attracted by that kind of work in which he can 
expect to earn most. As is the case with material factors of produc- 
tion, the factor labor too is allocated to those employments in which 
it best serves the consumers. There prevails the tendency not to waste 
any quantity of labor for the satisfaction of less urgent demand if 
more urgent demand is still unsatisfied. Like a11 other strata of society, 
the worker is subject to the supremacy of the consumers. If he dis- 
obeys, he is penalized by a cut in income. 

The selection of the market does not establish social orders, castes, 

or classes in the Marxian sense. Nor do the entrepreneurs and pro- 

moters form an integrated social class. Each individual is free to be- 

come a promoter if he relies upon his own ability to anticipate future 

marltet conditions better than his fellow citizens and if his attempts 

to act at his own peril and on his own responsibility are approved by 

the consumers. One enters the ranks of the promoters by aggressively 

pushing forward and thus submitting to the trial to which the market 

subjects, without respect for persons, everybody who wants to be- 

come a promoter or to remain in this eminent position. Everybody 

has the opportunity to take his chance. A newcomer does not need 

to wait for an invitation or encouragement from anyone. He must 

leap forward on his own account and must himself know how to 

provide the means needed. 

It has been contended again and again that under the conditions 


Human Action 
of "late" or "mature" capitalism it is no longer possible for penniless 
people to climb the ladder to wealth and entrcpreneurial position. 
No attempt has ever been made to prove this thesis. Since it was first 
advanced, the composition of the entrepreneurial and capitalist groups 
has changed considerably. A great part of the former entrepreneurs 
and their heirs have been eliminated and other people, newcomers, 
have taken their places. It is, of course, true that in the last years insti- 
tutions have been purposely developed which, if not abolished very 
soon, will make the functioning of the market in every regard im- 
possible. 
The point of view from which the consumers choose the captains 
of industry and business is exclusively their qualification to adjust 
production to the needs of the consumers. They do not bother about 
other features and merits. They want a shoe manufacturer to fabri- 
cate good and cheap shoes. They are not intent upon entrusting the 
conduct of the shoe trade to handsome amiable boys, to people of 
good drawing-room manners, of artistic gifts, of scholarly habits, or 
of any other virtues or talents. A proficient businessman may often 
be deficient in many accomplishments which contribute to the success 
of a man in other spheres of life. 
It is quite common nowadays to deprecate the capitalists and entre- 
preneurs. A man is prone to sneer at those who are more prosperous 
than himself. These people, he contends, are richer only because they 
are less scrupulous than he. If he were not restrained by due con- 
sideration for the laws of morality and decency, he would be no less 
successful than they are. Thus men glory in the aureole of self-
complacency and Pharisaic self-righteousness. 
Now it is true that under the conditions brought about by inter- 
ventionism many people can acquire wealth by graft and bribery. In 
many countries interventionism has so undermined the supremacy 
of the nlarltet that it is more advantageous for a businessman to rely 
upon the aid of those in political office than upon the best satisfaction 
of the needs of the consumers. But it is not this that the popuiar critics 
of other people's wealth have in mind. They contend that the methods 
by which wealth is acquired in a pure market society are objection- 
able from the ethical point of view. 
Against such statements it is necessary to emphasize that, so far 
as the operation of the market is not sabotaged by the interference of 
governments and other factors of coercion, success in business is the 
proof of services rendered to the consumers. The poor man need not 
be inferior to the prosperous businessman in other regards; he may 
sometimes be outstanding in scientific, literary, and artistic achieve- 


?'he Market 311 

ments or in civic Ieadership. But in the social system of production 
he is inferior. The creative genius may be right in his disdain for 
commercial success; it may be true that he would have been prosper- 
ous in business if he had not preferred other things. But the clerks 
and workers who boast of their moral superiority deceive themsehes 
and find consolation in this self-deception. They do not admit that 
they have been tried and found wanting by their fellow citizens, the 
consumers. 

It is often asserted that the poor man's failure in the competition 
of the market is caused by his lack of education. Equality of oppor- 
tunity, it is said, could be provided only by making education at every 
level accessible to all. There prevails today the tendency to reduce 
all differences among various peoples to their education and to deny 
the existence of inborn inequalities in intellect, will power, and char- 
acter. It is not generally realized that education can never be more 
than indoctrination with theories and ideas already developed. Educa- 
tion, whatever benefits it may confer, is transmission of traditional 
doctrines and valuations; it is by necessity conservative. It produces 
imitation and routine, not improvement and progress. Innovators 
and creative geniuses cannot be reared in schools. They are precisely 
the men who defy what the school has taught them. 

In order to succeed in business a man does not need a degree from 
a school of business administration. These schools train the subalterns 
for routine jobs. They certainly do not train entrepreneurs. An entre- 
preneur cannot be trained. A man becomes an entrepreneur in seizing 
an opportunity and filIing the gap. No special education is required 
for such a display of keen judgment, foresight, and energy. The most 
successful businessmen were often uneducated when measured by the 
scholastic standards of the teaching profession. But they were 
to their social function of adjusting production to the most urgent 
demand. Because of these merits the consumers chose them for 
business Ieadership. 

I 2. The IndividuaI and the Market 

It is customary to speak metaphorically of the automatic and anon- 
ymous forces actuating the "mechanism" of the market. In employ- 
ing such metaphors people are ready to disregard the fact that the 
only factors directing the market and the determination of prices 
are purposive acts of men. There is no automatism; there are only 
men consciously and deliberately aiming at ends chosen. There are 
no mysterious mechanical forces; there is only the human will to re- 


Human Action 

move uneasiness. There is no anonymity; there is I and you and Bill 
and Joe and all the rest. And each of us is both a producer and a con- 
sumer. 

The market is a social body; it is the foremost social body. The 
market phenomena are social phenomena. They are the resultant of 
each individual's active contribution. But they are different from 
each such contribution. They appear to the individual as something 
given which he himsdf cannot alter. He does not always see that he 
himself is a part, although a small part, of the complex of elements 
determining each momentary state of the market. Because he fails 
to realize this fact he feels himself free, in criticizing the market 
phenomena, to condemn with regard to his fellow men a mode of 
conduct which he considers as quite right with regard to himself. 
He blames the market for its callousness and disregard of persons 
and asks for social control of the market in order to "humanize" it. 
He asks on the one hand for measures to protect the consumer against 
the producers. But on the other hand he insists even more passionately 
upon the necessity of protecting himself as a producer against the 
consumers. The outcome of these contradictory demands is the 
modern methods of government interference whose most outstand- 
ing examples were the Sozialpolitik of imperial Germany and the 
American New Deal. 

It is an old fallacy that it is a legitimate task of civiI government to 
protect the less efficient producer against the competition of the 
more efficient. One asks for a "producers' policy" as distinct from 
a "consumers' policy." While flamboyantly repeating the truism that 
the only aim of production is to provide ample supplies for con- 
sumption, people emphasize with no less eloquence that the "indus- 
trious" producer should be protected against the "idle" consumer. 

However, producers and consumers are identical. Production and 

consumption are different stages in acting. Catallactics embodies these 

differences in speaking of producers and consumers. But in reality 

they are the same people. It is, of course, possible to protect a less 

efficient producer against the con~petition of more efficient fellows. 

Such a privilege conveys to the privileged the benefits which the 

unhampered market provides only to those who succeed in best 

filling the wants of the consumers. But it necessarily impairs the 

satisfaction of the consumers. If only one producer or a small group 

is privileged, the beneficiaries enjoy an advantage at the expense of 

the rest of the people. But if all producers are privileged to the same 

extent, everybody loses in his capacity as consumer as much as he 

gains in his capacity as a producer. moreo over, all are injured because 


The Market 313 

the supply of products drops if the most efficient men are prevented 
from empioying their skill in that field in which they could render 
the best services to the consumers. 

If a consumer believes that it is expedient or right to pay a higher 
price for domestic cereals than for cereals imported from abroad, or 
for manufactures ~rocessed in plants operated by small business or 
emploving unionized workers than for those of another provenance, 
he is free to do so. He would only have to satisfy himself that the 
commodity offered for sale meets the conditions upon which he 
makes the allowance of a higher price depend. Laws which forbid 
counterfeiting of labels of origin and trade-marks would succeed 
in attaining the ends aimed at by tariffs, labor legislation, and privi- 
leges granted to small business, But it is beyond doubt that the con- 
sumers are not prepared to act in this way. The fact that a commodity 
is marked as imported does not impair its salabiIity if it is better or 
cheaper, or both. As a rule the buyers want to buy as cheaply as pos- 
sible without regard for the origin of the article or some particular 
characteristics of the producers. 

The psychological root of the producers' policy as practiced to- 
day in alleparts of the world is to be seen in spurious economic doc- 
trines. These doctrines flatly deny that the privileges granted to less 
efficient producers burden the consumer. Their advocates contend 
that such measures are prejudicial only to those against whom they 
discriminate. When, pressed further, they are forced to admit that 
the consumers are damaged too, they maintain that the losses of the 
consumers are more than compensated by an increase in their money 
income which the measures in question are bound to bring about. 

Thus in the predominantly industrial countries of Europe the 
protectionists were first eager to declare that the tariff on agricultural 
products hurts exclusively the interests of the farmers of the predomi- 
nantly agricultural countries and of the grain dealers. It is certain that 
these'exporting interests are damaged too. But it is no less certain 
that the consumers of the country that adopts the tariff policy are 
losing with them. They must pay higher prices for their food. Of 
course, the protectionist retorts, that this is not a burden. For, he 
argues, the additional amount that the domestic consumer pays in- 
creases the farmers' income and their purchasing power; they will 
spend the whole surplus in buying more of the products manufactured 
by the nonagricultural strata of the population. This paralogism can 
easily be exploded by referring to the well-known anecdote of the 
man who asks an innkeeper for a gift of ten dollars; it will not cost 
hiin anything because the beggar promises to spend the whole amount 


Human Action 

in his inn. But for all that, the protectionist fallacy got hold of 
public opinion, and this alone explains the popularity of the measures 
inspired by it. Many people simply do not realize that the only effect 
of protection is to divert production from those places in which it 
could produce more per unit of capital and labor expendcd to places 
in which it produces less. It makes people poorer, not more prosperous. 

The ultimate foundation of modern protectionism and of the striv- 
ing for economic autarky of each country is to be found in this 
mistaken belief that they are the best means to make every citizen, 
or at least the immense majority of them, richer. The term riches 
means in this connection an increase in the individual's real income 
and an improvement in his standard of living. It is true that the 
policy of national economic insulation is a necessary corollary of the 
endeavors to interfere with domestic business, and that it is an out- 
come of warlike tendencies as well as one of the factors producing 
these tendencies. But the fact remains that it would never have been 
possible to sell the idea of protection to the voters if one had not been 
able to convince them that protection not only does not impair their 
standard of living but raises it considerably. 

It is important to emphasize this fact because it utterly explodes 
a myth propagated by many popular books. According to these 
myths, contemporary man is no longer motivated by the desire to 
improve his material well-being and to raise his standard of Iiving. 
The assertions of the economists to the contrary are mistaken. Modern 
man givcs priority to "noneconomic" or "irrational" things and is 
ready to forego material betterment whenever its attainment stands 
in the way of those "ideal" concerns. It is a serious blunder, common 
mostly with economists and businessmen, to interpret the events of 
our time from an "economic" point of view and to criticize current 
ideologies with regard to the alleged economic fallacies implied. 
People long for other things more than for a good life. 

It is hardly possible to misconstrue the history of our age more 
crassly. Our contemporaries are driven by a fanatical zeal to get more 
amenities and by an unrestrained appetite to enjoy life. A character-
istic social phenomenon of our day is the pressure group, an alliance 
of people eager to promote their own material well-being by the 
employment of all means, legal or illegal, peaceful or violent. For 
the pressure group nothing matters but the increase of its members' 
real income. It is not concerned with any other aspects of life. It 
does not bother whether or not the realization of its program hurts 
the vital interests of other men, of their own nation or country, and 
of the whole of mankind. But, of course, every pressure group is 


The A4arket 315 

anxious to justify its demands as beneficial to the general public wel- 
fare and to stigmatize its critics as abject scoundrels, idiots, and trai- 
tors. In the pursuit of its plans it displays a quasi-religious ardor. 

Without exception all political parties promise their supporters 
a higher real income. There is no difference in this respect between 
nationalists and internationalists and between the supporters of a 
market economy and the advocates of either socialism or interven- 
tionism. If a party asks its supporters to make sacrifices for its cause, 
it always explains these sacrifices as the necessary temporary means 
for the attainment of the ultimate goal, the improvement of the 
material well-being of its members. Each party considers it as an 
insidious plot against its prestige and its survival if somebody ventures 
to question the capacity of its projects to n~akc the group members 
Inore prosperous. Each party regards with a deadly hatred the 
economists embarking upon such a critique. 

A11 varieties of the producers' policy are advocated on the ground 
of their alleged ability to raise the parry members' standard of living. 
Protectionism and economic self-suficiency, labor union pressure 
and compulsion, labor legislation, minimum wage rates, public spend- 
ing, credit expansion, subsidies, and other makeshifts are always rec- 
ommended by their advocates as the most suitable or the only means 
to increase the real income of the people for whose votes they canvass. 
Every contemporary statesman or politician invariably tells his voters: 
My program will make yo11 as affluent as conditions &ay permit, while 
my adversaries' program will bring you want and misery. 

It is true that some secluded intellectuals in their esoteric circles 
talk differently. They proclaim the priority of what they call eternaI 
absolute values and feign in their declamations-not in their persona1 
conduct-a disdain of things secular and transitory. But the public 
ignores such utterances. The main goal of present-day political action 
is to secure for the rcspective pressure group memberships the high- 
est material well-bcing. The only way for a leader to succeed is to 
instill in people the conviction that hiiprogram best serves the attain- 
ment of this goal. 

What is wrong with the producers' policies is their faulty eco- 
nomics. 

If one is prepared to indulge in the fashionable tendency to ex- 
plain human things by resorting to the tern~inology of psychopathol- 
ogy, one might be tempted to say that modern man in contrasting a 
producers' policy with a consumers' policy has fallen victim to a kind 
of schizophrenia. He fails to realize that he is an undivided and in-
divisible person, i.e., an individual, and as such no less a consumer than 


Human Action 

a producer. The unity of his consciousness is split into two parts; 
his mind is inwardly divided against himself. But it matters little 
whether or not we adopt this mode of describing the fact that the 
economic doctrine resulting in these policies is faulty. We are not 
concerned with the pathological source from which an error may 
stem, but with the error as such and with its logical roots. The un- 
masking of the error by means of ratiocination is the primary fact. 
If a statement were not exposed as logically erroneous, psychopathol- 
ogy would not be in a position to qualify the state of mind from which 
it stems as pathological. If a man imagines himself to be the king of 
Siam, the first thing which the psychiatrist has to establish is whether 
or not he really is what he believes himself to be. Only if this ques- 
tion is answered in the negative can the man be considered insane. 

It is true that most of our contemporaries are committed to a fal- 
lacious interpretation of the producer-consumer nexus. In buying 
they behave as if they were connected with the market only as buyers, 
and vice versa in selling. As buyers they advocate stern measurks to 
protect them against the sellers, and as sellers they advocate no less 
harsh measures against the buyers. But this antisocial conduct which 
shakes the very foundations of social cooperation is not an outgrowth 
of a pathological state of ~nind. It is the.outcome of a narrow-minded- 
ness which fails to conceive the operation of the market economy 
and to anticipate the ultimate effects of one's own actions. 

It is permissible to contend that the immense majority of our con- 
temporaries are mentally and intellectually not adjusted to life in the 
market society although they themselves and their fathers have un- 
wittingly created this society by their actions. But this maladjustment 
consists in nothing else than in the failure to recognize erroneous 
doctrines as such. 

I 3. Business Propaganda 

The consumer is not omniscient. He does not know where he can 
obtain at the cheapest price what he is looking for. Very often he does 
not even know what kind of commodity or service is suitable to 
remove most efficaciously the particular uneasiness he wants to re- 
move. At best he is familiar with the market conditions of the im-
mediate past and arranges his plans on the basis of this information. 
To convey to him information about the actual state of the marker 
is the task of business propaganda. 

I3usincss propaganda must be obtrusive and blatant. It is its aim 
to attract the attention of slow people, to rouse latent wishes, to 


The Market 317 

entice men to substitute innovation for inert clinging to traditional 
routine. In order to succeed, advertising must be adjusted to the 
mentality of the people courted. It must suit their tastes and speak 
their idiom. Advertising is shrill, noisy, coarse, puffing, because the 
public does not react to dignified allusions. It is the bad taste of the 
public that forces the advertisers to display bad taste in their publicity 
campaigns. The art of advertising has evolved into a branch of applied 
psychology, a sister discipline of pedagogy. 

Like all things designed to suit the taste of the masses, advertising 
is repellent to people of delicate feeling. This abhorrence influences 
the appraisal of business propaganda. Advertising and all other meth- 
ods of business propaganda are condemned as one of the most out- 
rageous outgrowths of unlimited competition. It should be forbidden. 
The consumers should be instructed by impartial experts; the public 
schools, the "nonpartisan" press, and cooperatives should perform 
this task. 

The restriction of the right of businessmen to advertise their 
products would restrict the freedom of the consumers to spend their 
incornc according to their own wants and desires. It would make it 
impossible for them to learn as much as they can and want about the 
state of the market and the conditions which they may consider as 
relevant in choosing what to buy and what not to buy. They would no 
longer be in a position to decide on the basis of the opinion which 
they themselves have formed about the seller's appraisal of his 
products; they would be forced to act on the recommendation of 
other people..~t is not unlikely that these mentors would save them 
some mistakes. But the individual consumers would be under the 
tutelage of guardians. If advertising is not restricted, the consumers 
are by and large in the position of a jury which learns about the case 
by hearing the witnesses and examining directly all other means of 
evidence. If advertising is restricted, they are in the position of a jury 
to whom an officer reports about the result of his own examination of 
evidence. 

It is a widespread fallacy that skillful advertising can talk the con- 
sumers into buying everything that the advertiser wants them to buy. 
The consumer is, according to this legend, simply defenseless against 
"high-pressure" advertising. If this were true, success or failure in 
business would depend on the mode of advertising only. However, 
nobody believes that any kind of advertising would have succeeded 
in making the candlemakers hold the field against the electric bulb, 
the horsedrivers against the motorcars, the goose quill against the 
steeI pen and later against the fountain pen. But whoever admits this 


Human Action 
implies that the quality of the commodity advertised is instrumental 
in bringing about the success of an advertising campaign. Then there 
is no reason to maintain that advertising is a method of cheating the 
gullible public. 
It is certainly possible for an advertiser to induce a man to try an 
article which he would not have bought if he had known its qualities 
beforehand. But as long as advertising is free to a11 competing firms, 
the article which is better from the point of view of the consumers' 
appetites will finalIy outstrip the less appropriate article, whatever 
methods of advertising may be applied. The tricks and artifices of 
advertising are available to the seller of the better product no less 
than to the seller of the poorer product. But only the former enjoys 
the advantage derivcd from the better quality of his product. 
The efiects of advertising of commodities are determined by the 
fact that as a rule the buyer is in a position to form a correct opinion 
about the usefulness of an article bought. The housewife who has 
tried a particular brand of soap or canned food learns from experience 
whether it is good for her to buy and consume that product in thc 
future too. Therefore advertising pays the advertiser only if the 
examination of the first sample bought does not result in the con- 
sumer's refusal to buy more of it. It is agreed among businessmen that 
it does not pay to advertise products other than good ones. 
Entirely different are conditions in those fieIds in which experience 
cannot teach us anything. The statements of religious, mctaphysical, 
and political propaganda can be neither verified nor falsified by ex- 
perience. With regard to the life beyond and the absolute, any ex- 
perience is denied to men living in this world. In political matters 
experience is always the experience of complex phenomena which is 
opcn to different *interpretations; the onIy yardstick which can be 
applied to political doctrines is aprioristic reasoning. Thus political 
propaganda and business propaganda are essentially different things, 
although they often resort to the same technical methods. 
There are many evils for which contemporary technology and 
therapeutics have no remedy. There are incurable diseases and there 
are irreparable personal defects. It is a sad fact that some people try 
to exploit their fellow men's plight by offering them patent medicines. 
Such quackeries do not make old people young and ugly girls pretty. 
They only raise hopes. It would not impair the operation of the mar- 
ket if the authorities were to prevent such advertising, the truth of 
which cannot be evidenced by the methods of the experimental 
natural sciences. But whoever is ready to grant to the government this 
power would be inconsistent if he objected to the demand to submit 


The Market 319 

the statements of churches and sects to the same examination. Free- 
dom is indivisible, As soon as one starts to restrict it, one enters upon 
a decline on which it is difficult to stop. If one assigns to the govern- 
ment the task of making truth prevail in the advertising of perfumes 
and tooth paste, one cannot contest it the right to look after truth 
in the more important matters of religion, philosophy, and social 
ideology. 

The idea that business propaganda can force the consumers to sub- 
mit to the will of the advertisers is spurious. Advertising can never 
succeed in supplanting better or cheaper goods available and offered 
for sale. 

The costs incurred by advertising are, from the point of view of 
the advertiser, a part of the total bill of production costs. A business-
man expends money for advertising if and as far as he expects that the 
increase in sales resulting will increase the total net proceeds. In this 
regard thcre is no difference between the costs of advcrtising and 
all other costs of production. An attempt has been made to distinguish 
between production costs and sales costs. An increase in production 
costs, it has been said, increases supply, while an increase in sales 
costs (advertising costs included) increases demand.24 This is a mis- 
take. All costs of production are expended with the intention of in- 
creasing demand. If the manufacturer of candy employs a better 
raw material, he aims at an increase in demand in the same way as he 
does in making the wrappings more attractive and his stores more 
inviting and in spending more for advertisements. In increasing pro- 
duction costs per unit of the product the idea is always to increase de- 
mand. If a businessman wants to increase supply, he must increase 
the total cost of production, which often results in lowering produc- 
tion costs per unit. 

14. The "Volkswirtschaft" 
The market economy as such does not respect political frontiers. 
Its field is the world. 

The term Volkmirtschaft was long applied by the German cham-
pions of government omnipotence. Only much later did the British 
and the French begin to speak of the "British economy" and "l'e'co-
nomie fran~aise" as distinct from the economies of other nations. But 
neither the English nor the French language produced an equivalent 
of the term Volkswirtschaft. With the modern trend toward nationa! 

24. Cf. Chamberlm, The Theory of Monopolistic Competition (Cambridge, 
Mass., r935), pp. 123 ff. 

Human Action 
planning and national autarky, the doctrine involved in this German 
word became popular everywhere. Nonetheless, only the German 
language is able to express in one word all the ideas implied. 
The Volkswirtschaft is a sovereign nation's total complex of eco- 
nomic activities directed and controlled by the government. It is 
socialism realized within the political frontiers of each nation. In 
employing this term people are fully aware of the fact that real condi- 
tions differ from the state of affairs which they deem the only ade- 
quate and desirable state. But they judge everything that happens in 
the market economy from the point of view of their ideal. They as- 
sume that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of 
the Volkswirtschaft and those of the selfish individuals eager to seek 
profit. They do not hesitate to assign priority to the interests of the 
Volkswirtschaft over those of the individuals. The righteous citizen 
should always place the volX'swi.~tschaftlicheinterests above his own 
selfish interests. He should act of his own accord as if he were an 
officer of the government executing its orders. Gemeinnutz geht vor 
Eigennutz (the welfare of the nation takes precedence over the 
selfishness of the individuals) was the fundamental principle of Nazi 
economic management. But as people are too dull and too vicious to 
comply with this rule, it is the task of government to enforce it. The 
German princes of the seventeenth and eighteenth century, foremost 
among them the HohenzolIern Electors of Brandenburg and Kings of 
Prussia, were fully equal to this task. In the nineteenth century, even 
in Germany the liberal ideologies imported from the West superseded 
the weI1-tried and natural policies of nationalism and socialism. How- 
ever, Bismarck's and his successors' Sozialpolitik and finally Nazism 
restored them. 
The interests of a Volkswirtschaft are seen as implacably opposed 
not only to those of the individuals, but no less to those of the 
Volkswirtschaft of any foreign nation. The most desirable state of 
a Volkswirtschaft is complete economic self-sufficiency. A nation 
which depends on any imports from abroad lacks economic inde- 
pendence; its sovereignty is only a sham. Therefore a nation which 
cannot produce at home all that it needs is bound to conquer all the 
territories required. To be really sovereign and independent a nation 
must have T.ebensraum, i.e., a territory so large and rich in natural 
resources that it can live in autarky at a standard no lower than that 
of any other nation. 
Thus the idea of the Volkswirtschaft is the most radical denial of 
all the principles of the market economy. It was this idea that guided, 
more or less, the economic policies of all nations in the last decades. 


The Market 321 

It was the pursuit of this idea that brought about the terrific wars of 
our century and will probably kindle still more pernicious wars in 
the future. 

From the early beginnings of human history the two opposite 
principles of the market economy and of the Volltswirtschaft fought 
each other. Government, i.e., a social apparatus of coercion and com- 
pulsion, is a necessary requisite of peaceful cooperation. The marlcet 
economy cannot do without a police power safeguarding its smooth 
functioning by the threat or the application of violence against peace- 
breakers. But the indispensable administrators and thcir armed satcl- 
lites are always tempted to use their arms for the establishment of 
their own totalitarian rule. For ambitious kings and generalissimos 
the very existence of a sphere of individuals' lives not subject to regi- 
mentation is a challenge. Princes, governors, and generals are never 
spontaneously liberal. They becomc liberal only when forced to by 
the citizens. 

The problems raised by the plans of the socialists and thc interven- 
tionists will be dealt with in later parts of this book. IJere we have 
only to answer the question of whether or not any of the essential 
features of the Volkswirtschaft arc compatible with the rnarlcet 
economy. For the champions of the idea of the Volkswirtschaft do 
not consider their scheme merely as a pattern for the establishment of 
a future social order. They declare emphatically that even under the 
system of the market economy, which, or course, in their eyes is a 
debased and vicious product of policies contrary to human nature, 
the Volkswirtschaften of the various nations are integrated units 
whose interests are irreconcilably opposed to those of all other na- 
tions' Volkswirtschaften. What separates one Volkswirtschaft from 
all the others is not, as the economists would have us believe, merely 
political institutions. It is not the trade and migration barriers es-
tablished by government interference with business and the dif- 
fercnces in legislation and in the protection granted to the individuals 

I.--"y -1.

Llle 

UUL~and tribiiiials that triilg atuilt the disiiirictio~i tctwee~i 
domestic trade and foreign trade. This diversity is, on the contrary, 
the necessary outcome of the very nature of things, of an inextricable 
factor; it cannot be removed by any ideology and produces its effects 
whether the laws and the administrators and judges are prepared to 
take notice of it or not. The Volkswirtschaft is a nature-given reality, 
while the world-embracing ecumenic society of men, the world econ- 
omy (?Yeltwirtschaft), is only an imaginary phantom of a spurious 
doctrine, a plan devised for the destruction of civilization. 

The truth is that individuals in their acting, in thcir capacity as 


Human Action 

producers and consumers, as sellers and buyers, do not make any 
distinction as between the domestic market and the foreign market. 
They make a distinction as between local trade and trading with more 
distant places as far as the costs of transportation play a role. If gov- 
ernment interference, such as tariffs, render international transactions 
more expensive, they take this fact into account in the same way in 
which they pay regard to shipping costs. A tariff on caviar has no 
effect other than would a rise in the cost of transportation. A rigid 
prohibition of the importation of caviar produces a state of affairs 
no different from that which would prevail if caviar could not stand 
shipping without an essential deterioration in its quality. 

There has never been in the history of the West such a thing as 
regional or national autarky. There was, as we may admit, a period in 
which the division of labor did not go beyond the members of a family 
household. There was autarky of families and tribes which did not 
practice interpersonal exchange. But as soon as interpersonal exchange 
emerged, it crossed the boundaries of the political communities. 
Barter between the inhabitants of regions more remote from one an- 
other, between the members of various tribes, villages, and political 
communities preceded the practice of barter between neighbors. 
What people wanted first to acquire by barter and trade were things 
they could not produce themselves out of their own resources. Salt, 
other minerals and metals the deposits of which are unequally distrib- 
uted over the earth's surface, cereals which one could not grow on the 
domestic soil, and artifacts which only the inhabitants of some regions 
were able to manufacture, were the first objects of trade. Trade 
started as foreign trade. Only later did domestic exchange develop 
between neighbors. The first holes that opened the closed household 
economy to interpersonal exchange were made by the products of 
distant regions. No consumer cared on his own account whether the 
salt and the metals he bought were of "domestic" or of "foreign" 
provenance. If it had been otherwise, the governments would not 
have had any reason to interfere by means of tariffs and other barriers 
to foreign trade. 

But even if a government succeeds in making the barriers separating 
its domestic market from foreign markets insurmountable and thus 
establishes perfect national autarky, it does not create a Volkswirt- 
schaft. A market economy which is perfectly autarkic remains for 
all that a market economy; it forms a closed and isolated catallactic 
system. The fact that its citizens miss the advantages which they could 
derive from the international division of labor is simply a datum of 
their economic conditions. Only if such an isolated country goes out- 


The Market 323 

right socialist, does it convert its market economy into a Volkswirt- 
schaft. 

Fascinated by the propaganda of Neo-Mercantilism, people apply 
idioms which are in contrast to the principIes they take as guides in 
their acting and to all the characteristics of the social order in which 
they are living. Long ago the British began to call plants and farms 
located in Great Britain, and even those located in the Dominions, 
in the East Indies, and in the colonies, "ours." But if a ~nandid not 
just want to make a show of his patriotic zeal and to i~npress other 
people, he was not prepared to pay a higher price for the products 
of his "own" plants than for those of the "foreign" plants. Even if he 
had behaved in this way, the designation of the plants located within 
the poIitical boundaries of his nation as "ours" would not be adequate. 
In what sense could a Londoner, before the nationalization, call coal- 
mines Iocated in England which he did not own "our" mines and those 
of the Ruhr "foreign" mines? Whether he bought "British" coal or 
"German" coal, he always had to pay the full market price. It is not 
"Americayy that buys champagne from "France." It is always an in- 
dividual American who buys it from an individual Frenchman. 

As far as there is still some room left for the actions of individuals, 
as far as there is private ownership and exchange of goods and services 
between individuals, there is no Volkswirtschaft. Only if full govern- 
ment control is substituted for the choices of individuals does the 
Volkswirtschaft emerge as a real entity. 


XVI. PRICES 
I. The Pricing Process 
IN an occasional act of barter in which men who ordinarily do not 

resort to trading with other people exchange goods ordinarily not 
negotiated, the ratio of exchange is determined only within broad 
margins. CatalIactics, the theory of exchange ratios and prices, can- 
not determine at what point within these margins the concrete ratio 
will bc established. All that it can assert with rcgard to such exchanges 
is that they can be effectcd only if cach party values what hc re- 
ceives more highly than what he gives away. 

The recurrence of individual acts of exchange generates the mar- 
ket step by step with the evoIution of the division of labor within 
a society based on private property. As it becomes a rulc to produce 
for other people's consumption, the lnernbers of society must sell and 
buy. The multiplication of the acts of exchange and the incrcase in 
the number of people offering or asking for the same commodities 
narrow the margins betwcen the valuations of the parties. Indirect 
exchange and its perfection through the use of money divide the 
transactions into two different parts: sale and purchase.'~hat in the 
eyes of orlc party is a sale, is far thc other party n purchase. The 
divisibility of money, unlimited for all practical purposes, maltes it 
possible to determine thc exchange ratios with nicety. The exchange 
ratios are now as a rule money priccs. They are determined between 
extrcmcly narrow margins: tllc valuations on the one hand of the 
marginal buyer and those of the marginal offerer who abstains from 
selling, and -the valuations on the other hand of the marginal seller 
and those of the marginal potential buyer who abstains from buy- 
ing. 

The concatenation of the market is an outcome of the activities of 
entrcprcneurs, promoters, speculators, and dealers in futures and in 
arbitrage. It has been asscrted that catallactics is based on the assump- 
tion-contrary-to reality-that all parties are provided with perfect 
knowledge concerning the market data and are thercfore in a posi- 
tion to take best advantage of the most favorable opportunities for 


Prices 

buying and selling. It is true that some economists really beIieved 
that such an assumption is implied in the theory of prices. These 
authors not only failed to realize in what respects a world peopled 
with men perfectly equal in knowledge and foresight would differ 
from the real world which all economists wanted to interpret in 
developing their theories; they also erred in being unaware of the 
fact that they themselves did not resort to such an assumption in 
their own treatment of prices. 

In an economic system in which every actor is in a position to 
recognize correctly the market situation with the same degree of 
insight, the adjustment of prices to every change in the data would 
be achieved at one stroke. It is impossible to imagine such uniformity 
in the correct cognition and appraisal of changes in data cxccpt by 
the intercession of supcrhurnan agencies. We would have to assume 
that every man is approached by an angcl informing him of the 
change in data which has occurred and advising him how to adjust 
his own conduct in the most adequate way to this change. Certainly 
the market that catallactics deals with is filled with people who are to 
different degrees aware of the changes in data and who, even if they 
have the same information, appraise it differently. The operation of 
the market reflects the fact that changes in the data are first per- 
ceived only by a few peoplc and that different men draw different 
conclusions in appraising their effects. The more enterprising and 
brighter individuals take the lead, others follow later. The shrewder 
individuals appreciate conditions more correctly than the less in- 
telligent and therefore succeed better in their actions. Economists 
must never disregard in their reasoning the fact that the innate and 
acquired inequality of men diffcrentiates their adjustment to the 
conditions of their environment. 

The driving force of the market process is provided neither by 
the consumers nor by the owners of the means of production-land, 
capital goods, and labor-but by the promoting and speculating entre- 
preneurs. These are people intent upon profiting by taking advantage 
of differences in prices. Quicker of apprehension and farther-sighted 
than other men, they look around for sources of profit. They buy 
where and when they deem prices too low, and they sell where and 
when they deem prices too high. They approach the owners of the 
factors of production, and their competition sends the prices of these 
factors up to the limit corresponding to their anticipation of the 
future prices of the products. They approach the consumers, and 
their competition forces prices of consumers' goods down to the 
point at which the whole supply can be sold. Profit-seeking specula- 


Hu~nanAction 

tion is the driving force of the market as it is the driving force of 
production. 

On the market agitation never stops. The imaginary construction of 
an evenly rotating economy has no counterpart in reality. There can 
never emerge a state of affairs in which the sum of the prices of the 
complementary factors of production, due allowance being made for 
time preference, equals the prices of the products and no further 
changes are to be expected. There are always profits to be earned by 
somebody. The speculators are always enticed by the expectation of 
profit. 

The imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy is a 
mental tool for comprehension of entrepreneurial profit and loss. It 
is, to be sure, not a design for comprehension of the pricing process. 
The final prices corresponding to this imaginary conception are by 
no tncans identical with the market prices. The activities of the entre- 
preneurs or of any other actors on the economic scene are not guided 
by consideration of any such things as equilibrium prices and the 
evenly rotating economy. The entrepreneurs take into account antici- 
pated future prices, not final prices or equilibrium prices. They dis- 
cover discrepancies between the height of the prices of the comple- 
mentary factors of production and the anticipated future prices of 
the products, and they are intent upon taking advantage of such 
discrepancies. These endeavors of the entrepreneurs would finally 
result in the emergence of the evenly rotating economy if no further 
changes in the data were to appear. 

The operation of the entrepreneurs brings about a tendency to- 

ward an equalization of prices for the same goods in all subdivisions 

of the market, due aIlowance being made for the cost of transporta- 

tion and the time absorbed by it. Diffcrences in prices which are not 

merely transitory and bound to be wiped out by entrepreneurial 

action are always the outcome of particular obstacles obstructing the 

inherent tendency toward equalization. Some check prevents profit- 

seeking business from interfering. An observer not sufficiently famil- 

iar with actual commercial conditions is often at a loss to rccognize 

the institutional barriers hindering such equalization. But the mer- 

chants concerned always know what makes it impossible for them to 

take advantage of such differences. 

Statisticians treat this problem too lightly. When they have dis- 

covered differences in the wholesale price of a commodity between 

two cities or countries, not entirely accounted for by the cost of 

transportation, tariffs, and excise duties, they acquiesce in asserting 

that the purchasing power of money and the "level" of prices are 


di8erent.l On the basis of such statements people draft programs to 
remove these differences by monetary measures. However, the root 
cause of these differences cannot lie in monetary conditions. If prices 
in both countries are quoted in terms of the same kind of money, 
it is necessary to answer the question as to what prevents business- 
men from embarking upon dealings which are bound to make price 
differences disappear. Things are essentially the same if the prices are 
expresscd in terms of different kinds of money. For the mutual ex- 
change ratio between various kinds of money tends toward a point 
at which there is no further margin left to profitable expIoitation of 
differences in commodity prices. Whenever differences in commod- 
ity prices between various places pcrsist, it is a task for economic his- 
tory and descriptive economics to establish what institutional barriers 
hinder thc execution of transactions which must result in thc equaliza- 
tion of prices. 

All the prices we know arc past prices. They are facts of economic 
history. In speaking of present prices we imply that the prices of 
thc immediate future wiIl not differ from those of the immediate past. 
However, all that is asserted with regard to future prices is merely 
an outcome of the understanding of future events. 

The experience of economic history never tells us morc than that 
at a definite date and definite place two parties A and I3 traded a 
definite quantity of the commodity a against a definite number of 
units of the money p. In speaking of such acts of buying and selling 
as the market price of a, we are guided by a thcorctical insight, de- 
duced from an aprioristic starting point. This is the insight that, in 
the absence of particular factors making for price differences, the 
prices paid at the same time and the same place for equal quantities 
of the same commodity tend toward equalization, viz., a final price. 
But the actual market prices never reach this final state. The various 
market prices about which we can get information were determined 
under different conditions. It is impermissible to confuse averages 
computed from them with the final prices. 

Only with regard to fungible commodities negotiated on organized 
stock or commodity exchanges is it permissible, in comparing prices, 
to assume that they refer to the same quality. Apart from such prices 
negotiated in exchanges and from prices of commodities the homo- 
geneity of which can be precisely established by technological anal- 

I. Sometimes the difference in price as established by price statistics is apparent 
only. The price quotations may refer to various qualities of the article concerned. 
Or they may, complying with the local usages of commerce, mean different 
things. They may, for instance, include or not include packing charges; they 
may refer to cash payment or to payment at a later date; and so on. 

Hman Action 

ysis, it is a serious bIunder to disregard differences in the quality 
of the commodity in question. Even in the wholesale tradi: of raw 
textiles the diversity of the articles plays the main role. A comparison 
of prices of consumers' goods is mainly misleading on account of the 
difference in quality. The quantity traded in one transaction too is 
relevant in the determination of the price paid per unit. Shares of a 
corporation sold in one large lot bring a different price than those sold 
in several small lots. 

It is necessary to emphasize these facts again and again because it 
is customary nowadays to play off the statistical elaboration of price 
data against the theory of prices. However, the statistics of prices 
is altogether questionable. Its foundations are precarious because cir- 
cumstances for the most part do not permit the comparison of the 
various data, their linking together in series, and the computation of 
averages. Full of zeaI to embark upon mathematical operations, the 
statisticians yield to the temptation of disregarding the incompa- 
rability of the data available. The information that a certain firm sold 
at a definite date a definite type of shoes for six dollars a pair relates 
a fact of economic history. A study of the behavior of shoe prices 
from 1923 to 1939 is conjectural, however sophisticated the methods 
applied may be. 

Catallactics shows that entrepreneurial activities tend toward an 
abolition of price differences not caused by the costs of transporta- 
tion and trade barriers. No experience has ever contradicted this 
theorem. The results obtained by an arbitrary identification of un- 
equal things are irrelevant. 

2. Valuation and Appraisement 
The ultimate source of the determination of prices is the value 
judgments of the consumers. Prices are the outcome of the valuation 
preferring LI to 6. They are social phenomena as they are brought 
about by thc interplay of the valuations of all individuals participating 
in the operation of the market. Each individual, in buying or not 
buying and in selling or not selling, contributes his share to the forma- 
tion of the market prices. But the larger the market is, the smaller is 
the weight of each individual's contribution. Thus the structure of 
market prices appears to the individual as a datum to which he must 
adjust his own conduct. 

The valuations which result in determination of definite prices are 
different. Each party attaches a higher value to the good he receives 
than to that he gives away. The exchange ratio, the price, is not 


Przces 3 29 

the product of an equality of valuation, but, on the contrary, the 
product of a discrepancy in valuation. 

Appraisement must be clearly distinguished from valuation. Ap- 
praisement in no way depends upon the subjective valuation of the 
man who appraises. He is not intent upon establishing the subjective 
use-value of the good concerned, but upon anticipating the prices 
which the market will determine. Valuation is a value judgment ex-
pressive of a difference in value. Appraisement is the anticipation of 
an expected fact. It aims at establishing what prices will be paid on 
the market for a particular commodity or what amount of money 

ill be required for the purchase of a definite cormrnodity. 

Valuation and appraisement arc, however, closely connected. The 
valuations of an autarkic husbandman directly compare the weight 
he attaches to different means for the removal of uneasiness. The valua- 
tions of a man buying and selling on the market must not disregard 
the structure of market prices; they depend upon appraisement. In 
order to know the meaning of a price one must know the purchasing 
power of the amount of moncy concerned. It is necessary by and 
large to be familiar with the prices of those goods which one would 
like to acquire and to form on the ground of such Itnowledge an 
opinion a1)ont their future prices. If an individual speaks of the costs 
incurred by the purchase of some goods already acquired or to be 
incurred by the purchase of goods he plans to acquire, he expresses 
these costs in term of moncy. But this amount of money represents 
in his eyes the degree of satisfaction he could obtain by employing it 
for the acquisition of other goods. The valuation ~nakes a detour, 
it goes via the appraisement of the structure of market prices; but 
it always aims finally at the comparison of alternative modes for the 
removal of felt uneasiness. 

It isultimately always the subjective value judgments of individuals 
that determine the formation of prices. CatalIactics in conceiving the 
pricing process necessarily reverts to the fundamental category of 
action, the preference given to a over b. In view of popular errors it is 
expedient to emphasize that catallactics deals with the real prices as 
they are paid in definite transactions and not with imaginary prices. 
The concept of final prices is merely a mental tool for the grasp of a 
particular problem, the emergence of entrepreneurial profit and loss. 
The concept of a "just" or "fair" price is devoid of any scientific 
meaning; it is a disguise for wishes, a striving for a state of affairs 
different from reality. Market prices are entirely determined by the 
value judgments of men as they really act. 

If one says that prices tend toward a point at which total demand is 


330 Human Action 
equal to total supply, one resorts to another mode of expressing the 
same concatenation of phenomena. Demand and supply are the out- 
come of the conduct of those buying and selling. If, other things be- 
ing equal, supply increases, prices must drop. At the previous price 
all those ready to pay this price could buy the quantity they wanted 
to buy. If the supply increases, they must buy larger quantities or 
other people who did not buy before must become interested in 
buying. 'This can only be attained at a lower price. 
It is possible to visualize this interaction by drawing two curves, 
the demand curve and the supply curve, whose intersection shows 
the price. It is no less possibIe to express it in mathematical symbols. 
But it is necessary to comprehend that such pictorial or mathematical 
modes of representation do not affect the essence of our interpreta- 
tion and that they do not add a whit to our insight. Furthermore it 
is important to realize that we do not have any knowledge or experi- 
ence concerning the shape of such curves. Always, what we know 
is only market prices-that is, not the curves but only a point which 
we interpret as the intersection of two hypothetical curves. The draw- 

ing of such curves may prove expedient in visualizing the problems 
for undergraduates. For the real tasks of catallactics they are mere 
byplay. 

3. The Prices of the Goods of Higher Orders 
The market process is coherent and indivisible. It is an indissoluble 
intertwinement of actions and reactions, of moves and countermoves. 
But the insufficiency of our mentaI abilities enjoins upon us the neces- 
sity of dividing it into parts and analyzing each of these parts sepa- 
rately. In resorting to such artificial cleavages we must never forget 
that the seemingly autonomous existence of these parts is an imaginary 
makeshift of our minds. They are only parts, that is, they cannot even 
be thought of as existing outside the structure of which they are 
parts. 

The prices of the goods of higher orders are ultimately determined 
by the prices of the goods of the first or lowest order, that is, the 
consumers' goods. As a consequence of this dependence they are 
ultimately determined by the subjective vahations of all members of 
the market society. It is, however, important to realize that we are 
faced with a connection of prices, not with a connection of valuations. 
The prices of the complementary factors of production are condi- 
tioned by the prices of the consumers' goods. The factors of produc- 
tion are appraised with regard to the prices of the products, and from 


Prices 331 

this appraisement their prices emerge. Not the valuations but the 
appraisements are transferred from the goods of the first order to 
those of higher orders. The prices of the consumers' goods engender 
the actions resulting in the determination of the prices of the factors 
of production. These prices are primarily connected only with the 
prices of the consumers' goods. With the valuations of the individuals 
they are only indirectly connected, viz., through the intermediary of 
thewprices03 the consumers' goods, the products of their joint em- 
ployment. 

The tasks incumbent upon the theory of the prices of factors of 
production are to be solved by the same methods which are employed 
for treatment of the prices of consumers' goods. We conceive the 
operation of the market of consumers' goods in a twofold way. We 
think on the one hand of a state of affairs which leads to acts of ex- 
change; the situation is such that the uneasiness of various individuals 
can be removed to some extent because various peopIe value the same 
goods in a different way. On the other hand we think of a situation 
in which no further acts of exchange can happen because no actor 
expects any further improvement of his satisfaction by further acts 
of exchange. We proceed in the same way in comprehending the 
formation of the prices of factors of production. The operation of 
this market is actuated and kept in motion by the exertion of the 
promoting entrepreneurs, eager to profit from differences in the 
market prices of the factors of production and the expected prices of 
the products. The operation of this market would stop if a situation 
were ever to emerge in which the sum of the prices of the comple- 
mentary factors of production-but for interest-equaled the prices 
of the products and nobody believed that further price changes were 
to be expected. Thus wc have described the process adequately and 
completely by pointing out, positively, what actuates it and, nega- 
tively, what would suspend its motion. The main importance is to be 
attached to the positive description. The negative description re-
sulting in the imaginary constructions of the final price and the evenly 
rotating economy is merely auxiliary. For the task is not the treat- 
ment of imaginaEy concepts, which never appear in Iife and action, 
but the treatment of the market prices at which the goods of higher 
orders are really bought and sold. 

This method we owe to Gossen, Carl Mcnger, and Biihm-Bawerk. 
Its main merit is that it implies the cognition that we are faced with 
a phenomenon of price determination inextricably linked with the 
market process. It distinguishes between two things: (a) the direct 
valuation of the factors of production which attaches the value of 


Human Action 

the product to the total complex of the cotnplementary factors of 
production. and (6) the prices of the single factors of production 
which are formed on the market as rhc resultant of the concurring 
actions of competing highest bidders. Valuation as it can be practiced 
by an isolated actor (Robinson Crusoe or a socialist board of pro- 
diction management) can never result in a determination of such 
a thing as quotas of value. Valuation can only arrange goods in scales 
of prefcrence. It can never attach to a good something that could be 
called a quantity or magnitude of value. It would be absurd to speak 
of a sum of valuations or values. It is permissible to declare that, due 
allowance being made for time preference, the value attached to a 
product is equal to the value of the total complex of complementary 
factors of production. But it would be nonsensical to assert that the 
value attached to a product is equal to the "sum" of the values attached 
to the various complementary factors of production. One cannot 
add up values or valuations. One can add up prices expressed in terms 
of money, but not scales of preference. One cannot divide values 
or single out quotas of them. A value judgment never consists in any- 
thing other than preferring a to h. 

The process of value imputation does not result in derivation of 
the value of the singlc productive agents from the value of their joint 
product. It does not bring about results which could serve as elements 
of economic calculation. It is onlv the markct that, in establishing 
prices for each factor of productidn, creates the conditions required 
for economic calculation. Economic calculation always deals with 
prices, never with values. 

The market determines prices of factors of production in the same 
way in which it determines prices of consumers' goods. The market 
process is an interaction of mcn deliberately striving after the best 
possible ren~oval of dissatisfaction. It is impbssible to think away or 
to eliminate from the market proccss the men actuating its operation. 
One cannot deal with the rnarkct of consumers' goods and disregard 
the actions of the consumers. One cannot deal with the market of the 
goods of higher orders while disregarding the actions of the entre- 
preneurs and the fact that the use of money is essential in their trans- 
actions. There is nothing automatic or mechanical in the operation 
of the market. The entrepreneurs, eager to earn profits, appear as 
bidders at an auction, as it were, in which the owners of the factors 
of production put up for sale land, capital goods, and labor. The 
entrepreneurs are eager to outdo one another by bidding higher 
prices than thcir rivals. Their offers are limited on the one hand by 
their anticipation of future prices of the products and on the other 


Prices 

hand by the necessity to snatch the factors of production away from 
the hands of other entrepreneurs competing with thcm. 

The entrepreneur is the agency that prevcnts the persistence of a 
state of production unsuitable to fill the most urgent wants of the 
consumers in the cheapest way. All people are anxious for the best 
possible satisfaction of their wants and arc in this sense striving after 
the highest profit they can reap. The mentality of the promoters, 
speculators, and entrepreneurs is not different from that of their fel- 
low men. They are merely superior to thc masses in mental power 
and energy. They are the leaders on the way toward material progress. 
They are the first to understand that there is a discrepancy between 
what is done and what could be done. They guess what the consumers 
would like to have and arc intent upon providing them with these 
things. In the pursuit of such plans they bid higher prices for some 
factors of production and lower the prices of other factors of pro- 
duction by restricting their demand for them. In supplying the market 
with those consumers' goods in the sale of which the highest profits 
can be earned, they create a tendcncy toward a fall in their prices. In 
restricting the output of those consumers' goods the production of 
which does not offer chances for reaping profit, they bring about a 
tendency toward a rise in their prices. All these transformations go 
on ceaselessly and could stop only if the unrealizable conditions of the 
evenly rotating economy and of static equilibrium were to be at- 
tained. 

In drafting their plans the entrepreneurs look first at the prices of 
the immediate past which are mistakenly called presefzt prices. Of 
course, the entrepreneurs never make these prices enter into their 
calculations without paying regard to anticipated changes. The prices 
of the immediate past are for them only the starting point of delibera- 
tions Ieading to forecasts of future prices. The prices of the past do not 
influence the determination of future prices. It is, on the contrary, the 
anticipation of future prices of the products that determines the state 
of prices of the complementary factors of production. The deter- 
mination of prices has, as far as the mutual exchange ratios between 
various commodities are concerned,"~ direct causal relation what- 
ever with the prices of the past. The allocation of the nonconvertible 
factors of production among the various branches of production 
and the amount of capital goods availabIe for future production are

the vendible commodities and services. Cf. below, pp. 407-408.

499-505. 


Humam Action 

historical magnitudes; in this regard the past is instrumental in shaping 
the course of future production and in affecting the prices of the 
future. But directly the prices of the factors of production are deter- 
mined exclusively by the anticipation of future prices of the products. 
The fact that yesterday people valued and appraised commodities in 
a different way is irrelevant. The consumers do not care about the 
investments made with regard to past market conditions and do not 
bother about the vested interests of entrepreneurs, capitalists, land- 
owners, and workers, who may be hurt by changes in the structure 
of prices. Such sentiments play no role in the formation of prices. (It 
is precisely the fact that the market does not respect vested interests 
that makes the people concerned ask for government interference.) 
Thc prices of the past are for the entrepreneur, the shaper of future 
production, merely a mental tool. The entrepreneurs do not con- 
struct afresh every day a radically new structure of prices or allocate 
anew the factors of production to the various branches of industry. 
They merely transform what the past has transmitted in better adapt- 
ing it to the altered conditions. How much of the previous conditions 
they preserve and how much they change depends on the extent to 
which the data have changed. 

The cconomic process is a continuous interplay of production and 
consumption. Today's activities are linked with those of the past 
through the technological knowledge at hand, the amount and the 
quality of the capital goods available, and the distribution of the 
ownership of these goods among various individuals. They are linked 
with the future through the very essence of human action; action is 
always directed toward the improvement of future conditions. In 
order to see his way in the unknown and uncertain future man has 
within his reach only two aids: experience of past events and his 
faculty of understanding. Knowledge about past prices is a part of 
this experience and at the same time the starting point of understand- 
ing-the future. 

If the memory of all prices of the past were to fade away, the 
pricing process would become more troublesome, but not impossible 
as far as the mutual exchange ratios between various commodities are 
concerned. It would be harder for the entrepreneurs to adjust pro- 
duction to the demand of the public, but it could be done nonetheless. 
It would be necessary for them to assemble anew all the data they 
need as the basis of their operations. They would not avoid mistakes 
which they now evade on account of experience at their disposal. 
Price fluctuations would be more violent at the beginning, factors of 
production would be wasted, want-satisfaction would be impaired. 


But finally, having paid dearly, people would again have acquired the 
experience needed for a smooth working of the market process. 

The essential fact is that it is the competition of profit-seeking entre- 
preneurs that docs not tolerate the preservation of false prices of the 
factors of production. The activities of the entrepreneurs are the 
element that would bring about the unrealizable state of the evenly 
rotating cconomy if no further changes werc to occur. In the world- 
embracing public sale called the market they arc the bidders for the 
factors of production. In bidding, they arc the mandataries of the con- 
sumers, as it werc. Each entrepreneur represents a different aspect 
of the consumers' wants, either a different commodity or another way 
of producing the same commodity. The competition among the entre- 
preneurs is ultimately a competition among the various possibilities 
open to men to remove their uneasiness as far as possible by the 
acquisition of consumers' goods. The decisions of the consumers to 
tmy one commodity and to postpone buying another determine the 
prices of factors of production required for manufacturing these 
commodities. The competition between the entrepreneurs reflects 
the prices of consumers' goods in the formation of the prices of the 
factors of production. It reflects in the external world the conflict 
which the inexorable scarcity of the factors of production brings 
about in the soul of each individual. It makes effective the subsumed 
decisions of the consumers as to what purpose the nonspecific factors 
should be used for and to what extent the spccific factors of produc- 
tion should be used. 

The pricing process is a social process. It is consummated by an 

interaction of all members of the society. All collaborate and cooper- 

ate, each in the particuIar role he has chosen for himself in the 

framework of the division of labor. Competing in cooperation and 

coopcrating in competition all people are instrumental in bringing 

about the result, viz., the price structure of the market, the allocation 

of the factors of production to the various lines of want-satisfaction, 

and the determination of the share of each individual. These three 

events are not three different matters. They are only different aspects 

of one indivisible phenomenon which our analytical scrutiny separates 

into three parts. In the market process they arc accomplished uno actu. 

Only people prepossessed by sociaIist leanings who cannot free them- 

selves from longing glances at socialist methods speak of three differ- 

ent processes in dealing with the market phenomena: thc detcrmina- 

tion of prices, the direction of productive efforts, and distribution.

A Limitation on the Pricing of Factors of Production 

The process which makes the prices of the factors of production spring 
from the prices of products can achieve its results only if, of the comple- 
mentary factors not replaceable by substitutes, not more than one is of 
absolutely specific character, that is, is not suitable for any other employ- 
ment. If the production of a product requires two or more absolutely 
specific factors, only a cumulative price can be assigned to them. If all 
factors of production were absolutely specific, the pricing process would 
not achieve more than such cumulative prices. It would accomplish noth- 
ing more than statements like this: as combining 3 a and 5 b produces one 
unit of p, 3 a and 5 b together are equal to I p and the final price of 3 a 15 b 
is--due allowance being made for time preference-equal to the final price 
of I p. As entrepreneurs who want to use a and b for purposes other than 
the production of p do not bid for them, a more detailed price dctermina- 
tion is impossible. Only if a demand emerges for a (or for b) on the part of 
entrepreneurs who want to employ a (or b) for other purposes, does com- 
petition between them and the entrepreneurs planning the production of p 
arise and a price for a (or for b) comes into existence, the height of which 
determines also the price of b (or a). 

A world in which all the factors of production are absolutely specific 
could manage its affairs with such cumulative prices. In such a world there 
would not exist the problem of how to allocate the means of production to 
various branches of want-satisfaction. In our real world things are different. 
There are many scarce means of production which can be employed for 
various tasks. There the economic problem is to employ these factors in 
such a way that no unit of them should be used for the satisfaction of a less 
urgent need if this employment prevents the satisfaction of a more urgent 
need. It is this that the market solves in determining the prices of the factors 
of production. The social service rendered by this solution is not in the 
least impaired by the fact that for factors which can be employed only 
cumuIativcly no other than cumulative prices are determined. 

Factors of production which can be used in the same ratio of combina- 
tion for the production of various commodities but do not allow of any 
other use, are to be considered as absolutely specific factors. They are 
absolutely specific with regard to the production of an intermediary prod- 
uct which can be utilized for various purposes. The price of this inter- 
mediary product can be assigned to them cumulatively only. Whether 
this intermediary product can be directly apperceived by the senses or 
whether it is merely the invisible and intangible outcome of their joint 
employment makes no difference. 

4. Cost Accounting 
In the calculation of the entrepreneur costs are the amount of 
money required for the procurement of the factors of production. 


Prices 337 

The entrepreneur is intent upon embarking upon those business proj- 
ects from which he expects the highest surplus of proceeds over 
costs and upon shunning projects from which he expects a lower 
amount of profit or even a loss. In doing this he adjusts his effort to 
the best possible satisfaction of the needs of the consumers. The fact 
that a project is not profitable because costs are higher than proceeds 
is the outcome of the fact that there is a more useful employment avail- 
able for the factors of production requircd. There are other products 
in the purchase of which the consumers are prcpared to allow for the 
prices of the factors of production required. But the consumers are 
not prepared to pay these prices in buying the commodity the pro- 
duction of which is not profitable. 

Cost accounting is affected by thc fact that the two following 
conditions are not always present: 

First, every incrcase in the quantity of factors cxpended for the 
production of a consumers' good increases its power to remove un- 
easiness. 

Second, cvery incrcase in the quantity of a consumers' good re- 
quires a proportional increase in the expenditure of factors of pro- 
duction or even a more than proportional increase in their expendi- 
ture. 

If both thcse conditions were always and without any excep- 
tion fultiIled, every increment z expendcd for increasing the quantity 
7n of a commodity g would be employed for the satisfaction of a need 
viewed as less urgent than the ieast urgent nced already satisfied by the 
quantity m available previously. At the same time the increment z 
would require the employment of factors of production to be with- 
drawn from the satisfaction of other needs considered as more press- 
ing than thosc needs whose satisfaction was foregone in order to 
produce the marginal unit of m. On the one hand the marginal value 
of the satisfaction derived from the increase in the quantity available 
of g would drop. On the other hand the costs required for the pro- 
duction of additiond quantities of g would increase in marginal dis- 
utility; factors of production would be withheld from employments 
in which they could satisfy morc urgent needs. Production must 
stop at the point at which the marginal utility of the increment no 
longer compensates for the marginal increase in the disutility of costs. 

Now these two conditions are present very often, but not generally 
without exception. There exist many commodities of a11 orders of 
goods whose physical structure is not homogeneous and which are 
therefore not perfectly divisible. 

It would, of course, be possible to conjure away the deviation from 


338 Human Action 

the first condition mentioned above by a sophisticated play on words. 
One could say: half a motorcar is not a motorcar. If one adds to half 
a motorcar a quarter of a motorcar, one does not increase the "quan- 
tity" available; only the perfection of the process of production which 
turns out a complete car produces a unit and an increase in the "quan- 
tity" available. However, such an interpretation misses the point. The 
problem we must face is that not every increase in expenditure in- 
creases proportionately the objective use-value, the physical power 
of a thing to render a definite service. The various increments in 
expenditure bring about different results. There arc increments the 
expenditure of which remains useless if no further increments of a 
definite quantity arc added. 

On the other hand-and this is the deviation from the second con- 
dition-an increase in physical omput does not always require a 
proportionate increase in cxpenditurc or even any additional ex-
penditure. It may happen that costs do not rise at all or that their rise 
increases output more than proportionately. For many means of 
production are not homogeneous either and not pcrfec;ly divisible. 
This is the phenomenon known to business as the superiority of big- 
scale production. The economists speak of the law of increasing re- 
turns or decreasing costs. 

Wc consider-as case A-a state of affairs in which ail factors of 
production are not perfectly divisible in such a way that full utiliza- 
tion of the productive services rendered by every further indivisible 
element of each factor requires full utilization of the further in- 
divisible elements of every other of the conlplementary factors. Then 
in every aggregate of productive agents each of the assembled ele- 
ments-every machine, every worker, every piece of raw material- 
can be fully utilized only if all the productive services of the other 
elements are fully employed too. Within these limits the production 
of a part of the maximum output attainable does not require a higher 
expenditure than the production of the highest possible output. We 
may also say that the minimum-size aggregate always produces the 
same quantity of products; it is impossible to produce a smaller quan- 
tity of products even if there is no use for a part of it. 

We consider-as case B-a state of affairs in which one group of the 
productive agents (p) is for all practical purposes perfectly divisible. 
On the other hand the imperfectly divisible agents can be divided 
in such a way that full utilization of the services rcndered by each 
further indivisible part of one agent requires full utilization of the 
further indivisible parts of the other imperfectly divisible comple- 
mentary factors. Then increasing production of an aggregate of 


Prices 339 

further indivisible factors from a partiaI to a more complete utiliza- 
tion of their productive capacity requires merely an increase in the 
quantity of p, the perfectly divisible factors. However, one must 
guard oneself against the fallacy that this necessarily implies a de- 
crease in the average cost of production. It is true that within the 
aggregate of imperfectIy divisible factors each of them is now better 
utilized, that therefore costs of production as far as they are caused 
by the cooperation of these factors remain unchanged,. and that the 
quotas falling to a unit of output are decreasing. But on the other 
hand an increase in the employment of the perfectly divisible factors 
of production can be attained only by withdrawing them from other 
employments. The value of these other employments increases, other 
things being equal, with their shrinking; the price of these perfectly 

divisible factors tends to rise as more of them are used for the better 
utilization of the productive capacity of the aggregate of the not 
further divisible factors in question. One must not limit the considera- 
tion of our problem to the case in which the additional quantity of p 
is withdrawn from other enterprises producing the same product in 
a less efficient way and forces these enterprises to restrict their output. 
It is obvious that in this case-competition between a more and a less 
efficient enterprise producing the same article out of the same raw 
materials-the average cost of production is decreasing in the ex- 
panding plant. A more general scrutiny of the problem leads to a dif- 
ferent result. If the units of p are withdrawn from other employments 
in which they would have been utilized for the production of other 
articles, there emerges a tendency toward an increase in the price 
of these units. This tendency may be compensated by accidental 
tendencies operating in the opposite direction; it may sometimes be so 
feeble that its effects are negligible. But it is always present and 
potentially influences the configuration of costs. 

Finally we consider-as case C-a state of affairs in which the var- 
ious imperfectly divisible factors of production can be divided only 
in such a way that, given the conditions of the market, any size which 
can be chosen for their assemblage in a production aggregate does not 
alIow for a combination in which full utilization of the productive 
capacity of one factor makes possible full utilization of the productive 
capacity of the other imperfectly divisible factors. This case C alone 
is of practical significance, while the cases A and B hardly play any 
role in real business. The characteristic feature of case is that the 
configuration of production costs varies unevenly. If all imperfectly 
divisible factors are utilized to lcss than full capacity, an expansion of 
production res~~lts 

in a decrease of average costs of production unless 


Human Action 

a rise in the prices to be paid for the perfectly divisible factors 
counterbalances this outcome. But as soon as full utilization of the 
capacity of one of the imperfectly divisible factors is attained, fur- 
ther expansion of production causes a sudden sharp rise in costs. Then 
again a tendency toward a decrease in average production costs sets 
in and goes on working until full utilization of one of the imperfectly 
divisible factors is attained anew. 

Other things being equal, the more the production of a certain 
article increases, the more factors of production must be withdrawn 
from other employments in which they would have been used for the 
production of other articles. Hence-other things being equal- 
average production costs increase with the increase in the quantity 
produced. But this general law is by sections superseded by the 
phenomenon that not all factors of production are perfectly divisible 
and that, as far as they can be divided, they are not divisible in such 
a way that full utilization of one of them results in full utilization of 
the other imperfectly divisible factors. 

The planning entrepreneur is always faced with the question: To 
what extent will the anticipated prices of the products exceed the 
anticipated costs? If the entrepreneur is still free with regard to the 
project in question, because he has not yet made any inconvertible 
investments for its realization, it is average costs that count for him. 
But if he has already a vested interest in the line of business concerned, 
he sees things from the angle of additional costs to be expended. He 
who already owns a not fully utilized production aggregate does not 
take into account average cost of production but ~narginal cost. With- 
out regard to the amount already expended for inconvertible invest- 
ments he is merely interested in the question whether or not the 
proceeds from the sale of an additional quantity of products will 
exceed the additional cost incurred by their production. Even if the 
whole amount invested in the inconvertible production facilities must 
be wiped off as loss, he goes on producing provided he expects a 
reasonable surplus of proceeds over current costs. 

With regard to popular errors it is necessary to emphasize that 
if the conditions required for the appearance of monopoly prices are 
not present, an entrepreneur is not in a position to increase his net 
returns by restricting production beyond the amount conforming 
with consumers' demand. But this problem will be dealt with later 
in section 6.

convertible capital used for the continuation of production are at least not lower 
than the anticipated returns on its use for other projects.

That a factor of production is not perfectly divisible does not 
always mean that it can be constructed and employed in one size 
only. This, of course, may occur in some cases. But as a rule it is pos- 
sible to vary the dimensions of these factors. If out of the various 
dimensions which are possible for such a factor-e.g., a machine- 
one dimension is distinguished by the fact that the costs incurred by 
its production and operation are rendered lower per unit of the 
productive services than those for other dimensions, things are es- 
sentially identical. Then the superiority of the bigger plant does not 
consist in the fact that it utilizes a machine to full capacity while the 
smaller plant utilizes only a part of the capacity of a machine of the 
same size. It consists rather in the fact that the bigger plant employs 
a machine which operates with a better utilization of the factors of 
production required for its construction and operation than does the 
smaller machine employed by the smaller plant. 

The role played in all branches of production by the fact that many 
factors of production are not perfectly divisible is very great. It is 
of paramount importance in the course of industrial affairs. But one 
must guard oneself against many misinterpretations of its significance. 

One of these errors was the doctrine according to which in the proc- 
essing industries there prevails a law of increasing returns, while in 
agriculture and mining a law of decreasing returns prevails. The 
fallacies implied have been exploded above."s far as there is a dif- 
ference in this regard between conditions in agriculture and those in 
the processing industries, differences in the data bring them about. 
The immobility of the soil and the fact that the performance of the 
various agricultural operations depends on the seasons make it im-
possible for farmers to take advantage of the capacity of many mov- 
able factors of production to the degree which conditions in manu- 
facturing for the most part allow. The optimum size of a production 
outfit in agricultural production is as a rule much smaller than in the 
processing industries. It is obvious and does not need any further 
explanation why the concentration of farming cannot be pushed to 
anything near the degree obtaining in the processing industries. 

However, the inequality in the distribution of natural resources 
over the earth's surface, which is one of the two factors making for 
the higher productivity of the division of labor, puts a limit to the 
progress of concentration in the processing industries also. The tend- 
ency toward a progressive specialization and the concentration of 
integrated industrial processes in only a few plants is counteracted by 
the geographical dispersion of natural resources. The fact that the 

5. Cf. above, p. 130. 

Human Action 

production of raw materials and foodstuffs cannot be centralized 
and forces people to disperse over the various parts of the earth's 
surface enjoins also upon the processing industries a certain degree 
of decentralization. It makes it necessary to consider the problems of 
transportation as a particular factor of production costs. The costs of 
transportation must be weighed against the economies to be expected 
from more thoroughgoing specialization. W7hile in some branches of 
the processing industries the utmost concentration is the most ade- 
quate net hod of reducing costs, in other branches a certain degree of 
decentralization is more advantageous. In the servicing trades the dis- 
advantages of concentration become so great that they almost en- 
tirely overweigh the advantages derived. 

Then a historical factor comes into play. In the past capital goods 
were immobilized on sites on which our contemporaries would not 
have set them. It is immaterial whether or not this immobilization was 
the most economical procedure to which the generations that brought 
it about could resort. In any event the present generation is faced with 
a fait accompli. It must adjust its operations to the fact and it must 
take it into account in dealing with problems of the location of the 
processing ind~stries.~ 

Finally there are institutional factors. There are trade and migra- 
tion barriers. There are differences in political organization and meth- 
ods of government between various countries. Vast areas are adminis- 
tered in such a way that it is practically out of the question to choose 
them as a seat for any capital investment no matter how favorable their 
physical conditions may be. 

Entrepreneurial cost accounting must deal with all these geographi- 
cal, hjstorical and institutional factors. But even apart from them there 
are purely tcchnical factors limiting the optimum size of plants and 
firms. The greater plant or firm may require provisions and proce- 
dures which the smaller plant or firm can avoid. In: many instances 
the outlays caused by such provisions and procedures may be over- 
compensated by the reduction in costs derived from better utiiization 
of the capacity of some of the not perfectly divisible factors employed. 
In other instances this may not be the case. 

Under capitalism the irithmetical operations required for cost 
accounting and the confrontation of costs and proceeds can easily be 
effected as there are methods of economic calculation available. How- 
ever, cost accounting and calculation of the economic significance of

business projects under consideration is not merely a mathematical 
problem which can be solved satisfactorily by all those familiar with 
the elementary rules of arithmetic. The main question is the deter- 
mination of the money equivalents of the items which are to enter 
into the cakulation. It is a mistake to assume, as many economists do, 
that these equivalents are given magnitudes, uniquely determined by 
the state of economic conditions. They are speculative anticipations 
of uncertain future conditions and as such depend on the entrepre- 
neur's understanding of the future state of the market. The term 
fixedcosts is also in this regard somewhat misleading. 

Every action aims at the best possible supplying of future needs. 
To achicve these ends it must make the best possible use of the avail- 
able factors of production. However, the historical process which 
brought about the present state of factors available is beside the point. 
What counts and influences the decisions concerning future action 
is solely the outcome of this historical process, the quantity and the 
quality of the factors available today. These factors are appraised 
only with regard to their ability to render producrive services for the 
removal of future uneasiness. The amount of money spent in the past 
for their production and acquisition is immaterial. 

It has already been pointed out that an entrepreneur who by the 

time he has to make a new decision has expended money for the 

realization of a definite project is in a differcnt position from that of 

a man who starts afresh. The former owns a complex of inconvertible 

factors of production which he can employ for ccrtain purposes. His 

decisions concerning further action will be influenced by this fact. 

But he appraises this complex not according to what he expended in 

the past for its acquisition. He appraises it exclusively from the point 

of view of its usefulness for future action. The fact that he has spent 

more or less for its acquisition is insignificant. This fact is only a factor 

in determining the amount of the entrepreneur's past losses or profits 

and the prescnt state of his fortune. It is an element in the historical 

process that brought about the present state of the supply of factors 

of production and as such it is of importance for future action. But 

it does not count for the planning of future action and the calculation 

regarding such action. It is irrelevant that the entries in the firm's 

books differ from the actual price of such inconvertible factors of 

production. 

Of course, such consummated losses or profits may motivate a 

firm to operate in a different way from which it would if it were not 

affected by them. Past losses may render a firm's financial position 

precarious, especially if they bring about indebtedness and burden 


3 44 Human Action 

it with payments of interest and installments on the principal. How- 
ever, it is not correct to refer to such payments as a part of fixed 
costs. They have no relation whatever to the current operations. 
They are not caused by the process of production, but by the methods 
employed by the entrepreneur in the past for the procurement of the 
capital and capital goods needed. They are only accidental with 
reference to the going concern. But they may enforce upon the firm 
in question a conduct of affairs which it would not adopt if it were 
financially stronger. The urgent need for cash in order to meet pay- 
ments due does not affect its cost accounting, but its appraisal of ready 
cash as compared w-it11 cash that can only be received at a later day. 
It may impel the firm to sell inventories at an inappropriate moment 
and to use its durable production equipment in a way that unduly 
neglects its conservation for later use. 

It is immaterial for the problems of cost accounting whether a firm 
owns the capital invested in its enterprise or whether it has borrowed 
a greater or smaller part of it and is bound to comply with the terms 
of a loan contract rigidly fixing the rate of interest and the dates of 
maturity for interest and principal. The costs of production include 
only the interest on the capital which is still existent and working in 
the enterprise. It does not include interest on capital squandered jn 
the past by bad investment or by inefficiency in the conduct of cur- 
rent business operations. The task incumbent upon the businessman 
is always to use the supply of capital goods now available in the best 
possible way for the satisfaction of future needs. In the pursuit of 
this aim he must not be misled by past errors and failures the con- 
sequences of which cannot be brushed away. A plant may have been 
constructed in the past which would not have been built if one had 
better forecast the present situation. It is vain to lament this his- 
torical fact. The main thing is to find out whether or not the plant 
can still render any service and, if this question is answered in the 
affirmative, hour it can be best utilized. It is certainly sad for the in- 
dividual entrepreneur that he did not avoid errors. The losses in- 

curred impair his financial situation. They do not affect the costs to 

be taken into account in planning further action. 

It is important to stress this point because it has been distorted in 

the current interpretation and justification of various measures. One 

does not '%educe costs" by alleviating some firms' and corporations' 

burden of debts. A policy of wiping out debts or the interest due 

on them totally or in part does not reduce costs. It transfers wealth 

from creditors to debtors; it shifts the incidence of losses incurred 

in the past from one group of people to another group, e.g., from 


Prices 345 

the owners of common stock to those of preferred stock and cor- 
porate bonds. This argument of cost reduction is often advanced in 
favor of currency devaluation. It is no less fallacious in this case than 
all the other arguments brought forward for this purpose. 

What are commonly called fixed costs are also the costs incurred 
by the exploitation of the already available factors of production 
which are either rigidly inconvertihle or can be adapted for other 
productive purposes only at a considerable loss. These factors are of 
a more durable character than the other factors of production re-
quired. But they are not permanent. They are used up in the process 
of production. With each unit of product turned out a part of the 
n~achine's power to produce is cxhausted. 'The extent of this attrition 
can be precisely ascertained by technology and can be appraised 
accordingly in terms of money. 

However, it is not only this money equivalent of the machine's 
wearing out which the entrepreneurial calculation has to consider. The 
t)usinessman is not merely concerned with thc duration of the ma- 
chine's technological life. He must take into account the future state 
of the market. Although a machine may still be technologically per- 
fectly utilizable, market conditions may render it obsolete and worth- 
less. If the demand for its products drops considerably or disappears 
altogether or if more efficient methods for supplying the consumers 
with these products appear, the machine is economically merely scrap 
iron. In planning the conduct of his business the entrepreneur must 
pay full regard to the anticipated future state of the market. The 
amount of "fixed" costs which enter into his calculation depends 
on his understanding of future events. It is not to be fixed simply by 
technological reasoning. 

The technologist may determine the optimum for a production 
aggregate's utilization. But this technological optimum may differ 
from that which the entrepreneur on the ground of his judgment con- 
cerning future market conditions enters into his economic calculation. 
Let us assume that a factory is equipped with machines which can be 
utilized for a period of ten years. Every year ro per cent of their 
prime costs is laid aside for depreciation. In the third year market 
conditions place a dilemma before the entrepreneur. He can double 
his output for the year and sell it at a price which (apart from cover- 
ing the increase id variable costs) exceeds the quota of depreciation 
for the current year and the present value of the last depreciation 
quota. But this doubling of production trebles the wearing out of 
the equipment and the surplus proceeds from the saIe of the double 
quantity of products are not great enough to make good also for the 


Human Action 

present value of the depreciation quota of the ninth year. If the entre- 
preneur were to consider the annuaI depreciation quota as a rigid 
element for his calculation, he would have to deem the doubling of 
production as not profitable, as additional proceeds lag behind addi- 
tional cost. He would abstain from expanding production beyond 
the technological optimum. But the entrepreneur calculates in a dif- 
ferent way, although in his accountancy he may lay aside the same 
quota for depreciation every year. Whether or not the entrcpreneur 
prefers a fraction of the present value of the ninth year's depreciation 
quota to the technological services which the machines could render 
him in the ninth year, depends on his opinion concerning the future 
state of the market. 

Public opinion, governments and legislators, and the tax laws look 
upon a business outfit as a source of permanent revenue. They believe 
that the entrcpreneur who makes due allowance for capital main- 
tenance by annual depreciation quotas will aIways be in a position to 
reap a reasonable return from the capital invested in his durable 
producers' goods. Real conditions are different. A production ag- 
gregate such as a plant and its equipment is a factor of production 
whose usefulness depends on changing marltet conditions and the skill 
of the entrepreneur in employing it in accordance with the change 
in conditions. 

There is in the field of economic calculation nothing that is certain 
in the sense in which this term is used with regard to technological 
facts. The esscntial elements of economic calculation are speculative 
anticipations of future conditions. Commercial usages and customs 
and commercial laws have established definite rules for accountancy 
and auditing. There is accuracy in the keeping of books. But they are 
accurate only with regard to these rules. The book values do not re- 
flect precisely the real state of affairs. The market value of an aggre- 
gate of durable producers' goods may differ from the nominal figures 
the books show. The proof is that the Stock Exchange appraises them 
without any regard to these figures. 

Cost accounting is therefore not an arithmetical process which can 
be estabIished and examined by an indifferent umpire. It does not 
operate w-ith uniquely determined magnitudes which can be found 
out in an objective way. Its esscntial items are the result of an under- 
standing of future conditions, necessarily always colored by the 
entrepreneur's opinion about the future state of the market. 

Attempts to establish cost accounts on an "impartial" basis are 
doomed to failure. Calculating costs is a mental tool of action, the pur- 
posive design to make the best of the available means for an improve- 


Prices 347 

ment of future conditions. It is necessarily volitional, not factual. In 
the hands of an indifferent umpire it changes its character entirely. 
The umpire does not look forward to the future. He looks backward 
to the dead past and to rigid rules which are useless for real life and 
action. He does not anticipate changes. He is unwittingly guided by 
the prepossession that the evenly rotating economy is the normal and 
most desirable state of human affairs. Profits do not fit into his scheme. 
He has a confused idea about a "fair" rate of profit or a "fair" return 
on capital invested. However, there are no such things. In the evenly 
rotating economy there are no profits. In a changing economy profits 
are not determined with reference to any set of rules by which they 
could be classified as fair or unfair. Profits are never normal. Where 
there is normality, i.e., absence of change, no profits can emerge. 

5. Logical Catallactics Versus Mathematical Catallactics 
The problems of prices and costs have been treated also with 
mathematical methods. There have even been economists who held 
that the only appropriate method of dealing with economic problems 
is the mathematical method and who derided the logical economists 
as "literary" economists. 

If this antagonism between the logical and the mathematical econo- 
mists were merely a disagreement concerning the most adequate 
procedure to be applied in the study of economics, it would be 
superfluous to pay attention to it. The better method would prove 
its preeminence by bringing about better results. It may also be that 
different varieties of procedure are necessary for the solution of 
different problems and that for some of them one method is more 
useful than the other. 

However, this is not a dispute about heuristic questions, but a con- 
troversy concerning the foundations of economics. The mathematical 
method must be rejected not only on account of its barrenness. It is 
an entirely vicious merhod, srarring from fake assumptions and iead- 
ing to fallacious inferences. Its syllogisms are not only sterile; they 
divert the mind from the study of the real problems and distort the 
relations between the various phenomena. 

The ideas and procedures of the mathematical economists are not 
uniform. There are three main currents of thought which must be 
dealt with separately. 

The first variety is represented by the statisticians who aim at 
discovering economic laws from the study of economic experience. 
I'hey aiin to transform economics into a "quantitative" science. Their 


program is condensed in the motto of the Econometric Society: 
Science is measurement. 

The fundamental error implied in this reasoning has been shown 
above.i Experience of economic history is always experience of com- 
plex phenomena. It can never convey knowledge of the kind the 
experimenter abstracts from a laboratory experiment. Statistics is a 
method for the presentation of historical facts concerning prices 
and other relevant data of human action. It is not economics and can- 
not produce economic theorems and theories. The statistics of prices 
is economic history. The insight that, ceteris paribus, an increase 
in demand must result in an increase in prices is not derived from 
experience. Kobody ever was or ever will be in a position to ob- 
serve a change in one of the market data ceteris paribus. There is 
no such thing as quantitative economics. All economic quantities we 
know about are data of economic history. No reasonable man can 
contend that the relations between price and supply is in general, 
or in respect of certain commodities, constant. We know, on the 
contrary, that external phenomena affect different people in differ- 
ent ways, that the reactions of the same people to the same external 
events vary, and that it is not possible to assign individuals to classes 
of men reacting in the same way. This insight is a product of our 
aprioristic theory. It is true the empiricists reject this theory; they 
pretend that they aim to learn only frorn historical experience. How- 
ever, they contradict their own principles as soon as they pass be- 
yond the unadulterated recording of individual single prices and 
begin to construct series and to compute averages. A datum of ex-
perience and a statistical fact is only a price paid at a definite time 
and a definite place for a definite quantity of a certain commodity. 
The arrangement of various price data in groups and the computation 
of averages are guided by theoretical deliberations which are logically 
and temporally antecedent. The extent to which certain attending 
features and circumstantial contingencies of the price data concerned 
are cake~ior not taken inco consideration depends on theoreticai 
reasoning of the same kind. Nobody is so bold as to maintain that a 
rise of a per cent in the supply of any commodity must always-in 
every country and at any time-result in a fall of b per cent in its 
price. But as no quantitative econon~ist ever ventured to define pre- 
cisely on the ground of statistical experience the spcciaI conditions 
producing a definite deviation from the ratio a : b, the futilitv of his 
endeavors is manifest. Moreover, money is not a standard 'for the 
nxasurcment of prices; it is a medium whose exchange ratio varies 

7. Cf. above, pp. 31, 55-56, 

Prices 349 

in the same way, although as a rule not with the same speed and to 
the same extent, in which the mutual exchange ratios of the vendible 

-

commodities and services vary. 

There is hardly any need to dwelI longer upon the exposure of the 
claims of quantitative economics. In spite of all the high-sounding 
pronouncements of its advocates, nothing has been done for the 
realization of its program. The late Henry Schultz devoted his re- 
search to the measurement of elasticities of demand for various com- 
modities. Professor Paul H. Douglas has praised the outcome of 
Schultz's studies as "a work as necessary to help make economics 
a more or less exact science as was the determination of atomic 
weights for the development of chemistry." The truth is that Schultz 
never embarked upon a determination of the elasticity of demand for 
any commodity as such; the data he relied upon were limited to cer- 
tain geographical areas and historical periods. His results for a definite 
commodity, for instance potatoes, do not refer to potatoes in general, 
but to potatoes in the United States in the years from 1875 to 1929.~ 
They are, at best, rather questionable and unsatisfactory contributions 
to various chapters of economic history. They are certainly not steps 
toward the realization of the confused and contradictory program 
of quantitative economics. It must be emphasized that the two other 
varieties of mathematical economics are fully aware of the futility of 
quantitative economics. For they have never ventured to make any 
magnitudes as found by the econometricians enter into their formulas 
and equations and thus to adapt them for the solution of particular 
problems. There is in the field of human action no means of dealing 
with future events other than that provided by understanding. 

The second field treated by mathematical economists is that of the 
rclation of prices and costs. In dealing with these problems the 
mathematical economists disregard the operation of the market process 
and moreover pretend to abstract from the use of money inherent 
in all econonlic calculations. However, as they speak of prices and 
costs in generai and confront prices and costs, they tacitiy impiy the 
existence and the use of money. Prices are always money prices, and 
costs cannot be taken into account in economic calculation if not 
expressed in terms of money. If one does not resort to terms of money, 
costs are expressed in complex quantities of diverse goods and serv- 
ices to he expended for the procurement of a product. On the other 
hand prices-if this term is applicabIe at all to exchange ratios deter-

mined by barter-are the enumeration of quantities of various goods 
against which the "seller" can exchange a definite supply. The goods 
which are referred to in such "prices" are not the same to which the 
"costs" refer. A comparison of such prices in kind and costs in kind 
is not feasible. That the seller values the goods he gives away less than 
those he receives in exchange for them, that the seller and the buyer 
disagree with regard to the subjective valuation of the two goods 
exchangcd, and that an entrepreneur embarks upon a project only 
if he expects to receive for the product goods that he values higher 
than those expended in their production, all this we know alreadv on 
the ground of praxeological comprehension. It is this aprio;istic 
know-ledge that enables us to anticipate the conduct of an entrepre- 
neur who is in a position to resort to economic calculation. But the 
~nathematical economist deludes himself when he pretends to treat 
thcsc problems in a more general way by omitting any reference to 
terms of money. It is vain to investigate instances of nonperfect divisi- 
bility of factors of production without reference to economic calcula- 
tion in terms of money. Such a scrutiny can never go beyond the 
knowledge already available; namely tha; every entrepreneur is intent 
upon producing those articles the sale of which will bring him pro- 
ceeds that he values higher than the total complex of goods expended 
in their production. But if there is no indirect exchange and if no me- 
dium of cxchange is in common use, he can succeed, provided he has 
correctly anticipated the future state of the market, only if he is en- 
dowed with a superhuman intellect. He would have to take in at a 
glance all exchange ratios determined at the market in such a way as to 
assign in his deliberations precisely the place due to every good ac- 
cording to these ratios. 
It cannot be denied that all investigations concerning the relation 
of prices and costs presuppose both the use of money and the mar- 
ket process. But the mathematical economists shut their eyes to this 
obvious fact. They formulate equations and draw curves which are 
supposed ro describe reaiiry. in fact they describe oniy a hypothetical 
and unrealizablc state of affairs, in no way similar to the catallactic 
problems in question. They substitute algebraic symbols for the deter- 
minate terms of money as used in economic calculation and believe 
that this- procedure rcnders their reasoning more scientific. They 
strongly impress the gullible layman. In fact they only confuse and 
muddle things which are satisfactorily dealt with in textbooks of 
commercial arithmetic and accountancy. 
Some of thcsc mathematicians have gone so far as to declare that 
economic calculation could be established on the basis of units of 


Prices 351 

utility. They call their methods utility analysis. Their error is shared 
by the third variety of mathematical economics. 

The characteristic mark of this third group is that they are openly 
and consciously intent upon solving catallactic problems without 
any reference to the market process. Their ideal is to construct an 
economic theory according to the pattern of mechanics. They again 
and again resort to analogies with classical mechanics which in their 
opinion is the unique and absolute model of scientific inquiry. There 
is no need to explain again why this analogy is superficial and mis- 
leading and in what respects purposive human action radically differs 
from motion, the subject matter of mechanics. It is enough to stress 
one point, viz., the practical significance of the differential equations 
in both fields. 

The deliberations which result in the formulation of an equation 
are necessarily of a nonmathematical character. The formulation of 
the equation is the consummation of our knowledge; it does not 
directly enlarge our knowledge. Yet, in mechanics the equation can 
render very important practical services. As there exist constant 
relations between various mechanical elements and as these relations 
can be ascertained by experiments, it becomes possible to use equa- 
tions for the solution of definite technological problems. Our modern 
industrial civilization is mainly an accomplishment of this utilization 
of the differential equations of physics. No such constant relations 
exist, however, between economic elements. The equations formu- 
lated by mathematical economics remain a useless piece of mental 
gymnastics and would remain so even if they were to express much 
more than they really do. 

A sound economic deliberation must never forget these two funda- 
mental principles of the theory of value: First, valuing that results in 
action always means preferring and setting aside; it never means 
equivalence. Second, there is no means of comparing the valuations 
of different individuals or the valuations of the same individuals at 
diEerent instants other than by estabiisiiing whether or not they ar- 
range the alternatives in question in the same order of preference. 

In the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy all 

factors of production are employed in such a way that each of them 

renders the most valuable service. No thinkable and possible change 

could improve the state of satisfaction; no factor is employed for the 

satisfaction of a need a if this employment prevents the satisfaction 

of a need b that is considered more valuable than the satisfaction of 

a. It is, of course, possible to describe this imaginary state of the 
allocation of resources in differential equations and to visualize it 

3 52 Human Action 

graphically in curves. But such devices do not assert anything about 
the market process. They mereIy mark out an imaginary situation in 
which the market process would cease to operate. The mathematical 
economists disregard the whole theoretical elucidation of the market 
process and evasively amuse themselves with an auxiliary notion 
employed in its context and devoid of any sense when used outside 
of this context. 

In physics we are faced with changes occurring in various sense 
phenomena. We discover a regularity in the sequence of these changes 
and these observations lead us to the construction of a science of 
physics. We know nothing about the ultimate forces actuating these 
changes. They are for the searching rnind ultimately given and defy 
any further analysis. What we know from observation is the regular 
concatenation of various observable entities and attributes. It is this 
mutual interdependence of data that the physicist describes in dif-
ferential equations. 

In praxeology the first fact we know is that men are purposively 
intent upon bringing about some changes. It is this Itnowled, <re that 
integrates the subject matter of praxeology and differentiates it from 
the subject matter of the natural sciences. We know the forces behind 
the changes, and this aprioristic knowledge leads us to a cognition of 
the praxeological processes. The physicist does not know what 
electricitv "is." I-Ic knows only phenomena attributed to something 
called electricity. But the economist knows what actuates the market 
process. It is only thanks to this ltnowlcdge that he is in a position to 
distinguish market phenomena from other phenomena and to describe 
the market process. 

Now, the mathematical economists does not contribute anything 
to the elucidation of the market process. Hc mercly describes an 
auxiliary makeshift employed by the logical economists as a limiting 
notion, the definition of a state of affairs in which there is no longer 
any action and the market process has come to a standstiI1. That is 
all he can sav. -W-hat the iogicai economist sets forth in words when 
defining the- imaginary constructions of the final state of rest and 
the evenly rotating economy and what the mathematical economist 
himself must describe in words before he embarks upon his mathe- 
matical work, is translated into algebraic symbols. A superficial anal- 
ogy is spun out too long, that is alI. 

Both the logical and the mathematical economists assert that human 
action ultimately aims at the establishment of such a state of equilib- 
rium and would reach it if all further changes in data were to cease. 
But the logical economist knows much more than that. Me shows how 


Prices 353 

the activities of enterprising men, the promoters and speculators, 
eager to profit from discrepancics in the price structure, tend toward 
eradicating such discrepancies and thcreby also toward blotting out 
the sources of entrepreneurial profit and loss. He shows how this 
process would finally result in the establishment of the cvenly rotating 
economy. This is the task of economic theory. The mathematical 
description of various states of equilibrium is mere play. The problem 
is the analysis of the market process. 

A comparison of both methods of economic analysis makes us 
understand the meaning of the often raised request to enlarge the scope 
of economic science by the construction of a dynamic theory instead 
of the mcre occupation with static problems. With regard to logical 
economics this postulate is devoid of any sense. Logical economics 
is essentially a theory of processes and changes. It resorts to the im- 
aginary constructions of changelessness mcrely for the elucidation 
of the phenomena of change. But it is different with mathematical 
economics. Its equations and formula are limited to the description 
of states of equilibrium and nonacting. It cannot assert anything with 
rcgard to the formation of such states and their transformation into 
other states as long as it remains in the realm of mathematical proce- 
dures. As against mathematical econon~ics the request for a dynamic 
theory is well substantiated. But there is no means for mathematical 
economics to comply with this request. The problems of process 
analysis, i.e., the only economic problems that matter, defy any 
mathematical approach. The introduction of time parameters into the 
equations is no solution. It does not even indicate the essential short- 
comings of the mathematical method. The statements that every 
change involves time and that change is always in thc temporal se- 
quence are merely a way of expressing the fact that as far as there 
is rigidity and unchangeability there is no time. The main deficiency 
of mathematical economics is not the fact that it ignores thc temporal 
sequence, but that it ignores the operation of the market process. 

The mathematicai nlethod is at a ioss to show Row from a state 
of nonequilibrium those actions spring up which tend toward the 
cstablishmcnt of equilibrium. It is, of course, possible to indicate the 
mathematical operations required for the transformation of the 
mathematical description of a definite state of nonequilibrium into 
the ~nathematical description of the state of equilibrium. But these 
mathematical operations by no means describe the market process 
actuated by the discrepancies in the price structure. The differential 
equations of mechanics are supposed to describe precisely the motions 
concerned at any instant of the time traveled through. The economic 


3 54 Human Action 

equations have no reference whatever to conditions as they really are 
in each instant of the time interval between the state of nonequilib- 
rium and that of equilibrium. Only those entirely blinded by the 
prepossession that economics must be a pale replica of mechanics 
will underrate the weight of this objection. A very imperfect and 
superficial metaphor is not a substitute for the services rendered by 
logical economics. 

In every chapter of catallactics the devastating consequences of 
the mathematical treatment of economics can be tested. It is enough 
to refer to two instances only. One is provided by the so-called 
equation of exchange, the mathematical economists' futile and mis- 
leading attempt to deal with changes in the purchasing power of 
money.1° The second can be best expressed in referring to Professor 
Schumpeter's dictum according to which consumers in evaluating 
consumers' goods "ipso facto also evaluate the means of production 
which enter into the production of these goods." l1 It is hardly pos- 
sible to construe the market process in a more erroneous way. 

Economics is not about goods and services, it is about the actions 
of living men. Its goal is not to dwell upon imaginary constructions 
such as equilibrium. These constructions are only tools of reason-
ing. The sole task of economics is analysis of the actions of men, is the 
analysis of processes. 

6. Monopoly Prices 
Competitive prices are the outcome of a complete adjustment of 
the sellers to the demand of the consumers. Under the competitive 
price the whole supply available is sold, and the specific factors of 
production are employed to the extent permitted by the prices of 
the nonspecific complementary factors. No part of a supply available 
is permanently withheld from the market, and the marginal unit of 
specific factors of production employed does not yield any net 
proceed. The whole economic process is conducted for the benefit 
of the consumers. There is no conflict between the interests of the 
buyers and those of the sellers, between the interests of the producers 
and those of the consumers. The owners of the various commodities 
are not in a position to divert consumption and production from the 
lines enjoined by the state of supply of goods and services of all 
orders and the state of technological knowledge.

Prices 355 

Every single seller would see his &vn proceeds increased if a fall 
in the supply at the disposal of his competitors were to increase the 
price at which he himself could sell his own supply. But on a com-
petitive market he is not in a position to bring about this outcome. 
Except for a privilege derived from government interference with 
business he must submit to the state of the market as it is. 

The entrepreneur in his entrepreneurial capacity is always subject 
to the full supremacy of the consumers. It is different with the owners 
of vendible goods and factors of production and, of course, with the 
entrepreneurs in their capacity as owners of such goods and factors. 
Under certain conditions they fare better by restricting supply and 
selling it at a higher price per unit. The prices thus determined, the 
monopoly prices, are an infringement of the supremacy of the con- 
sumers and the democracy of the market. 

The special conditions and circumstances required for the enler- 
gence of monopoly prices and their catallactic features are: 

I. There must prevail a monopoly of supply. The whole s~zpply of 
the monopolized commodity is controlled by a single seller or a 
group of sellers acting in concert. The monopolist-whether one 
individual or a group of individuals-is in a position to restrict the 
supply offcred for sale or enlployed for production in order to raise 
the price per unit sold and need not fear that his plan will be fru! . 
trated by interference on the part of other sellers of the same com- 
modity. 
2. Either the monopolist is not in a position to discriminate among 
the buyers or he voluntarily abstains from such discrimination.12 
3. he reaction of the buying public to the rise in prices bevond 
the potential competitive price, the fall in demand, is not such-as to 
render the proceeds resulting from total sales at any price exceeding 
the competitive price smaller than total proceeds resulting from total 
sales at the competitive price. Hence it is superfluous to enter into 
sophisticated disquisitions concerning what must be considered the 
mark of the sameness of an article. It is not necessary to raise the ques- 
tion whether all neckties are to be called specimens of the same 
article or whether one should distinguish them with regard to fabric, 
color, and pattern. An academic delimitation of various articles is 
useless. The only point that counts is the way in which the buvers 
react to the rise in prices. For the theory of monopoly price -it is 
irrelevant to observe that every necktie manufacturer turns out dif- 
ferent artides and to call each of them a monopolist. Catallactics does 
not deal with monopoly as such but with monopoly prices. A seller 
x 2. Price discrimination is dealt with below, pp. 385-388. 


Human Action 

of neckties which arc different from those offered for sale by other 
people could attain monopoly prices only if the buyers did not react 
to any rise in prices in such a way as to make such a rise disadvanta- 
geous for him. 

itlonopoly is a prerequisite for the emergence of monopoly prices, 
but it is not the only prerequisite. There is a further condition re- 
quired, namely a certain shape of the demand curve. The mere exist- 
ence of monopoly does not mean anything. The publisher of a copy- 
right book is a monopolist. But he may not be able to sell a single 
copy, no matter how low the price he asks. hTot every price at which 
a monopolist sells a monopolized commodity is a monopoly price. 
Monopoly prices are only prices at which it is more advantageous for 
the monopolist to restrict the total amount to be sold than to expand 
his sales to the limit which a competitive market would allow. They 
are the outcome of a deliberate design tending toward a restriction of 
trade. 

Tn calling the monopolist's conduct deliberate, it is not meant to 
suggest that he compares the monopoly price he is asking with the 
competitive price which a hypothetical nonmonopolized market 
would have determined. It is only the economist who contrasts the 
~nonopoly price with the potential competitive price. Tn the dclibcra- 
tions of the monopolist who has already got his monopolistic position, 
the competitive price plays no role at all. Like every other seller he 
wants to realize the highest price attainable. It is only the state of the 
market as conditioned by his monopolistic position on the one hand 
and the conduct of the buyers on the other that results in the emer- 
gence of monopoly prices. 

4. It is a fundamental mistake to assume that there is a third cate- 
gory of prices which are neither monopoly prices nor competitive 
prices. If we disregard the problem of price discrimination to be 
dealt with later, a definite price is either a competitive price or a 
monopoly price. The assertions to the contrary are due to the erro- 
neous belief that competition is not free or perfect unless everybody 
is in a position to present himself as a seller of a definite com-
modity. 
The available supply of every commodity is Iimited. If it were not 
scarce with regard to the demand of the public, the thing in question 
would not be considered an economic good, and no price would be 
paid for it. It is therefore misleading to apply the concept of monopoly 
in such a way as to make it cover the entire field of economic goods. 
Mere 1imitaGon of supply is thc source of economic value and of 


Prices 357 

all prices paid; as such it is not yet sufficient to generate monopoly 
prices.13 

The term monopolistic or imperfect competition is applied today 
to the cases in which there are some differences in the products of 
different producers and sellers. This means that almost all consumers' 
goods are included in the class of monopolized goods. However, the 
only question relevant in the study of the determination of prices is 
whether these differences can be used by the seller for a scheme of 
deliberate restriction of supply for the sake of increasing his total 
net proceeds. Only if this is possible and put into effect, can monopoly 
prices emerge as differentiated from competitive prices. It may be 
true that every seller has a clientele which prefers his brand to those 
of his competitors and would not stop buying it even if the price were 
higher. But the problem for the seller is whether the number of such 
people is great enough to overcompensate the reduction of totaI sales 
which the abstention from buying on the part of other people would 
bring about. Only if this is the case, can he consider the substitution 
of monopoly prices for competitive prices advantageous. 

The confusion which led to the idea of imperfect or monopolistic 
competition stems from a misinterpretation of the term control of 
supply. Every producer of every product has his share in con-
trolling the supply of all commodities offered for sale. If he had 
produced more a, he would have increased supply and brought about 
a tendency toward a lower price. But the question is why he did not 
produce more of a. Was he in restricting his production of a to the 
amount of p intent upon complying to the best of his abilities with 
the wishes of the consumers? Or was he intent upon defying the 
orders of the consumers for his own advantage? In the first case he 
did not produce more of a, because increasing the quantity of n be-
yond p would have withdrawn scarce factors of production from 
other branches in which they would have been employed for the 
satisfaction of more urgent needs of the consumers. He does not 
produse p +r, hut mere!^ p, because such an increase wdd have 
rendercd his business unprofitable or less profitable, while there are 
still other more profitable employments available for capital invest- 
ment. In the second case he did not produce r, because it was more 
advantageous for him to leave a part of the available supply of a 
monopolized specific factor of production m unused. If m were not 
monopolized by him, it would have been impossible for him to ex- 

r 3. Cf. the refutation of the misleading extension of the concept of monopoly

3 58 Human Action 

pect any advantage from restricting his production of a. His com- 
petitors would have filled the gap and he would not have been in a 
position to ask higher prices. 

In dealing with monopoly prices we must always search for the 
monopolized factor 7n. If no such factor is in the case, no monopoly 
prices can emerge. The first requirement for monopoly prices is the 
existence of a monopolized good. If no quantity of such a good nz is 
withheld, there is no opportunity for an entrepreneur to substitute 
monopoly prices for competitive prices. 

Entrepreneurial profit has nothing at all to do with monopoly. If 
an entrepreneur is in a position to sell at monopoly prices, he owes 
this advantage to his monopoly with regard to a monopolized factor 

m. He earns the specific monopoly gain from his ownership of m,not 
from his specific entrepreneurial activities. 
Let us assume that an accident cuts a city's electrical supply for 
several days and forces the residents to resort to candlelight only. 
The price of candles rises to s; at this price the whole supply avail- 
able is sold out. The stores selling candles reap a high profit ii selling 
their whole supply at s. But it could happen that the storekeepers 
combine in order to withhold a part of their stock from the market 
and to sell the rest at a price s -+ t. While s would have been the 
competitive price, s +t is a monopoly price. The surplus earned by 
the storekeepers at the price s +t over the proceeds they would have 
earned when selling at s only is their specific monopoly gain. 

It is immaterial in what way the storekeepers bring about the 
restriction of the supply offered for sale. The physical destruction of 
a part of the supply availabIe is the classical case of monopolistic 
action. Only a short time ago it was practiced by the Brazilian govern- 
ment in burning large quantities of coffee. nut the same effect can be 
attained by leaving a part of the supply unused. 

While there constantly prevails a tendency to make profits dis- 
appear, the specific monopoly gain is a permanent phenomenon and 
can disappear only with a change in the market data. While profits 
are incompatible with the imaginary construction of the evenly rotat- 
ing economy, monopoly prices and specific monopoly gains are not. 

5. The competitive price is determined by the state of the market. 
There prevails on a competitive market a tendency toward the dis- 
appearance of differences in prices and the establishment of a uniform 
price. With regard to monopoly prices things are different. If it is 
possible for the seller to increase his net proceeds by restricting sales 
and increasing prices per unit sold, then as a rule there are several 
monopoly prices which satisfy this condition. As a rule one of these 

Prices 3 59 

monopoly prices yields the highest net proceeds. But it may also 
happen that various monopoly prices are equally advantageous to 
the monopolist. We may call this monopoly price or these monopoly 
prices most advantageous to the monopolist the optimum ~nonopoly 
price or the optimum monopoly prices. 

6. The monopolist does not know beforehand in what way the con- 
sumers will react to a rise in prices. Hc must resort to trial and error 
in his endeavors to find out whether the monopolizcd good can be 
sold to his advantage at any price exceeding the competitive price 
and, if this is so, which of various possible monopoly prices is the 
optimum monopoly price or one of the optimum rnonopoly prices. 
This is in practice much more difficult than the economist assumes 
when, in drawing demand curves, he ascribes perfect foresight to the 
monopolist. We must therefore list as a special condition required for 
the appearance of monopoly priccs the monopolist's abiIity to dis- 
cover such prices. 
7. A special case is provided by the incomplete monopoly. The 
grcater part of the totaI supply available is owned by the n~onb~o~ist; 
the rest is owned by one or several men who are not prepared to co- 
operate with the monopolist in a scheme for restricting sales and 
bringing about monopoly priccs. However, the reluctance of these 
outsiders does not prevent the establishment of monopoly prices if 
the portion p, controlled by the monopolist is large enough when com- 
pared with the sum of the outsiders' portions p,. Let us assume that 
the whole supply (p=p, +p,) can be sold at the price c per unit and 
a supply of p -z at the monopoly price d. If d (p, -z) is higher 
than c p,, it is to the advantage of the monopolist to embark upon a 
lnonopolistic restriction of his sales, no matter what the conduct of the 
outsiders may be. They may go on selling at the price c or they may 
raise their pkes up to the maximum of d. The only point that counts 
is that the outsiders are not willing to put up with a reduction in the 
quantity which they themselves are selling. The whole reduction re- 
quired must be borne by the owner of p,. This influences his plans 
and will as a rule result in the emergence of a monopoly price which 
is different from that which would have been established under com- 
plete monopoly.14 
8. Duopoly and oIigopoly are not special varieties of monopoly 
prices, but merely a variety of the methods applied for the establish- 
ment of a rnonopoly price. Two or several men own the whole supply. 
They all are prepared to sell at monopoly prices and to restrict their 
14. It is obvious that an incomplete nionopolp scheme is bound to collapse if 
the outsiders come into a position to expand their sales. 

Hu7;1zan Action 
total sales accordingly. But for some reason they do not want to act 
in concert. Each of them goes his own way without any formal or 
tacit agreement with his competitors. But each of them knows also 
that his rivals are intent upon R monopolistic restriction of their sales 
in order to reap higher prices per unit and specific monopoly gains. 
Each of thcm watches carefully the conduct of his rivals and tries 
to adjust his own plans to their actions. A succession of moves and 
countermoves, a mutual outwitting results, the outcome of which 
depends on the personal cunning of the adverse parties. The duopolists 
and oligopolists have two objectives in mind: to find out the monopoly 
price most advantageous to the sellers on the one hand and to shift 
as much as possible of the burden of restricting the amount of sales 
to their rivals. Precisely because they do not agree with regard to the 
quotas of the reduced amount of sales to be allotted to each party, 
they do not act in concert as the members of a cartel do. 
One must not confuse duopoly and oligopoly with the incomplete 
monopoly or with competition aiming at the establishment of monop- 
oly. In thc case of incon~plete monopoly only the monopolistic group 
is prepared to restrict its sales in ordcr to make a monopoly pricc pre- 
vail; the other sellers decline to restrict their sales. But duopolists and 
oligopolists are rcady to withhold a part of their supply from the mar- 
ket. In the case of pricc dashing one group A plans to attain fuII mo- 
nopoly or incomplete monopoly by forcing all or most of its com- 
petitors, the B's, to go out of business. It cuts prices to a level which 
makes selling ruinous to its morc vulnerable competitors. A mav also 
incur losses by selling at this low rate; but it is in a position to unhergo 
such losses for a longer time than the others and it is confident that 
it will make good for them later by ample monopoly gains. This 
process has nothing to do with monopoly prices. It is a scheme for the 
attainment of a monopoly position. 
One may wonder whether duopoly and oligopoly are of practical 
significance. As a rule the parties concerned will come to at least 
a tacit understanding concerning their quotas of the reduced amount 
of sales. 

9. The monopolized good by whose partial withholding from the 
market the monopoly prices are made to prevail can be either a good 
of the lowest order or a good of a higher order, a factor of production. 
It may consist in the control of the technological knowledge required 
for production, the "recipe." Such recipes are as a rule free goods as 
their ability to produce definite effects is unlimited. They can become 
economic goods only if they are monopolized and their use is re- 
stricted. Any pricc paid for the services rendered by a recipe is al- 

Prices 361 

ways a monopoIy price. It is immaterial whether the restriction of a 
recipe's use is made possible by institutional conditions-such as 
patents and copyright laws-or by the fact that a formula is kept 
secret and other people fail to guess it. 

The complementary factor of production the monopolization of 
which can result in the establishment of monopoly prices may also 
consist in a man's opportunity to make his cooperation in the produc- 
tion of a good ltnown to consumers who attribute to this cooperation 
a special significance. This opportunity may be given either by the 
nature of the commodities or services in question or by institutional 
provisions such as protection of trademarks. The reasons why the 
consumers value the contribution of a man or a firm so highly are 
manifold. They may be: special confidence placed on the individual 
or firm concerned on account of previous experience; l5 merely base- 
less prejudice or error; snobbishness; magic or metaphysical pre- 
possessions whose groundlessness is ridiculed by more reasonable 
people. A drug marked by a trade-mark may not differ in its chemical 
structure and its physiological efficacy from other compounds not 
marked with the same label. However, if the buyers attach a special 
significance to this label and are ready to pay higher prices for the 
product marked with it, the seller can, provided the configuration of 
demand is propitious, reap monopoly prices. 

The monopoly which enables the monopolist to restrict the amount 
offered without counteraction on the part of other people can consist 
in the greater productivity of a factor which he has at his disposal as 
against the lower productivity of the corresponding factor at the 
disposal of his potential con~petitors. If the margin between the 
higher productivity of his supply of the monopolized factor and that 
of his potential competitors is broad enough for the emergence of a 
monopoly price, a situation results which we may call margin mo- 
nop01y.~" 

Let us illustrate margin monopoly by referring to its most fre- 
quent instance in present-day conditions, the power of a protective 
tariff to generate a monopoly price under special circumstances. 
Atlantis puts a tariff t on the importation of each unit of the com- 
modity p the world market price of which is s. If domestic consump- 
tion of p in Atlantis at the price s$t is a and domestic production of 
p is b, b being smaller than a, then the costs of the ~narginal dealer are 

15. Cf. below, pp. 376380, on good will. 
16. The use of this term "margin monopoly" is, like that of any other, quite 
optional. It would be vain to object that every other monopoly which results in 
monopoly prices could also be called a margin monopoly. 

Human Action 
s + t. The domestic plants are in a position to sell their total output at 
the price s + t. The tariff is effective and offers to domestic business 
the incentive to expand the prod~~ction 

of p frorn b to a quantity 
slightly smaller than a. But if b is greater than a, things are different. 
If we assume that h is so large that even at the price s domestic con- 
sumption lags behind it and the surplus must be exported and sold 
abroad, the imposition of a tariff does not affect the price of p. Both 
the domestic and the world market price of p remain unchanged. 
However the tariff, in discriminating between domestic and foreign 
production of p, accords to the domestic plants a privilege which 
can be used for a monopolistic combine, provided certain further 
conditions are present. If it is possible to find within the margin be- 
tween s + t and s a monopoly price, it becomes lucrative for the 
domestic enterprises to form a cartel. The cartel sells in the home 
market of Atlantis at a monopoly price and disposes of the surpluz 
abroad at the world market price. Of course, as the quantity of p 
offered at the world market increases as a consequence of ;he re-
striction of the quantity sold in Atlantis, the world market price drops 
from s to s,. It is therefore a further requirement for the emergence 
of the domestic monopoly price that the total restriction in proceeds 
resulting from this fa11 in the world market price is not so great as 
to absorb the whole monopoly gain of the domestic cartel. 

In the long run such a national cartel cannot preserve its monopo- 
listic position if entrance into its branch of production is free to 
newcomers. The monopolized factor the services of which the cartel 
restricts (as far as the domestic market is concerned) for the sake of 
monopoly prices is a geographical condition which can easily be 
duplicated by every new investor who establishes a new plant within 
the borders of Atlantis. Under modern industrial conditions, thc 
characteristic feature of which is steady technological progress, the 
latest plant will as a rule be more efficient than the older plants and 
produce at lower average costs. The incentive to prospective new- 
comers is therefore twofoid. it consists not oniy in the monopoiy gain 
of the cartel members, but also in the possibility of outstripping 
them by lower costs of production. 

Here again institutions come to the aid of the old firms that form 
the cartel. The patents give them a legal monopoly which nobody 
may infringe. Of course, only some of their production processes 
may be protected by patents. But a competitor who is prevented 
from resorting to these processes and to the production of the articles 
concerned may be handicapped in such a serious way that he cannot 
consider entrance into the field of the cartelized industry. 


Prices 363 

The owner of a patent enjoys a legal monopoly which, other condi- 
tions being propitious, can be used for the attainment of monopoly 
prices. Beyond the field covered by the patent itself a patent may 
render auxiliary services in the establishment and preservation of mar- 
gin monopoly where the primary institutional conditions for the emer- 
gence of such a monopoly prevail. 

We may assume that some world cartels would exist even in the 
absence o'f any government interference which provides for other 
commodities the indispensable conditions required for the construc- 
tion of a monopolistic combine. There are some commodities, e.g., 
diamonds and mercury, the supply of which is by nature limited to 
a few sources. The owners of these resources can easily be united for 
concerted action. But such cartels would play only a minor role in 
the setting of world production. Their economic significance would 
be rather small. The important place that cartels occupy in our time 
is an outcome of the interventionist policies adopted by the govern- 
ments of all countries. The great monopoly problem mankind has to 
face today is not an outgrowth of the operation of the market econ- 
omy. It is a product of purposive action on the part of governments. 
It is not one of the evils inherent in capitalism as the demagogues 
trumpet. It is, on the contrary, the fruit of policies hostile to capitalism 
and intent upon sabotaging and destroying its operation. 

The classical country of the cartels was Germany. In the last dccadcs 
of the nineteenth century the German Reich embarked upon a vast 
scheme of Sozialpolitik. The idea was to raise the income and the 
standard of living of the wage-earners by various measures of what 
is called prolabor legislation, by the much glorified Bismarck plan of 
social security, and by labor-union pressure and compulsion for the 
attainment of higher wage rates. The advocates of this policy defied 
thc warnings of the economists. There is no such thing as economic 
law, they announced. The HohenzolIern Empire which had defeated 
the Emperors of Austria and of France and before which the nations 
of the world trembled was above any law. Its will was the supreme 
canon. 

In stark reality the Sozialpolitik raised costs of production within 
Germany. Every progress of the alleged prolabor legislation and 
every successful strike disarranged industrial conditions to the dis- 
advakage of the German enterprises. It made it harder for them to 
outdo foreign competitors for whom the domestic events of Germany 
did not raise costs of production. If the Germans had been in a posi- 
tion to renounce the export of manufactures and to produce only for 
the domestic market, the tariff could have sheltered the German 


Human Action 

plants against the intensified competition of foreign business. They 
wouId have been in a position to reap higher prices. What the wage 
earner would have profited from the achievements of the legislature 
and the unions, would have been absorbed by the higher prices he 
would have had to pay for the articles he bought. Real wage rates 
would have risen only to the extent the entrepreneurs could improve 
technological procedures and thereby increase the productivity of 
labor. The tariff would have rendered the Sozialpolitik harmless in 
preventing a spread of unemployment. 

But Germany is, and was already at the time Bismarck inaugurated 
his prolabor policy, a predominantly industrial country. Its plants 
exported a considerable part of their total output. These exports 
enabled the Germans to import the foodstuffs and raw materials 
they could not grow in their own country, comparatively over- 
populated and poorly endowed with natural resources as it was. As 
has been pointed out above, such a surplus production renders a 
protective tariff ineffective. Only cartels could free Germany from 
the catastrophic consequences of its "progressive" prolabor policies. 
The cartels charged monopoly prices at home and sold abroad at 
cheaper prices. The cartels are the necessary accompaniment and 
upshot of a "progressive" labor policy as far as it affects industries 
dependent on foreign markets. The carteIs do not, of course, safe- 
guard for the wage earners the illusory social gains which the labor 
politicians and the union leaders them. There is no means 
of raising wage rates for all those eager to earn wages above the 
height determined by the productivity of each kind of labor. What 
the cartels achieved was merely to counterbalance the apparent 
gains in nominal wage rates by corresponding increases in domestic 
commodity prices. But the most disastrous effect of minimum wage 
rates, permanent mass unemployment, was at first avoided. 

Germany was not the first country that resorted to "prolabor" legis- 
lation and gave its labor unions a free hand to enforce rninimum wage 
rates. Other countries had preceded Germany in this respect. it 
the oppositon w-hich these policies had encountered on the part of 
economists, reasonable statesmen, and businessmen had for many 
years put a check upon the progress of these destructive methods of 
goternment. For the most part their alleged benefits did not grant 

.. 

the wage earners more than they had already won, without any inter- 
ference on the part of the government, by the technological improve- 
ments which never cease under capitalism. When in some cases the 
government had gone a little farther, the propulsive evolution of 
business in a very short time ~nade things even. Rut in later years, 


Prices 365 

especially after the end of the first World War, all other nations 
adopted for their labor poIicies the thorough methods of the Germans. 
Again the cartel had to supplement the "prolabor" policies in order 
to conceal their futility and to postpone for a time their manifest 
fiasco. 

With all industries which cannot content themselves with the 
domestic markct and are intent upon selling a part of their output 
abroad the function of the tariff, in this age of government inter- 
ference with business, is to enable the establishment of domestic mo- 
nopoly prices. Whatever the purpose and the effects of tariffs may 
have been in the past, as soon as an exporting country embarks upon 
measures designed to increase the re~venues of the wage earners or the 
farmers above the potential market rates, it must foster schemes which 
result in domestic nlonopoly prices for the comn~odities concerned. 
A national government's might is Iimited to the territory subject to its 
sovereignty. It has the power to raise domestic costs of production. 
It does not have the,power to force foreigners to pay correspondingly 
higher prices for the products. If exports are not to be discontinued, 
they must be subsidized. The subsidy can be paid openly by the 
treasury or its burden can be imposed upon the consumers by the 
cartel's monopoly prices. 

The advocates of government interference with business ascribe to 
the "State" the power to benefit certain groups within the framework 
of the market by a mere fiat. In fact this power is the government's 
power to foster monopolistic combines. The monopoly gains are the 
funds out of which the "social gains" are financed. As far as these 
monopoly gains do not suffice, the various measures of intervention- 
ism immediately paralyze the operation of the market; mass unem-
ployment, depression, and capital consumption appear. This explains 
the eagerness of all contemporary governments to foster monopoly 
in all those sectors of the market which are in some way or other 
connected with export trade. 

If a government does not or cannot succeed in attaining its mo- 
nopoIistic aims indirectly, it resorts to direct action. In the field of 
coal and potash the Imperial Government of Germany established 
compulsory cartels. The American New Deal was prevented by the 
opposition of business from organking the nation's great industries 
on an obligatory carte1 basis. It succeeded better in some vital branches 
of farming with measures designed to restrict output for the sake 
of monopoly prices. A long series of agreements concluded between 
the world's most prominent governments aimed at the establishment 
of world-market monopoly prices for various raw materials and food- 


Human Action 

stuffs.17 It is the avowed purpose of the United Nations to continue 
these plans. 

It is necessary to view this promonopoly policy of the contempo- 
rary governments as a uniform phenomenon in order to discern the 
reasons which motivated it. From the catalIactic point of view these 
monopolies are not uniform. The contractual cartels into which entre- 
preneurs enter in taking advantage of the incentive offered by pro- 
tective tariffs are instances of margin monopoly. Where the govern- 
ment directly fosters monopoly prices we are faced with instances of 
license monopoly. The factor of production by the restriction of the 
use of which the monopoly price is brought about is the license 
which the laws make a requisite for supplying the consumers. 

Such licenses may be granted in different ways: 

(a) An unlimited license is granted to practically every applicant. 
This amounts to a state of affairs under which no license at all is re- 
quired. 
(b) Licenses are granted only to selected applicants. Competition 
is restricted. However, monopoly prices can emerge only if the 
licensees act in concert and the configuration of demand is propi- 
tious. 
(c) There is only one licensee. The licensee, e.g:, the holder of 
a patent or a copyright, is a monopolist. If the configuration of the 
demand is propitious and if the licensee wants to reap monopoly pins, 
he can ask monopoly prices. 
(d) The licenses granted are limited. They confer upon the licensee 
only the right to produce or to sell a definite quantity, in order to 
prevent him from disarranging the authority's schen~e. The authority 
itself directs the establishment of monopoly prices. 
Finally there arc thc instances in which a government estabIishes a 
monopoly for fiscaI purposes. The monopoly gains go to the treas- 
ury. Many European governments have instituted tobacco monop- 
olies. Others have monopolized salt, matches, telegraph and telephone 
service, broadcasting, and so on. Without exception every country 
has a government n~onopoly of the postal service. 

10.Margin monopoly need not always owe its appearance to an 
institutional factor such as tariffs. It can also be produced by sufficient 
differences in the fertility or productivity of some factors of produc- 
tion. 
It has already been said that it is a serious blunder to speak of a land 
monopoly and to rcfer to monopoly prices and monopoly gains in 

17. A collection of these agreements was published in 1943by the International 
Labor Office under the title intergovernmental Comodity Control Agreements. 

Prices 367 

explaining the prices of agricultural products and the rent of land. 
As far as history is confronted with instances of monopoly prices 
for agricultural products, it was license monopoly fostered by govern- 
ment decree. However the acknowledgment of these facts does not 
mean that differences in the fertility of the soil could never bring about 
monopoly prices. If the difference'between the fertility of the poorest 
soil still tilled and the richest fallow fields available for an expansion 
of production were so great as to enable the owners of the already 
exploited soil to find an advantageous monopoly price within this 
margin, they could consider restricting production by concerted 
action in order to reap monopoly prices. But it is a fact that physical 
conditions in agriculture do not comply with these requirements. 
It is precisely on account of this fact that farmers longing for mo- 
nopoly prices do not resort to spontaneous action but ask for the in- 
terference of governments. 

In various branches of mining conditions are often more propitious 
for the emergence of monopoly prices based on margin monopoly. 

r I. It has been asserted again and again that the economies of big- 
scale production have generated a tendency toward monopoly prices 
in the processing industries. Such a monopoly would be called in our 
terminology a margin monopoly. 

Before entering into a discussion of this topic one must clarifv the 
role an increase or decrease in the unit's average cost of production 
plays in the considerations of a monopolist searching for the most 
advantageous monopoly price. We consider a case in which the owner 
of a monopolized complementary factor of production, e.g., a patent, 
at the same time manufactures the product p. If the average cost of 
production of one unit of p, without any regard to the patent, de- 
creases with the increase in the quantity produced, the monopolist 
must weigh this against the gains expected from the restriction of 
output. If on the other hand cost of production per unit decreases 
with the restriction of total production, the incentive to embark upon 
monopolistic restraint is augmented. It is obvious that the mere fact 
that big-scale production tends as a nile to lower average costs of 
production is in itself not a factor driving toward the emergence 
of monopoly prices. It is rather a checking factor. 

What those who blame the economies of big-scale production for 
the spread of monopoly prices are trying to say is that the higher 
efficiency of big-scale production makes it difficult or even impossible 
for small-scale plants to compete successfuIly. A big-scale plant could, 
they believe, resort to monopoly prices with impunity because small 
business is not in a position to challenge its monopoly. Now, it is cer- 


Human Action 

tainly true that in many branches of the processing industries it would 
be foolish to enter the market with the high-cost products of smal1, 
inadequate plants. A modern cotton mill does not need to fear the 
competition of old-fashioned distaffs; its rivals are other more or less 
adequately equipped mills. But this does not mean that it enjoys the 
opportunity of selling at monopoly prices. There is competition 
between big businesses too. If monopoly prices prevail in the sale of 
the products of big-size business, the reasons arc either patents or 
monopoly in thc ownership of mines or other sources of raw material 
or cartels based on tariffs. 

One must not confuse the notions of n~onopoly and of monopoly 
prices. Merc monopoly as such is catallactically of no importance if 
it does not result in monopoly prices. Monopoly prices are conse- 
quential only because they are the outcome of a conduct of business 
defying the supremacy of the consumers and substituting the private 
interests of the monopoIist for those of thc public. They are the only 
instance in the operation of a market economy in which the distinc- 
tion between production for profit and production for use could to 
some extent be made if one were prepared to disregard the fact that 
monopoly gains have nothing at all to do with profits proper. They 
are not a part of what catallactics can call profits; they are an increase 
in the price earned from the sale of the services rendered by some 
factors of production, some of these factors being physical factors, 
some of them merely institutional. If the entrepreneurs and capitalists 
in the absence of a monopoly price constellation abstain from ex- 
panding production in a certain branch of industry because the op- 
portunities offered to them in other branches are more attractive, they 
do not act in defiance of the wants of the consumers. On the contrary, 
they follow precisely the line indicated by the denland as expressed 
on the market. 

The political bias which has obfuscated the discussion of the mo-
nopoly problem has neglected to pay attention to the essential issues 

9rices

first of all raise the question of what obstacles restram people from 
challcnging the monopoIists. In answering this question one discovers 
the role played in the emergence of monopoly prices by institutional 
factors. It is nonsense to spcak of conspiracy with regard to the 
deals between American firms and German cartels. If an American 
wanted to manufacture an article protected by a patent owned by 
Germans, he was compelled by the American law to come to an ar- 
rangement with German business. 

I 2. A special case is what may be called the failure monopoly. 


Prices 

In the past capitalists invested funds in a plant designed for the 
production of the article p. Later events proved the investment ;I 
failure, The prices which can be obtained in selling p are so low that 
the capital invested in the plant's inconvertible equipment does not 
yield a return. It is lost. However, these prices arc high enough to 
yield a reasonable return for the variable capital to be employed for 
the current production of p. If the irrevocable loss of the capital in- 
vested in the inconvertible equipment is written off on the books and 
all corresponding alterations arc made in the accounts, the reduced 
capital working in the conduct of the business is by and large so 
profitable that it wouId be a new mistake to stop production alto- 
gether. The plant works at full capacity producing the quantity q of p 
and selling the unit at the price s. 

But conditions may be such that it is possible for the enterprise 
to reap a monopoly gain by restricting output to q/2 and selling the 
unit of p at the price 3 s. Then the capital invested in the inconvertible 
equipment no longer appears completely lost. It yields a modest re- 
turn, namely, the monopoly gain. 

This enterprise now sells at monopoly prices and reaps monopoly 
gains although the total capital invested yields little when compared 
with what the investors would have earked if they had invested in 
other lines of business. The enterprise withholds from the market 
the services which the unused production capacity of its durable 
equipment could render and fares better than it would by producing 
at full capacity. It defies the order3 of the public. The public would 
have been in better position if the investors had avoided the mistake 
of immobilizing a part of their capital in the production of p. They 
would, of course, not get any p. But they would instead obtain those 
articles which they miss now because the capital required for their 
production has been wasted in the construction of an aggregate for 
the production of p. However, as things are now after this irreparable 
fault has been committed, the%. want to get more of p and are ready 
to pay for it what is now its potential competitive market price, 
namely, s. They do not approve, as conditions are now, the action of 
the enterprise in withholding an amount of variable capital from 
employment for the production of p. This amount certainly does not 
remain unused. It goes into other lines of business and produces there 
something else, namely. m. But as conditions are now, the consumers 
would prcfer an increase of thc available quantity of p to an increase 
in the available quantity of 727. The proof is that inthe absence of a mo- 
nopoIistic restriction of the capacity for the production of p, as it is 
under given conditions, the profitability of a production of the quan- 


Human Action 
tityq of s would be such that it would pay better than an increase in the 
quantity of the article 7n produced. 
There arc two distinctive features of this case. First, the monopoly 
prices paid by the buyers are still lower than the total cost of produc- 
tion of p would be if full account is taken of the whole input of the 
investors. Second, the monopoly gains of the firm are so small that 
they do not make the total venture appear a good investment. It re- 
mains malinvestment. It is precisely this fact: that constitutes the mo- 
nopolistic position of the firm. No outsider wants to enter its field of 
entrepreneurial activity because the production of p results in losses. 
Failure monopoly is by no means a merely academic construction. 
It is, for instance, actual today in the case of some railroad companies. 
But one must guard against the mistake of interpreting every instance 
of unused production capacity as a failure monopoly. Even in the 
absence of monopoly it may be more profitable to employ variable 
capital for other purposes instead of expanding a firm's production 
to the limit fixed by the capacity of its durable inconvertible equip- 
ment; then the output restriction complies precisely with the state 
of the competitive market and the wishes of the public. 

13. Local monopolies are, as a rule, of institutional origin. But 
there are also local monopolies which originate out of conditions of the 
unhampered market. Often the institutional monopoly is designed to 
deaI with a monopoly which came into existence or would be likely to 
come into existence without any authoritarian interference with the 
market. 
A catallactic classification of local monopolies must distinguish 
three groups: margin monopoIy, limited-space monopoly and license 
monopoly. 

A local margin monopoly is characterized by the fact that the barricr 
preventing outsiders from competing on the local market and break- 
ing the monopoly of the local sellers is the comparative height of 
transportation costs. So tariffs are needed to grant limited protection

the production of bricks against the competition of far distant tile 
works. The costs of transportation provide them with a margin in 
which, the configuration of demand being propitious, an advantageous 
monopob price can be found. 

So far'local margin monopolies do not differ catallactically from 
other instances of margin monopoly. What distinguishes them and 
makes it necessary to deal with them in a special way is their relation 
to the rent of urban land on the one hand and their relation to city 
development on the other. 


Prices 371 

Let us assume that an area A offering favorable conditions for the 
aggregation of an increasing urban population is subject to monopoly 
prices for building materials. Consequently building costs are higher 
than they would be in the absence of such a monopoly. But there is 
no reason for those weighing the pros and cons of choosing the loca- 
tion of their homes and their workshops in A to pay higher prices for 
the purchase or the renting of such houses and workshops. These 
prices are determined on the one hand hy the corresponding prices in 
other areas and on the other by the advantages which settling in A 
offers when compared with settling somewhere else. The higher ex- 
penditure required for construction does not affect these prices; 
its incidence falls upon the yield of land. The burden of the mo- 
nopoly gains of the sellers of building materials falls on the owners of 
the urban soil. These gains absorb proceeds which in their absence 
would go to these owners. Even in the-not very likely-case that 
the demand for houses and workshops is such as to make it possible for 
the owners of the land to attain monopoly prices in selling and leasing, 
the monopoIy prices of the building materials would affect only the 
proceeds of the landowners, not the prices to be paid by the buyers or 
tenants. 

The fact that the burden of the monopoly gains reverts to the price 
of urban employment of the land does not mean that it does not 
check the growth of the city. It postpones the employment of the 
peripheral land for the expansion of the urban settlement. The instant 
at which it becomes advantageous for the owner of a piece of suburban 
land to withdraw it from agricultural or other nonurban employ- 
ment and to use it for urban development appears at a later date. 

Now arresting a city's development is a two-edged action. Its 
usefulness for the monopolist is ambiguous. He cannot know whether 
future conditions will be such as to attract more people to A, the only 
market for his products. One of the attractions a city offers to new- 
comers is its bigness, the multitude of its population. Industry and 
commerce tend toward centers. If the monopolist's action delays the 
growth of the urban community, it may direct the stream toward 
other places. An opportunity may be missed which never comes back. 
Greater proceeds in the future may be sacrificed to comparatively 
small short-run gains. 

It is therefore at least questionable whether the owner of a local 
margin monopoly in the long run serves his own interests well by 
embarking upon selling at monopoly prices. It would oftcn bc more 
advantageous for him to discriminate between the various buyers. He 
could sell at higher prices for construction projects in the central 


Human Action 

parts of the city and at lower prices for such projects in peripheral 
districts. The range of local margin monopoly is more restricted than 
is generally assumed. 

Limited-space mompoly is the outcome of the fact that physical 
conditions restrict the field of opcration in such a way that only one 
or a few enterprises can enter it. Monopoly emerges when there is 
only one enterprise in the field or when the few operating enter- 
prises combine for concerted action. 

It is sometimes possible for two competing trolley companies to 
operate in the same streets of a city. There were instances in which 
two or even more companies shared in supplying the residents of 
an area with gas, electricity, and telephone service. But even in such 
exceptional cases there is hardly any real competition. Conditions 
suggest to the rivals that they combine at least tacitly. The narrow- 
ness of the space results, one way or another, in monopoly. 

In practice limited-space monopoly is closely connected with 
license monopoly. It is practically impossible to enter the field with- 
out an understanding with the local authorities controlling the streets 
and their subsoil. Even in the absence of laws requiring a franchise 
for the establishment of public utility services, it would be necessary 
for the enterprises to come to an agreement with the municipal 
authorities. Whether or not such agreements are to be lcgally de- 
scribed as franchises is unimportant. 

Monopoly, of course, need not result in monopoly prices. It de- 
pends on the special data of each case whether or not a monopolistic 
public utility company could resort to monopoly prices. But there 
are certainly cases in which it can. It may be that the company is 
ill-advised in choosing a monopoly-price policy and that it would bet- 
ter serve its long-run interests by lower prices. But there is no 
guarantee that a monopolist will find out what is most advantageous 
for him. 

One must realize that limited-space monopoly may often result in 
monopoly prices. In this case we are confronted with a situation in 
which the market process does not accomplish its democratic func- 
tion.18 

Private enterprise is very unpopular with our contemporaries. Pri- 

vate ownership of the means of production is especially disliked in 

those fields in which limited-space n~onopoly emerges even if the 

company does not charge monopoly prices and even if its business 

yields only small profits or results in losses. A "public utility" com-

pany is in the eyes of the interventionist and socialist pcjli&ians a 

18. About the significance of this fact see below, pp. 676678. 

Prices 

public enemy. The voters approve of any evil inflicted upon it by 
the authorities. It is generally assumed that these enterprises shouid 
be nationalized or municipalized. Monopoly gains, it is said, must 
never go to private citizens. They should go to the public funds ex- 
clusiveIy. 

The outcome of the municipalization and nationalization policies 
of the last decades was almost without exception financial failare, 
poor service, and political corruption. Blinded by their anticapital- 
istic prejudices people condone poor service and corruption and for 
a long time did not bother about the financial failure. However, this 
failure is one of the factors which contributed to the emergence of 
the present-day crisis of interventionism,'" 

14. It is customary to characterize traditional labor-union policies 
as monopolistic schemes aiming at the substitution of monopoly wage 
rates for competitive wage rates. However, as a rule labor unions do 
not aim at monopoly wage rates. A union is intent upon restricting 
competition on its own sector of the labor market in order to raise 
its wage rates. But restriction of competition and monopoly price 
policy must not be confused. The characteristic feature of monopoly 
prices is the fact that the sale of only a part p of the total supply P 
available nets higher proceeds than the sale of P. The monopolist earns 
a monopoly gain by withholding P -p from the market. It is not 
the height of this gain that marks the monopoly price situation as 
such, but the purposive action of the monopolists in bringing it about. 
The monopolist is concerned with the employment of the whole 
stock available. He is equally interested in every fraction of this 
stock. Tf a part of it remains unused, it is his loss. Xonetheless he 
chooses to have a part unused because under the prevailing configura- 
tion of demand it is more advantageous for him to proceed in this 
way. It is the peculiar state of the market that motivates his decision. 
The monopoly which is one of the two indispensable conditions of 
the emergence of monopoly prices may be-and is as a rule-the 
product of an institutional interference with the market data. But these 
external forces do not directly result in nlonopoly prices. Only if a 
second req~iirement is fulfilled is the opportunity for monopolistic 
action set. 

It is different in the case of simple supply restriction. Here the 
authors of the restriction are not concerned with what may happen 
to the part of the supply they bar from access to the market. The fate 
of the people who own this part does not matter to them. They are 
looking only at that part of the supply which remains on the market, 

rg. See below, pp. 851-853. 


3 74 Human Action 

.Monopolistic action is advantageous for the monopolist only if total 
net proceeds at a monopoly price exceed total net proceeds at the 
potential competitive price. Restrictive action is always advantageous 
for the privileged group and disadvantageous for those whom it ex- 
cludes from the market. It always raises the price per unit and there- 
fore the total net proceeds of the privileged group. The losses of the 
excluded group are not taken into account. 

It may happen that the benefits which the privileged group derives 
from the restriction of competition are much more lucrative for them 
than any imaginable monopoly price policy could be. But this is an- 
other question. It does not blot out the catallactic differences between 
these two modes of action. 

The prevailing labor-union policies are restrictive and not n~o- 
nopoly price policics. The unions are intent upon restricting the sup- 
ply of labor in their field without bothering about the fare of those 
cxcluded. They have succeeded in cvery comparativeIy underpopu- 
lated country in erecting immigration barriers. Thus they preserve 
their comparatively high wage rates. The excluded foreign workers 
are forced to stay in their countries in which the marginal produc- 
tivity of labor, and consequently wage rates, are lower. The tendency 
toward an equalization of wage rates which prevails under free 
mobility of labor from country to country is paralyzed. On the domes- 
tic market the unions do not tolerate the competition of nonunionized 
workers and admit only a restricted number to union membership. 
Those not admitted must go into less remunerative jobs or must re- 
main unemployed. The unions are not interested in the fate of thcse 
people. 

Even if a union takes ovcr the responsibility for its unemployed 
mcmbers and pays them, out of the contributions of its employed 
members, unemployment doles not lower than the earnings of the 
employed members, its action is not a monopoly price policy. For 
the unemployed union members are not the only people wronged 
by the union's policy of substituting higher rates for the potential 
lower market rates. The interests of those excluded from member- 
ship are not taken into account. 

The Mathematical Treatment of the Theory of Monopoly Prices 

Mathematical economists have paid special attention to the theory of 
monopoly prices. It looks as if monopoly prices would be a chapter of 
catallactics for which mathematical treatment is more appropriate than it 
is for other chapters of catallactics. However, the services which mathe- 
matics can render in this field are rather poor too. 


Prices 375 

With regard to competitive prices mathematics cannot give more than a 
mathematical description of various states of equilibrium and of conditions 
in the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy. It cannot 
say anything about the actions which would finally establish these equilib- 
ria and this evenly rotating system if no further changes in the data were 
to occur. 

In the theory of monopoly prices mathematics comes a little nearer to 
the reality of action. It shows how the monopolist could find out the 
optimum monopoly price provided he had at his disposal all the data re- 
quired. But the monopolist does not know the shape of the curve of de- 
mand. What he knows is only points at which the curves of demand and 
supply intersected one another in the past. He is therefore not in a position 
to make use of the mathematical formulas in order to discover whether 
there is any monopoly price for his monopolized article and, if so, which 
of various monopoly prices is the optimum price. The mathemaucal and 
graphical disquisitions are therefore no less futile in this sector of action 
than in any other sector. But, at least, they schematize the deliberations of 
the monopolist and do not, as in the case of competitive prices, satisfy them- 
selves in describing a merely auxiliary construction of theoretical analysis 
which does not play a role in real action. 

Contemporary mathematical economists have confused the study of 
monopoly prices. They consider the monopolist not as the seller of a mo- 
nopolized commodity, but as an entreprenuer and producer. However, it is 
necessary to distinguish the monopoly gain clearly from entrepreneurial 
profit. Monopoly gains can only be reaped by the seller of a commodity or 
a service. An entrepreneur can reap them only in his capacity as seller of a 
nlonopolized commodity, not in his entrepreneurial capacity. The advan- 
tages and disadvantages which may result from the fall or rise in cost of 
production per unit with increasing total production, increase or diminish 
the monopolist's total net proceeds and influence his conduct. But the 
catallactic treatment of monopoly prices must not forget that the specific 
monopoly gain stems, with due allowance made to the configuration of 
demand, only from the monopoly of a commodity or a right. It is this alone 
which affords to the monopolist the opportunity to restrict supply without 
fear that other people can frustrate his action by expanding the quantity 
they offer for sale. Attempts to define the conditions required for the 
emergence of monopoly prices by resorting to the configuration of pro- 
duction costs are vain. 

It is misleading to describe the market situation resulting in competitive 
prices by declaring that the individual producer could sell at the market 
price also a greater quantity than what he really sells. This is true only 
when two special conditions are fulfilled: the producer concerned, A, is 
not the marginal producer, and expanding production does not require 
additional costs which cannot be recovered in selling the additional 
quantity of products. Then A's expansion forces the marginal producer to 
discontinue production; the supply offered for sale remains unchanged. 


Hzlnzan Action 

The characteristic mark of the competitive price as distinguished from the 
monopoly price is that the former is the outcome of a situation under which 
the owners of goods and services of all orders are compelled to serve best 
the wishes of the consumers. On a competitive market there s no such 
thing as a price policy of the sellers. They have no alternative other 
than to sell as much as they can at the highest price offered to them. 
But the monopolist fares better by withholding from the market a 
part of the supply at his disposal in order to make specific monopoly 
gains. 

7. Good Will 
It must be emphasized again that the market is peopled by men who 
are not omniscient and have only a more or less defective knowledge 
of prevailing conditions. 

The buyer must always rely upon the trustworthiness of the seIler. 
Even in the purchase of producers' goods the buyer, although as a 
rule an expert in the field, depends to some extent on the reliability 
of the seller. This is still more the case on the market for consumers' 
goods. Here the seller for the most part excels the buyer in techno- 
logical and commercial insight. The salesman's task is not simply to 
sell what the customer is asking for. He must often advise the customer 
how to choose the merchandise which can best satisfy his needs. The 
retailer is not only a vendor; he is also a friendly helper. The public 
does not heedlessly patronize every shop. If possible, a man prefers 
a store or a brand with which he hirnself or trustworthy friends have 
had good experience in the past. 

Good wilI is the renown a business acquires on account of past 
achievements. It implies the expectation that the bearer of the good 
will in the future will live up to his earlier standards. Good will is 
not a phenomenon appearing only in business relations. It is present 
in all social relations. It determines a person's choice of his spouse 
and of his friends and his voting for a candidate in elections. Catal- 
lactics, of course, deals only with commercial good will. 

It does not matter whether the good will is based on real achieve- 
ments and merits or whether it is only a product of imagination and 
fallacious ideas. What counts in human action is not truth as it may 
appear to an omniscient being, but the opinions of peopIe liable to 
error. There are some instances in which customers are prepared to 
pay a higher price for a special brand of a compound although the 
branded article does not differ in its physical and chemical structure 
from another cheaper product. Experts may deem such conduct un- 
reasonable. But no man can acquire expertness in all fields which are 


Prices 377 

relevant for his choices. He cannot entirely avoid substituting con- 
fidence in men for knowledge of the true state of affairs. The regular 
customer does not always select the article or the service, but the 
purveyor whom he trusts. He pays a premium to those whom he 
considers reliable. 

The role which good will plays on the marltet does not impair or 
restrict competition. Everybody is free to acquire good will, and 
every bearer of good will can lose good will once acquired. Many 
reformers, impelled by their bias for paternal government, advocate 
authoritarian grade labeling as a substitute for trade-marks. They 
would be right if rulers and bureaucrats were endowed with omnis- 
cience and perfect impartiality. But as officeholders are not free from 
human weakness, the realization of such plans would merely sub- 
stitute the defects of government appointees for those of individual 
citizens. One does not make a man happier by preventing him from 
discriminating between a brand of cigarettes or canned food he pre- 
fers and another brand he likes less. 

The acquisition of good will requires not on1~ honesty and zeal in 
attending to the customers, but no less moneyeexpenditure. It takcs 
time until a firm has acquired a stcady clientele. In the interval it 
must oftcn put up with losses against which it balances expected 
later profits. 

From the point of view of the seller good will is, as it were, a neces- 
sary factor of production. It is appraised accordingly. It does not 
mattcr that as a rule the money equivalent of the good will does not 
appear in book cntries and balance sheets. If a business is sold, a price 
is paid for the good will provided it is possible to transfer it to the 
acquirer. 

It is consequently a problem of catallactics to investigate the nature 
of this pcculiar thing called good will. In this scrutiny we must dis-
tinpish three different cases. 

Case I. The good will gives to the seller the opportunitv to sell 
at monopoly prices or to discriminate among various classes of buyers. 
This does not differ from other instances of monopoly prices or price 
discrimination. 

Case 2. The good will eives to the seller merely the opportunitv to 
sell at prices corresponding to those which his competitors attain. 
If he had no good will, he would not sell at all or onlv by cutting 
prices. Good will is for him no less necessary than the business 
premises, the keeping of a well-assorted stock of merchandise and the 
hiring of skilled helpers. The costs incurred by the acquisition of 
good will play the same role as any other business expenses. They 


Human Action 

must be defrayed in the same way by an excess of total proceeds 

over total costs. 

Case 3. The seller enjoys within a limited circle of staunch patrons 
such a brilliant reputation that he can sell to them at higher prices than 
those paid to his less renowned competitors. However, these prices 
are not monopoly prices. They are not the result of a deliberate policy 
aiming at a restriction in total sales for the sake of raising total net 
proceeds. It may be that the seller has no opportunity whatsoever to 
sell a larger quantity, as is the case for example, with a doctor who is 
busy to the limit of his powers although he charges more than his 
less popular colleagues. It may also be that the expansion of sales would 
require additional capital investment and that the seller either lacks 
this capital or believes that he has a more profitable employment for 
it. What prevents an expansion of output and of the quantity of 
merchandise or services offered for sale is not a purposive action on 
the part of the seller, but the state of the market. 

As the misinterpretation of these facts has generated a whole my- 

thology of "imperfect competition" and "monopolistic competition," 

it is necessary to enter into a more detailed scrutiny of the considera- 

tions of an entrepreneur who is weighing the pros and cons of an 

expansion of his business. 

Expansion of a production aggregate, and no less increasing pro- 

duction from partial utilization of such an aggregate to full capacity 

production, require additional capital investment which is reason- 

able only if there is no more profitable investment It does 

not matter whether the entrepreneur is rich enough to invest his own 

funds or whether he would have to borrow the funds needed. AIso 

that part of an entrepreneur's own capital which is not employed in 

his firm is not "idle." It is utilized somewhere in the framework of 

the economic system. In order to be employed for the expansion of 

the business concerned these funds must be withdrawn from their 

present ernpl~yrnent.~~ 

The entrepreneur will only embark upon 
this change of investment if he expects from it an increase in his net 
returns. In addition there are other doubts which may check the 
propensity to expand a prospering enterprise even if the market 
situation seems to offer propitious chances. The entrepreneur may 
mistrust his own ability to manage a bigger outfit successfuIly. 

zo. Expenditure for additional advertising also means additional input of 
capital. 
zI. Cash holding, even if it exceeds the customary amount and is called "hoard- 
ing," is a variety of employing funds available. Under the prcvailin state of the 

B

market the actor considers cash holding the most appropriate cmp oyment of a 
part of his assets. 


Prices 379 

He may also be frightened by the example provided by once pros- 
perous enterprises for which expansion resulted in failure. 

A businessman who, thanks to his splendid good will, is in a position 
to sell at higher prices than less renowned competitors, could, of 
course, renounce his advantage and reduce his prices to thc level of his 
competitors. Like every seller of commodities or of labor he couId ab- 
stain from taking fullest advantage of the state of the market and sell at 
a price at which demand exceeds supply. In doing so he would be 
making presents to some people. The donees would be those who 
could buy at this lowered price. Others, although ready to buy at 
the same price, would have to go away emptyhanded because the 
supply was not sufficient. 

The restriction of the quantity of every article produced and offered 
for sale is always the outcome of the decisions of entreprencurs in- 
tent upon reap& the highest possible profit and avoiding losses. The 
characteristic mark of monopoly prices is not to be seen in the fact 
that the entrepreneurs did not produce more of the article concerned 
and thus did not bring about a fall in its price. Neither is it to be secn 
in the fact that complementary factors of production remain unused 
although their fuIler employment would have lowered the price of 
the product. The only relevant question is whether or not the restric- 
tion of production is the outcome of the action of the-monopolistic 
--owner of a supply of goods and services who withholds a part of 
this supply in ordcr to attain higher prices for the rest. The char- 
acteristic feature of monopoly prices is the monopolist's defiance of 
the wishes of the consumers. A competitive price for copper means 
that the final price of copper tends toward a point at which the de- 
posits are exploited to the extent permitted by the prices of the re- 
quired nonspecific complementary factors of production; the mar- 
ginal mine does not yield mining rent. The consumers are getting 
as much copper as they themselves detcrmine by the prices they 
allow for copper and all other commodities. A monopoly price of 
copper means that the deposits of copper are utiiized oniy to a smaiier 
degree because this is more advantageous to the owners; capital and 
labor which, if the supremacy of the consumers were not infringed, 
would have been employed for the production of additional copper, 
are employed for the production of other articles for which the de- 
mand of the consumers is less intense. The interests of the owners 
of the copper deposits take precedence over those of the consumers. 
The available resources of copper are not employed according to the 
wishes and plans of the public. 

Profits are, of course, also the outcome of a discrepancy between 


Human Action 
the wishes of the consumers and the actions of the entrepreneurs. If 
the entrepreneurs had had in the past better foresight of the present 
state of the market, no profits and Iosses would have emerged. Their 
competition would have already adjusted in the past-duc allowance 
being made for time preference-the prices of the complementary 
factors of production to the present prices of the products. But this 
staterncnt cannot brush away the fundamental diffcrencc bctween 
profits and monopoly gains. The cntrcprencur profits to the extent 
he has succeeded in serving the consumers better than othcr people 
have done. The monopolist reaps monopoly gains through impairing 
the satisfaction of thc consumers. 

8. Monopoly of Demand 
Monopoly prices can emerge only from a monopoly of supply. A 
monopoly of demand does not bring about a ~narket situation differ- 
ent from that under not monopolized demand. The monopolistic 
buyer-whether he is an individual or a group of individuals acting 
in concert-cannot reap a specific gain corresponding to the mo- 
nopoly gains of monopolistic sellers. If he restricts demand, he will 
buy at a lower price. But then the quantity bought will drop too. 

In the same way in which governments restrict competition in 
order to improve the position of privileged sellers, they can also 
restrict competition for the benefit of privileged buyers. Again and 
again governments have put an embargo on the export of certain 
commodities. Thus by excluding foreign buyers they have aimed 
at lowering the domestic price. But such a lower price is not a counter- 
part of monopoly prices. 

What is commonly dealt with as monopoly of demand are certain 
phenomena of the determination of prices for specific complementary 
factors of production. 

The production of one unit of the commodity m requires, besides 
the employment of various nonspecific factors, the employment of one 
unit of cach of the two absolutely specific factors a and b. Neither a 
nor b can be replaced by any other factor; on the other hand a is of 
no use whcn not cotnbined with b and vice versa. The available suppIy 
of a by far exceeds the available supply of b. It is therefore not pos- 
sible for the owners of n to attain any price for a. The demand for a 
always lags behind the supply; a is not an economic good. If a is a 
mineral deposit the extraction of which requires the use of capital 
and labor, the ownership of the deposits does not yield a royalty. 
There is no mining rcnt. 


Prices 

But if the owners of a form a cartel, they can turn the tables. They 
can restrict the supply of a offered for sale to such a fraction that 
the supply of b exceeds the supply of a. Now a becomes an economic 
good for which prices are paid while the price of b dwindles to zero. 
If thcn the owners of b react by forming a cartel too, a price struggle 
develops between the two monopolistic combines about the outcome 
of which catallactics can bake no statements. As has already been 
pointed out, the pricing process does not bring about a uniqueIy deter- 
mined result in cases in which more than one of the factors of produc- 
tion required is of an absolutely specific character. 

It does not matter whether or not the market situation is such that 
the factors a and b together could bc sold at monopoly prices. It 
does not make any difference whether the price for a lot includ- 
ing one unit of both a and b is a monopoly price or a competitive 
price. 

Thus what is sometimes viewed as a monopoly of demand turns 
out to be a monopoly of supply formed under particular conditions. 
Thc sellers of a and of b are intent upon selling at monopoly prices 
without regard to the question whether or not the price of 7n can be- 
come a monopoly price. What alone matters for them is to obtain as 
great a share as possible of the joint price which the buyers are ready to 
pay for a and b together. The case does not indicate any feature which 
would make it permissible to apply to it the term monopoly of de-
mand. This mode of expression becomes understandable, however, 
if one takes into account the accidental features marking the contest 
between the two groups. If the owners of a (or b) are at the same time 
the entreprencurs conducting the processing of m, their cartel takes 
on the outward appearance of a monopoly of demand. But this per- 
sonal union combining two separate catallactic functions does not 
alter the essential issue; what is at stake is the settlement of affairs 
between two groups of monopolistic sellers. 

Our example fits, mutatis mutandis, the case in which a and b can 
aiso be empioyed for purposes other than the production of nz,pro-
vided these other employments only yield smaller returns. 

9. Consumption as Affected by Monopoly Prices 
The individual consumer may react to monopoly prices in different 
ways. 

I. h'otwithstanding the rise in price, the individual consumer does 
not restrict his purchases of the monopolized article. He prefers to 
restrict the purchase of other goods. (If all consumers were to react 

Human Action 

in this way, the competitive price would have already risen to the 
height of the monopoly price.) 

2. The consumer restricts his purchase of the monopolized article 
to such an extent that he does not spend for it more than he would 
have spent-for the purchase of a larger quantity-under the com- 
petitive price. (If all people were to react in this way, the seller 
would not get more under the monopoly price than he did under 
the competitive price; he would not derive any gain by deviating 
from the competitive price.) 
3.The consumer restricts his purchase of the monopolized com- 
modity to such an extent that he spends less for it than he would 
have spent under the competitive price; he buys with the money thus 
saved goods which he would not have bought otherwise. (If all peo- 
ple were to react in this way, the seller would harm his interests by 
substituting a higher price for the competitive price; no monopoly 
price could emerge. Only a benefactor who wanted to wean his 
fellow men from the consumption of pernicious drugs would in this 
case raise the price of the article concerned above the competitive 
level.) 
4. The consumer spends more for the monopolized commodity 
than he would have spent under the competitive price and acquires 
only a smaller quantity of it. 
However the consumer may react, his satisfaction appears to be 
impaired from the viewpoint of his own vahations. He is not so 
well served under monopoly prices as under competitive prices. The 
monopoly gain of the selleE is borne by a monopoly deprivation of 
the buyer. Even if some consumers (as in case 3) acquire goods which 
they would not have bought in the absence of the monopoly price, 
their satisfaction is lower than it would have been under a different 
state of prices. Capital and labor which are withdrawn from the pro- 
duction of products which drops on account of the monopolistic re- 
striction of the supply of one of the complementary factors required

which would otherwise not have been produced. But the consumers 
value these other things less. 

Yet there is an exception to this general rule that monopoly prices 
benefit the seller and harm the buyer and infringe the supremacy of 
the consumers' interests. If on a competitive market one of the com- 
plementary factors, namely f, needed for the production of the con- 
sumers' good g, does not attain any price at all, although the produc- 
tion of f requires various expenditures and consumers are ready to 
pay for the consumers' good g a price which makes its production 


Prices 383 

profitable on a competitive market, the monopoly price for f becomes 
a ncccssary requirement for the production of g. It is this idea that 
~eople advance in favor of patent and copyright legislation. If in- 
ventors and authors were not in a position to make money by invent- 
ing and writing, they would be prevented from devoting their time 
to these activities and from defraying the costs involved. The public 
would not derive any advantage from the absence of monopoly prices 
for f. It would, on the contrary, miss the satisfaction it could derive 
from the acquisition of g.Z" 

Many pcople are alarmed by the recltless use of the deposits of 
minerals and oil which cannot be replaced. Our contemporaries, they 
say, squander an exhaustible stock without any regard for the com- 
ing generations. We are consuming our own birthright and that of 
the future. Now these complaints make little sense. We do not know 
whether later ages will still rely upon the same raw materials on 
which we depend today. It is true that the exhaustion of the oil de- 
posits and even those of coal is progressing at a quick rate. But it is 
very likely that in a hundred or five hundred years people will resort 
to other methods of producing hcat and power. Nobody knows 
whether we, in being less profligate with these deposits, would not 
deprive ourselves without any advantage to mcn of the twenty-first 
or of the twenty-fourth centuries. It is vain to provide for the'needs 
of ages the technoIogica1 abilities of which we cannot even dream. 

But it is contradictory if the sainc people who lament the depletion 
of some natural resources are no less vehement in indicting monopo- 
listic restraint in their present-day exploitation. The effect of monop- 
oly prices of mercury is certainly a slowing down of the rate of de- 
pletion. In the eyes of those frightened by the aspect of a future 
scarcity of mercury this effect must appear highly desirable. 

Economics in unmasking such contradictions does not aim at a 
"justification" of monopoly prices for oil, minerals, and ore. Eco- 
nomics has neither the task of justifying nor of condemning. It has 
merely to scrutinize the effects of all modes of human action. It does 
not enter the arena in which friends and foes of rnonopoly prices are 
intent upon pleading their causes. 

Both sides in this hcated controversy resort to fallacious arguments. 
The antimonopoly party is wrong in attributing to every monopoly 
the power to impair the situation of the buyers by restricting supply 
and bringing about monopoly prices. It is no less wrong in assuming 
that there prevails within a market economy, not hampered and 
sabotaged by government interference, a general tendency toward 

22. See below, pp. 676677. 

Human Action 

the formation of monopoly. It is a grotesque distortion of the true 
state of affairs to speak of monopoly capitalism instead of monopoly 
interventionism and of private cartels instead of government-made 
cartels. Monopoly prices would be limited to some minerals which 
can be mined in only a few places and to the field of local limited- 
space monopolies if the government were not intent upon fostering 
them. 

The promonopoly party is wrong in crediting to the cartels the 
economies of big-scale production. Monopolistic concentration of 
production in one hand, they say, as a rule reduces average costs of 
production and thus increases the amount of capital and labor avail- 
able for additional production. However, no cartel is needed in order 
to eliminate the plants producing at higher costs. Competition on the 
free market achieves this effect in the absence of any monopoly and of 
any monopoly prices. It is, on the contrary, often the purpose of 
government-sponsored cartelization to preserve the existence of 
plants and farms which the free market would force to discontinue 
operations precisely because they are producing at too high costs of 
production. The free market would have eliminated, for example, 
the submarginal farms and preserved only those for which production 
pays under the prevailing rnarket price. But the New Deal preferred 
a different arrangement. It forced all farmers to a proportional restric- 
tion of output. It raised by its monopolistic policy the price of agri- 
cultural products to such a height that production became reason- 
able again on submarginal soil. 

No less erroneous are the conclusions derived from a confusion of 

the economies of product standardization and monopoly. Tf men 

asked only for one standard type of a definite commodity, production 

could be arranged in a more economical way and cdsts would be 

lowered accordingly. But if people were to behave in such a manner, 

standardization and the corresponding cost reduction would emerge 

also in the absence of monopoly. If, on the other hand, one forces the 

consumers to be content with one standard type only, one does not 

increase their satisfaction; one impairs it. A dictator may deem the 

conduct of the consumers rather foolish. Why should not women 

be dressed in uniforms like soldiers? Why should they be so crazy 

about individually fashioned clothes? He may be right from the point 

of view of his own value judgments. But the trouble is that valuation 

is personal, individual, and arbitrary. The democracy of the market 

consists in the fact that people themselves make their choices and 

that no dictator has the power to force them to submit to his value 

judgments,

10. Price Discrimination on the Part of the Seller 
Both competitive prices and monopoly prices are the same for all 
buyers. There prevails on the tnarket a permanent tendency to 
eliminate all discrepancies in prices for the same commodity or 
service. Although the valuations of the buyers and the intensity of 
their demand as effective on the market are different, they pay the 
same prices. The wealthy man does not pay more for bread than the 
less wealthy man, although he would be ready to pay a higher price 
if he could not buy it cheaper. The enthusiast who would rather 
restrict his consumption of food than miss a performance of a Bee- 
thoven symphony pays no more for admission than a man for whom 
music is merely a pastime and who would not care for the concert 
if he could attend it only by renouncing his desire for some trifles. 
The difference between the price one must pay for a good and the 
highest amount one would be prepared to pay for it has sometimes 
been called consumers7 

I3ut there can appear on the market conditions which make it pos- 
sible for the seller to discriminate between the buyers. He can sell a 
commodity or a service at different prices to different buyers. He 
can obtain prices which may sometimes even rise to the point at which 
the whole consumers7 surplus of a buyer disappears. Two conditions 
must coincide in order to make price discrimination advantageous 
to the seller. 

The first condition is that those buying at a cheaper price are 
not in a position to resell the commodity or the service to people to 
whom the discriminating seller sells only at a higher price. If such 
reselling cannot be prevented, the first seller's intention would be 
thwarted. The second condition is that the public does not react in 
such a way that the total net proceeds of the seller lag behind the 
total net proceeds he would obtain under price uniformity. This 
second condition is always present under conditions which would 
make it advantageous to a seller to substitute nlonopoly prices for com- 
petitive prices. But it can also appear under a market situation which 
would not bring about monopoly gains. For price discrimination 
does not enjoin upon the seller the ncccssity of restricting the amount 
sold. He does not lose any buyer completely; he must merely takc into 
account that some buyers may restrict the amount of their purchases. 
But as a rule he has the opportunity to sell the remainder of his supply 
to people who would not have bought at all or would have bought 

23. Cf.A.MarshaI1, Principles of Economics (8thed. London,1g3o),pp. 124-
127. 

Human Action 

only smaller quantities if they had had to pay the uniform competitive 
price. 

Consequently the configuration of production costs plays no role 
in the considerations of the discriminating seller. Production costs are 
not affected as the total amount produced and sold remains unaltered. 

The most common case of price discrimination is that of physicians. 
A doctor who can perform 80 treatments in a week and charges $3 
for each treatment is fully employed by attending to 30 patients and 
makes $240 a week. If he charges the 10wealthiest patients, who to- 
gether consume 50 treatments, $4 instead of $3, they will consume 
only 40 treatments. The doctor sells the remaining 10 treatments at 
$2 each to patients who would not have expended $3 for his profes- 
sional services. Then his weekly proceeds rise to $270. 

As price discrimination is practiced by the seller only if it is more 
advantageous to him than selling at a uniform price, it is obvious that 
it results in an alteration of consumption and the allocation of factors 
of production to various employments. The outcome of discrimina- 
tion is always that the total amount expended for the acquisition of 
the good concerned increases. The buyers must provide for their 
excess expenditure by cutting down other purchases. As it is very 
unlikely that those benefited by price discrimination will spend their 
gains for the purchase of the same goods as those the other people no 
longer buy in the same quantity, changes in the market data and in 
production become unavoidable. 

In the above example the 10 wealthiest patients are damaged; they 
pay $4 for a service for which they used to pay only $3. But it is not 
only the doctor who derives advantage from the discrimination; the 
patients whom he charges $2 are benefited too. It is true they must 
provide the doctor's fees by renouncing other satisfactions. How- 
ever, they value these other satisfactions less than that conveyed to 
them by the doctor's treatment. Their degree of contentment at- 
tained is increased. 

For a full comprehension of price discrimination it is we11 to 
remember that, under the division of labor, competition among those 
eager to acquire the same product does not necessariIy impair the 
individual competitor's position. The competitors' interests are antag- 
onistic only with regard to the services rendered by the complemen- 
tary nature-given factors of production. This inescapable natural 
antagonism is superseded by the advantages derived from the division 
of labor. As far as average costs of production can be reduced by big- 
scale production, competition among those eager to acquire the same 
commodity brings about an improvement in the individual competi- 


Prices 387 

tor's situation. The fact that not only a few people but a great number 
are eager to acquire the commodity c makes it possibIe to manufacture 
it in cost-saving processes; then even people with modest means can 
afford it. In the same way it can sometimes happen that price dis- 
crimination renders the satisfaction of a need possible which would 
have remained unsatisfied in its absence. 

There live in a city p lovers of music, each of whom would be pre- 
pared to spend $2 for the recital of a virtuoso. But such a concert 
requires an expenditure greater than 2 p dollars and can therefore not 
bc arranged. But if discrimination of admission fees is possible and 
among the p friends of music n are ready to spend $4, the recital be- 
comes feasible, provided that the amount 2 (n +#) dollars is suf- 
ficient. Then n people spend $4 each and (p -n) people $2 each 
for the admission and forego the satisfaction of the least urgent need 
they would have satisfied if they had not preferred to attend the re- 
cital. Each person in the audience fares better than he would have 
if the unfeasibility of price discrimination had prevented the per- 
formance. It is to the interest of the organizers to enlarge the audience 
to the point at which thc admission of additional customers involves 
higher costs than the fees they are ready to spend. 

Things would be different if the recital would have been arranged 
in spite of the fact that none of those admitted paid more than $2. 
Thcn price discrimination would have impaired the satisfaction of 
those who are charged $4. 

The most common practices in selling admission tickets for artistic 
performances and railroad tickets at different rates are not the out- 
come of price discrimination in the catallactical sense of the term. 
He who pays a higher rate gets something appreciated more than 
he who pays less. He gets a better seat, a more comfortable traveling 
opportunity, and so on. Genuine price discrimination is present in the 
case of physicians who, although attending to each patient with the 
same care, charge the wealthier clients more than the less wealthy. It 
is present in the case of railroads charging more for the shipping of 
goods the transportation of which adds more to their value than 
for others although the costs incurred by the railroad are the same. 
It is obvious that both the doctor and the railroad can practice dis- 
crimination only within the limits fixed by the opportunity given 
to the patient and the shipper to find another solution of their prob- 
lems more to their own advantage. But this refers to one of the two 
conditions required for the emergence of price discrimination, 

It would be idle to point out a state of affairs in which price dis- 
crimination could he practiced by all sellers of all kinds of commodi- 


Hzrnzan Action 

ties and services. It is more important to establish the fact that within 
a market economy not sabotaged by government interference the 
conditions required for price discrimination are so rare that it can 
fairly be called an exceptional phenomenon. 

I I. Price Discrimination on the Part of the Buyer 
While monopoly prices and monopoly gains cannot be realized to 
the advantage of a monopolistic buyer, the case is different with price 
discrimination. There is only one condition required for the emer- 
gence of price discrimination on the part of a monopolistic buyer on 
a free market, namely, crass ignorance of the state of the market 
on the part of the sellers. As such ignorance is unliltely to last for any 
length of time, price discrimination can only be practiced if the gov- 
ernment interferes. 

The Swiss Government has established a government owned and 
operated trade monopoly for cereals. It buys cereals at world-market 
prices on foreign markets and at higher prices from domestic farmers. 
In domestic purchases it pays a higher pricc to farmers producing at 
higher costs on the rocky soil of the tnountain districts and a lower 
price-although still higher than the world-marlcet price-to the 
farmers tilling more fertile land. 

I z. The Csnnexity of Prices 

If a definite process of production brings about the products p and 
q simultaneously, the entrepreneuria1 decisions and actions are directed 
by weighing the sum of the anticipated prices of p and q. The prices 
of p and q are particularly connected with one another as changes in 
the demand for p (or for q) generate changes in the supply of q (or 
of p). The mutual relation of the prices of p and q can be called con- 
nexity of production. The businessman calls p (or q) a by-product of 

4 (or P).
The production of the consumers' good srequires the emplovment 
of the factors p and q, the production of p the employment of the 
factors a and b, and the production of q the ernplo$nent of the 
factors c and d. Then changes in the supply of p (or of q) bring about 
changes in the demand for q (or for p). It does not matter whether the 
process of producing z out of p and q is accompIished bv the same 
enterprises which produce p out of n and b and q out of c and d, or by 
entrepreneurs financially independent of one another. or by the con- 
sumers themselves as a preliminary step in their consuming. The 


Prices 389 

prices of p and q are particularly connected with one another be- 
cause p is useless or of a smaller utility without q and vice versa. The 
mutual relation of the prices of p and q can be called connexity of 
consumption. 

If the services rendered by a commodity b can be substituted, even 
though in a not perfectly satisfactory way, for those rendered by 
another commodity a, a change in the price of one of them affects 
the price of the other too. The mutual relation of the prices of a and 
b can be called connexity of substitution. 

Connexity of production, connexity of consumption, and con-
nexity of substitution are particular connexities of the prices of a 
limited number of commodities. From these particular connexities 
one must distinguish the general connexity of the prices of all goods 
and services. This general connexity is the outcome of the fact that 
for every kind of want-satisfaction, besides various more or less 
specific factors, one scarce factor is required which, in spite of the 
differences in its qualitative power to produce, can, within the limits 
precisely defined be called a nonspecific factor-namely, 
labor. 

Within a hypothetical world in which all factors of production 
are absolutely specific, human action would operate in a multiplicity 
of fields of want-satisfaction independent of one another. What links 
together in our actual world the various fields of want-satisfaction 
is the existence of a great many nonspecific factors, suitable to be 
employed for the attainment of various ends and to be substituted 
in some degree for one another. The fact that one factor, labor, is on 
the one hand required for every kind of production and on the other 
hand is, within the limits defined, nonspecific, brings about the gen- 
eral connexity of all human activities. It integrates the pricing process 
into a whole in which all gears work on one another. It makes the mar- 
ket a concatenation of mutually interdependent phenomena. 

It would be absurd to look upon a definite price as if it were an 
isolated object in itself. A price is expressive of the position which 
acting men attach to a thing under the present state of their efforts 
to remove uneasiness. It does not indicate a relationship to something 
unchanging, but merely the instantaneous position in a kaleidoscopi- 
cally changing assemblage. In this collection of things considered 
valuable by the value judgments of acting men each particle's place 
is interrelated with those of all other particles. What is called a price 
is always a relationship within an integrated system which is the com- 
posite effect of human valuations.

K 3. Prices and Income 

A market price is a real historical phenomenon, the quantitative ratio 
at which at a definite place and at a definite date two individuals ex- 
changed definite quantities of two definite goods. It refers to the 
special conditions of the concrete act of exchange. It is ultimately 
determined by the value judgments of the individuals involved. It 
is not derived from the general price structure or from the structure 
of the prices of a special class of commodities or services. What is 
called the price structure is an abstract notion derived from a multi- 
plicity of individual concrete prices. The market does not generate 
prices of land or motorcars in general nor wage rates in general, but 
prices for a certain piece of land and for a certain car and wage rates 
for a performance of a certain kind. It does not make any difference 
for the pricing process to what class the things exchanged are to be 
assigned from any point of view. However they may differ in other 
regards, in the very act of exchange they are nothing but commodities, 
i.e., things valued on account of their power to remove felt uneasiness. 

The market does not create or determine incomes. It is not a process 
of income formation. If the owner of a piece of land and the worker 
husband the physical resources concerned, the land and the man mi11 
renew and preserve their pourer to render services; the agricultural 
and urban land for a practically indefinite period, the man for a num- 
ber of years. If the market situation for these factors of production 
does not deteriorate, it will be possible in the future too to attain a 
price for their productive employment. Land and working power can 
be considered as sources of income if they are deaIt with as such, that 
is, if their capacity to produce is not prematurely exhausted by reck- 
less exploitation. It is provident restraint in the use of factors of pro- 
duction, not their natural and physical properties, which convert 
them into somewhat durable sources of income. There is in nature 
no such thing as a stream of income. Income is a category of action; 
it is the outcome of careful economizing of scarce factors. This is still 
more obvious in the case of capital goods. The produced factors of 
production are not permanent. Although some of them may have a 
life of many years, all of them eventually become uscless through 
wear and tear, sometimes even by the mere passing of time. They 
become durable sources of income only if their owners treat them 
as such. Capital can be preserved as a source of income if the con- 
sumption of its products, market conditions remaining unchanged, is 
restricted in such a way as not to impair the replacement of the worn 

out parts. 


Prices 391 

Changes in the market data can frustrate every endeavor to perpet- 
uate a source of income. Industrial equipment becomes obsolete if 
demand changes or if it is superseded by something better. Land be- 
comes useless if more fertile soil is made accessible in sufficient 
quantities. Expertness and skill for the performance of special kinds 
of work lose their remunerativeness when new fashions or new 
methods of production narrow the opportunity for their employ- 
ment. The success of any provision for the uncertain future depends 
on the correctness of the anticipations which guided it. No income 
can be made safe against changes not adequately foreseen. 

hTeither is the pricing process a form of distribution. As has been 
pointed out already, there is nothing in the market economy to which 
the notion of distribution could be applied. 

14. Prices and Production 
The pricing process directs production into those channels in 
which it best serves the wishes of the consumers as manifested on the 
market. Only in the case of monopoly prices have the monopolists 
the power to divert production, within a limited range, from this line 
into other lines to their own benefit. 

The prices detcrminc which of the factors of production should 
be employed and which should be left unused. 'She spccific factors 
of poduction are employed only if there is no more valuable employ- 
ment available for the complementary nonspecific factors. There 
are technological recipes, land, and nonconvertible capital goods 
whose capacity to produce remains unused because their employ- 
ment would mean a waste of the scarcest of all factors, labor. While 
under the conditions present in our world there cannot be in the 
long run unemployment of labor in a free labor market, unused 
capacity of land and of inconvertible industrial equipment is a regular 
phenomenon. 

It is nonsense to lament the fact of unused capacity. The unused 
capacity of equipment made obsolete by technological improvement 
is a landmark of material progress. It would be a blessing if the estab- 
lishment of durable peace would render munitions plants unused or 
if the discovery of an efficient method of preventing and curing 
tuberculosis would render obsolete sanatoria for the treatment of 
people affected by this evil. It would be sensible to deplore the lack 
of provision in the past which resulted in malinvestmcnt of capital 
goods. Yet, men are not infallible. A certain amount of malinves&ent 


Human Action 

is unavoidable. What has to be done is to shun policies like credit ex- 
pansion which artificially foster malinvestment. 

Modern technology could easily grow oranges and grapes in hot- 
houses in the arctic and subarctic countries. Everybody would call 
such a venture lunacy. But it is essentially the same to preserve the 
growing of cereals in rocky mountain valleys by tariffs and other 
devices of protectionism while elsewhere there is plenty of fallow 
fertile land. The difference is merely one of degree. 

The inhabitants of the Swiss Jura prefer to manufacture watches 
instead of growing wheat. Watchmaking is for them the cheapest 
way to acquire wheat. On the other hand the growing of wheat is 
the cheapest way for the Canadian farmer to acquire watches. The 
fact that the inhabitants of the Jura do not grow wheat and the 
Canadians do not manufacture watches is not more worthy of notice 
than the fact that tailors do not make their shoes and shoemakers do 
not make their clothes. 

15. The Chimera of Nonmarket Prices 
Prices are a market phenomenon. They arc generated by the mar- 
ket process and are the pith of the market economy. There is no such 
thing as prices outside the market. Prices cannot be constructed 
synthetically, as it were. They are the resultant of a certain constella- 
tion of market data, of actions and reactions of the members of a 
market society. It is vain to meditate what prices would have been if 
some of their determinants had been different. Such fantastic designs 
are not more sensible than whimsical speculations about what the 
course of history would have been if Napoleon had been killed in the 
battle of Arcole or if Lincoln had ordered Major Anderson to with- 
draw from Fort Sumter. 

It is no less vain to ponder on what prices ought to be. Everybody 
ic nlensed if the price5 of things he wants to huy drop and the prices 

--r-----

of the things he wants to selI rise. In expressing such wishes a man is 
sincere if he admits that his point of view is personal. It is another 
question whether, from his personal point of view, he would be well 
advised to prompt the government to use its power of coercion and 
oppression to interfere with the market's price structure. It will be 
shown in the sixth part of this book what the inescapable consequences 
of such a policy of interventionism must be. 

But one deludes oneself or practices deception if one calls such 

wishes and arbitrary value judgments the voice of objective truth. In 

human action nothhg counts but the various individuals' desires for 


the attainment of ends. With regard to the choice of these ends there 
is no question of truth; all that matters is value. Value judgments are 
necessarily always subjective, whether they are passed by one man 
only or by many men, by a blockhead, a professor, or a statesman. 

Any price determined on a market is the necessary outgrowth of 
the interplay of the forces operating, that is, demand and suppIy. 
Whatever the market situation which generated this price may be, 
with regard to it the price is always adequate, genuine, and real. It 
cannot be higher if no bidder ready to offer a higher price turns up, 
and it cannot be lower if no seller ready to deliver at a lower price 
turns up. Only the appearance of such people ready to buy or to 
sell can alter prices. 

Economics analyzes the market process which generates commodity 
prices, wage rates, and interest rates. It does nor develop formulas 
which would enable anybody to compute a "correct" price different 
from that established on the market by the interaction of buyers and 
sellers. 

At the bottom of many efforts to determine nonnlarket prices 
is the confused and contradictory notion of real costs. If costs were 
a real thing, i.e., a quantity independent of personal valuc judgments 
and objectively discernible and measurable, it would be possible for 
a disinterested'arbiter to determine their height and thus the correct 
price. There is no need to dwell any longer on the absurdity of rhis 
idea. Costs are a phenomenon of valuation. Costs are the valuc attached 
to the most valuable want-satisfaction which remains unsatisfied be- 
cause the means required for its satisfaction are employed for that 
want-satisfaction the cost of which we are dealing with. The attain- 
ment of an excess of the value of the product over the costs, a profit, 
is the goal of every production effort. Profit is the pay-off of suc- 
cessful action. It cannot be defined without reference to valuation. 
It is a phenomenon of valuation and has no direct reIation to physical 
and other phenomena of the external world. 

Economic analysis cannot help reducing all items of cost to value 
judgments. The socialists and interventionists call entrepreneurial 
profit, interest on capital, and rent of land "unearned" because they 
consider that only the toil and trouble of the worker is real and worthy 
of being rewarded. I3owever, reality does not reward toil and trouble. 
If toil and trouble is expended according to well-conceived plans, its 
outcome increases the means available for want-satisfaction. What- 
ever some people may consider as just and fair, the only relevant ques- 
tion is always the same. What alone matters is which system of social 
organization is better suited to attain those ends for which people are 


394 Human Action 

ready to expend toil and trouble. The question is market economy, or 
socialism? Thcre is no third solution. The notion of a market economy 
with nonmarket prices is absurd. The vcry idea of cost prices is un- 
realizable. Even if the cost price formula is applied only to entrepre- 
neurial profits, it paralyzes the market. If commodities and services 
are to be sold below the price the market would have dctcrmined for 
them, supply always Jags behind demand. Then the market can 
neither determine w-hat should or should not be produced, nor to 
whom the commodities and services should go. Chaos results. 

This refers also to monopoly prices. It is reasonable to abstain from 
all policies which could result in the emergence of monopoly prices. 
But whether monopoly prices are brought about by such promo- 
nopoly government policies or in spite of the absence of such policies, 
no allkged "fact finding" and no armchair speculation can discover 
another price at which demand and supply would become equal. The 
failure of a11 experiments to find a satisfactory solution for the limited- 
space monopoly of public utilities clearly proves this truth. 

It is the very essence of prices that they are the offshoot of the 
actions of individuals and groups of individuals acting on their own 
behalf. The catallactic concept of exchange ratios and prices precludes 
anything that is the effect of actions of a central authority, of people 
resorting to violence and threats in the name of society or the state 
or of an armed pressure group. In declaring that it is not the business 
of the government to determine prices, we do not step beyond the 
borders of logical thinking. A government can no more determine 
prices than a goose can lay hen's eggs. 

We can think of a social system in which there are no prices at all, 
and we can think of government decrees which aim at fixing prices at 
a height different from that w-hich the market would determine. It is 
one of the tasks of economics to study the problems implied. How- 
ever, precisely because we want to examine these problems it is neces- 
sary clearly to distinguish between prices and government decrees. 
Prices are by definition determined-by peoples' buying and selling 
or abstention from buying and selling. They must not be confused with 
fiats issued by governments or other agencies enforcing their orders 
by an apparatus of coercion and compulsi~n.~~ 

25. In order not to confuse the reader by the introduction of too many new 
terms, we shall keep to the widespread usage of calling such fiats prices, interest 
rates, wage sates decreed and enforced by governments or other agencies of com- 
pulsion (eg., labor unions). But one must never lose sight of the fundamental 
difference between the market phenomena of prices, wages, and interest rates on 
the one hand, and the legal phenomena of maximum or minimum prices, wages, 
and interest rates, designed to nullify these market phenomena, on the other 
hand. 

XVII. INDIRECT EXCHANGE 
I. Media of Exchange and Money 
I 
I
STERPEKSONAL cxchange is called indircct exchange if, between the 
commodities and services thc reciprocal exchange of which is the 
ultimate end of exchanging, one or several media of exchange are inter- 
posed. Thc subject matter of the theory of indirect cxchange is the 
study of the ratios of exchange between the media of exchange on the 
one hand and the goods and services of all orders on thc other hand. 
The statements of the theory of indirect exchange refer to all instances 
of indirect exchange and to all things which are employed as media of 
cxchange. 

A medium of exchange which is commonly used as such is called 
money. The notion of money is vague, as its definition refers to the 
vague term "commonly used." Therc are borderline cases in which 
it cannot be decided whether a medium of exchange is or is not "com- 
monly-" used and should be called money. But this vaguencss in the 
denotation of money in no way affects the cxactitude and precision 
required by praxeological theory. For all that is to be predicated of 
money is valid for every medium of exchange. It is therefore im- 
material whether one prescrves the traditional tcrm theory of money 
or substitutes for it another tcrm. The theory of money was and is 
always the theory of indirect exchangc and of the media of cxchange.1 

2. Observations on Some Widespread Errors 
Thc fateful errors of popular monetary doctrincs which have 
Icd astray the monetary policies of almost all governments would 
hardly have come into existence if many economists had not them- 
selves committed blunders in dealing with monctary issues and did not 
stubbornly cling to them. 

Thcrc is first of all the spurious idea of the supposed neutrality of 
money.2 An outgrowth of this doctrine was the notion of the "level" 

r. The theory of monetary calculation does not belong to the theory of in. 
direct exchange. It is a part of the general theory of praxeology. 
2. Cf. above, p. 203. Important contributions to the history and termindop 
of this doctrine are provided by Hayek, Prices md Production (rev. ed. London, 
19351, pp. 1ff, 129 ff. 


Human Action 

of prices that rises or falls proportionately with the increase or cie- 
crcasc in the quantity of money in circulation. It was not realized that 
changes in thc quantity of money can ncvcr effect the prices of all 
goods and services at the same time and to thc same extent. Nor was 
it realized that changes in the purchasing power of the monetary 
unit are necessaril~ linked with changes in the mutual rclations be- 
tween tllose buying and sclling. In order to provc the doctrine that 
the quantity of moncy and prices risc and fall proportionately, rc- 
course was had in dealing with thc theory of money to a procedure 
entirely different from that modern economics applies in dealing with 
all its other problems. Instead of starting from the actions of individ- 
uals, as catallactics must do without exception, formulas w-ere con- 
structed designed to comprehend thc whole of the market economy. 
Elements of these formulas were: the total supply of money avail-
able in the Volkswirtschaft; the volume of tradc-i.e., the money 
equivalent of all transfers of conimoditics and scrvices as effected in 
the Volkswirtschaft; the average velocity of circulation of the mone- 
tary units: the level of prices. These formulas scemingly provided 
evidence of the correctness of thc pricc lcvcl doctrine. In fact, how- 
ever, this whoIe mode of reasoning is a typical case of arguing in a 
circle. For the equation of exchange already involves the level doc- 
trines which it tries to prove. It is essentiaily nothing but a rnathe- 
matical expression of the-untenable-doctrine that there is pro- 
portionality in the Inovcments of thc quantity of money and of prices. 

Tn analyzing the equation of exchange one assumes that one of its 
elements-total supply of money, volume of trade, velocity of cir- 
culation-changcs, without asking how such changes ocdur. It is 
not recognized that changes in these magnitudes do not emerge in 
the Volkswirtschaft as such, but in the individual actors' conditions, 
and that it is the interplay of the reactions of these actors that rc- 
sults in alterations of the pricc structure. The mathematical econ-
omists refuse to start from the various individuals' demand for and 
supplv of money. They introduce instead thc spurious notion of 
velocity of circulation fashioned according to the patterns of mechan- 
ics. 

There is at this point of our reasoning no need to deal with the 

question of whether or not the mathematical economists are right in 

assuming that the services rendered by money consist wholl\; or es- 

sentially in its turnover. in its circulation. E& if this were true, it 

w-ouId still be faulty to explain the purchasing power-the price-

of the monetary unit on the basis of its services. The services rendered 

by water, whi&, and coffee do not explain the prices paid for these 


Indirect Exchange 3 97 

things. What they explain is only why people, as far as they recognize 
these services, under certain further conditions demand definite quan- 
tities of these things. It is always demand that influences the price 
structure, not the objective value in use. 

It is true that with regard to money the task of catallactics is 
broader than with regard to vendible goods. It is not the task of 
catallactics, but of psychology and physiology, to explain why peo- 
ple are intent on securing the services which the various vendible 
commodities can render. Tt is a task of catallactics, however, to deal 
with this question with regard to money. Catallactics alone can tel 
us what advantages a man expects from holding money. But it is not 
these expected advantages which determine the purchasing power 
of money. The eagerness to secure these advantages is only one of 
the factors in bringing about the demand for rnoncy. It is demand, a 
subjective element whose intensity is entirely dcterrnined by value 
judgments, and not any objective fact, any powcr to bring about a 
certain effect, that plays a role in the formation of the market's ex- 
change ratios. 

The deficiency of the equation of exchange and its basic elements 
is that they look at market phenomena from a holistic point of view. 
They are deluded by their prepossession with the Volkswirtschaft 
notion. But whcre tlkre is, in the strict sense of the term, a Volksr 
wirtschaft, there is neither a market nor prices and money. On a 
market there are only individuals or groups of individuals acting in 
concert. What motivates these actors is their own concerns, not those 
of the whole market economy. If there is any sense in such notions 
as volume of trade and velocity of circulation, then they refer to the 
resultant of the individuals' actions. It is not permissible to resort to 
these notions in order to explain the actions of the individuals. 'lh 
first question that catallactics must raise with regard to changes in 
the total quantity of money available in the market system is how 
such changcs affect the vahous individuals' conduct. -~odern eco-
nomics does not ask what "iron" or "bread" is worth, but what a 
definite piece of iron or of bread is worth to an acting individual at 
a definite date and a definite place. It cannot help proceeding in the 
same way with regard to money. The equation of exchange is in- 
compatible with the fundamental principles of economic thought. 
It is a relapse to the thinking of ages in which people failed to com- 
prehend praxeological phenomena because they were committed to 
holistic notions. It is stcrilc, as were the specularions of earlier ages 
concerning the vaIuc of "iron" and "bread" in general. 

The theory of money is an essential part of the catallactic theory. 


Human Action 

It must be dealt with in the same manner which is applied to all other 
cataIIactic problems. 

3. Demand for h4oney and Supply of Money 
In the marketability of the various commodities and scrvices there 
prcvail considerable differences. There are goods for which it is not 
difficult to find applicants ready to disburse the highest recompense 
which, under the given state of affairs, can possibly be obtained, or 
a recompense only slightly smaller. There are other goods for which 
it is very hard to find a customer quickly, even if the vendor is ready 
to be content with a compensation much smaller than hc could reap 
if he could find another aspirant whose demand is more intense. It 
is these differences in the marketability of the various commodities 
and scrvices which created indirect exchange. A man who at the 
instant cannot acquire what he wants to get for the conduct of his 
own household or business, or who does not yet know what kind of 
goods he will need in the uncertain future, comes nearer to his ulti- 
mate goal if he exchanges a less markctable good he wants to trade 
against a more marlwable one. It may also happen that the physical 
properties of the merchandise he wants to give away (as, for instance, 
its perishability or the costs incurred by its storage or similar circum- 
stances) impel him not to wait longer. Sometimes he may be prompted 
to hurry in giving away the good concerned because he is afraid of 
a deterioration of its market value. In all such cases he improves his 
own situation in acquiring a more marketable good, even if this good 
is not suitable to satisfy directly any of his own needs. 

A medium of exchange is a good which people acquire neither for 
their own consumption nor for employment in their own production 
activities, but with the intention of exchanging it at a later date 
against those goods which they want to use either for consumption 
or for production. 

Money is a medium of exchange. It is the most marketable good 
which people acquire because they want to offer it in later acts of 
interpersonal exchange. Money is the thing which serves as the gen- 
erally accepted and commonly used medium of exchange. This is 
its only function. All the other functions which people ascribe to 
money are merely particular aspects of its primary and sole function, 
that of a medium of e~change.~ 

Media of exchange are economic goods. They are scarce; there is 

3. Cf. Mises, The Theory of Money and Credit, trans, by H. E. Batson (Lon- 
don and New York, 1934), pp. 34-37. 

Indirect Exchange 399 

a demand for them. There are on the rnarkct people who desire to 
acquire them and are ready to exchange goods and services against 
them. Media of exchange have value in exchange. People make sacri- 
fices for their acquisition; they pay "prices" for them. The peculiarity 
of these prices lies merely in the fact that they cannot be expressed 
in terms of money. In reference to thc vendible goods and services 
we speak of prices or of money prices. In reference to money we 
speak of its purchasing power with regard to various vendible goods. 

There exists a demand for media of exchange because people want 
to keep a store of them. Every member of a rnarkct society wants to 
have a definite amount of money in his pocket or box, a cash holding 
or cash balance of a definite height. Sometimes he wants to keep a 
larger cash holding, sometimes a smaller; in exceptional cases he may 
even renouncc any cash holding. At any rate, the immense majority 
of peoplc aim not only to own various vendible goods; they want no 
less to hold money. Their cash holding is not merely a residuum, an 
unspent margin of their wealth. It is not an unintentional remainder 
left over after all intentiqnal acts of buying and selling havc been 
consummated. Its amount is determined by a deliberate demand for 
cash. And as with all othcr goods it is the changes in the relation 
between demand for and supply of money that bring about changes 
in the exchange ratio between money and the vendible goods. 

Every piece of money is owned by one of the members of the 
market economy. The transfer of money from the control of one 
actor into that of another is temporally immediate and continuous. 
There is no fraction of time in between in which the money is not a 
pare of an individual's or a firm's cash holding, but just in "circula- 
tion." It is unsound to distinguish between circulating and idle 
money. It is no lcss faulty to distinguish bctween circulating money 
and hoarded money. What is called hoarding is a height of cash 
holding which-according to the personal opinion of an observer- 
exceeds what is deemed normal and adequate. However, hoarding 
is cash holding. Hoarded money is sciil money and it serves in the 
hoards the same purposes which it serves in cash holdings caIled nor- 
mal. He who hoards money believes that some special conditions make 
it expedicnt to accumulate a cash holding which exceeds the amount 
he himself would keep under different conditions, or other people 
keep, or an economist censuring his action considers appropriate. 
That he acts in this way influences the configuration of the demand

or planes from one place to another. But it is in this case, too, always subject to 
control. 


Human Action 
for money in the same way in which every "normal" demand influ- 
ences it. 
Many economists avoid applying the terms demand and supply 
in the sense of demand for and supply of money for cash hoIding 
because they fear a confusion with the current terminology as used 
by the bankers. It is, in fact, customary to call demand for money 
the demand for short-term loans and supply of money the supply 
of such loans. Accordingly one calls the market for short-term loans 
the moncy market. One says money is scarce if there prevails a 
tendency toward a rise in the rate of interest for short-term loans, 
and one says money is plentiful if the rate of interest for such loans is 
decreasing. These modes of speech are so firmly entrenched that it 
is out of the question to venture to discard them. But they have 
favored the spread of fateful errors. They made people confound the 
notions of money and of capital and believe that increasing the 
quantity of money could lower the rate of interest lastingly. But it is 
preciseiy the crassness of thcsc errors which makes it unlikely that 
the terminology suggested could create any misunderstanding. It is 
hard to assume that economists could err with regard to such funda- 
mental issues. 
Ofhers maintained that one should not speak of the demand for and 
supply of money because the aims of those demanding money differ 
from the aims of those demanding vendible commodities. Commodi- 
ties, they say, are demanded ultimately for consumption, while money 
is demanded in ordcr to be given away in further acts of exchange. 
This objection is no less invalid. The use which pcopIe make of a 
medium of exchange consists eventually in its being given away. But 
first of all they are eager to accumulate a certain amount of it in order 
to be ready for the moment in which a purchase may be accomplished. 
Precisely because people do not want to provide for their own needs 
right at thc instant at which they give away the goods and services 
they themselves bring to the market, precisely because they want to 
wait or are forced to wait until propitious conditions for buying ap- 
pear, they barter not directly but indirectly through the interposi- 
tion of a medium of cxchange. The fact that money is not worn out 
by the use one makes of it and that it can render its services practically 
for an unlimited length of time is an important factor in the configura- 
tion of its supply. But it does not alter the fact that the appraisement 
of money is to he explained in the same way as the appraisement of 
a1 other goods: by the demand on the part of those who are eager 
to acquire a definite quantity of it. 
Economists have tried to enumerate the factors which within the 


Indirect Exchange 

401 

whole economic system may ilcrease or decrease the demand for 
money. Such factors are: the population figure; the extent to which 
the individual households provide for their own needs by autarkic 
production and the extent to which they produce for other people's 
needs, selling their products and buying for thcir own consumption 
on the market; thc distribution of business activity and the settlement 
of payments over the various seasons of the year; institutions for the 
settlement of claims and counterclaims by mutual cancellation, such 
as clearinghouses. All these factors indeed influence the demand for 
money and the height of the various individuals' and firms' cash 
holding. But they influence them only indirectly by the role they 
play in the considerations of people concerning the determination of 
the amount of cash balances they deem appropriate. What decides 
thc matter is always the value judgments of the nien concerned. The 
various actors make up their minds about what they believe the 
adequate height of thcir cash holding should be. They carry out 
their resolution by renouncing the purchase of commodities, securi- 
ties, and interest-bearing claims, and by selling such assets or con- 
versely by increasing their purchases. With money, things are not 
different from what they are with regard to all other goods and serv- 
ices. The demand for money is determined by the conduct of people 

intent upon acquiring it for their cash holdink. 

Another objection raised against the notion of the demand for 
money was this: The marginal utility of the money unit decreases 
much more slowly than that of the other commodities; in fact its 
decrease is so slow that it can be practically ignored. With regard to 
money nobody ever says that his demand is satisfied, and nobody ever 
forsakes an opportunity to acquire more money provided the sacrifice 
required is not too great. It is therefore impermissible to consider the 
demand for money as limited. The very notion of an unlimited de- 
mand is, however, contradictory. This popular reasoning is cntirely 
fallacious. It confounds the demand for money for cash holding with 

.,

the desire for more wealth as expressed in terms of money. He who 
says that his thirst for more money can never be quenched, does 
not mean to say that his cash holding can never be too large. What 
he really means is that he can never be rich enough. If additional 
money flou7s into his hands, he will not use it for an increase of his 
cash balance or he will use only a part of it for this purpose. He will 
expend the surplus either for instantaneous consumption or for in- 
vestment. Nobody ever keeps more money than hc wants to have as 
cash holding. 

Thc insight that the exchange ratio between money on the one 


Human Action 
hand and the vendible commodities and services on the other is deter- 
mined, in the same way as the mutual cxchange ratios between the 
various vendible goods, by demand and supply was the essence of the 
quantity theory of money. This thcory is essentially an application of 
the general theory of supply and demand to the special instance of 
money. Its merit was the endcavor to explain the determination of 
money's purchasing power by resorting to the same reasoning which 
is cmployed for the explanation of all other exchange ratios. Its short- 
corning was that it resorted to a holistic interpretation. It looked at 
the total supply of money in the Volkswirtschaft and not at the 
actions of thc individual men and firn~s. An outgrowth of this errone- 
ous point of view was the idea that there prevails a proportionality 
in the changes of the-total-quantity of money and of moncy prices. 
But the older critics failed in their attempts to explode the crrors 
inherent in the quantity theory and to substitute a more satisfactory 
theory for it. They did not fight what was wrong in the quantity 
theory; they attacked, on the contrary, its nucleus of truth. They 
were intent upon denying that there is a causal relation between the 
movements of prices and those of the quantity of moncy. This denial 
led them into a labyrinth of errors, contradictions, and nonsense. 
Modern monetary theory takes up the thread of the traditional quan- 
tity theory as far as it starts from the cognition that changes in the 
pu-rchasing power of money must be dealt with according to the 
principles applied to all other market phenomena and that there 
exists a connection between the changes in the demand for and 
supply of money on the one hand and those of purchasing power on 
the other. In this sense one may call the modcrn theory of monev an 
improved variety of the quantity theory. 

The Epistemological Import of Carl Menger's Theory 
of the Origin of Money 

Carl Menger has not only provided an irrefutable praxeological theory 
of the origin of money. He has also recognized the import of his theory 
for the elucidation of fundamental principles of praxeology and its 
methods of research.5 

There were authors who tried to explain the origin of moncy by decree 
or covenant. The authority, the state, or a compact between citizens has 
purposively and consciously established indirect exchangc and moncy. The 
main deficiency of this doctrine is not to be seen in the assumption that 
people of an age unfamiliar with indirect exchange and moncy could de-

1871). pp. 25off.; ibid. (2d ed. Vienna, 19231, pp. 241 ff.; Untersuchungen iiber

Indirect Exchange 

sign a plan of a new economic order, entirely different from the real con- 
ditions of their own age, and could comprehend the importance of such a 
plan. Neither is it to be seen in the fact that history does not afford a clue 
for the support of such statements. There are more substantial reasons for 
rejecting it. 

If it is assumed that the conditions of the parties concerned are improved 
by every step that leads from direct exchange to indirect exchange and 
subsequently to giving preference for use as a medium of exchangc to cer- 
tain goods distinguished by their especiaIly high marketability, it is difficult 
to conceive why one should, in dealing with the origin of indirect ex- 
change, resort in addition to authoritarian decree or an explicit compact 
between citizens. A man who finds it hard to obtain in direct barter what 
he wants to acquire renders better his chances to acquire what he is asking 
for in later acts of exchange by the procurement of a more marketable 
good. Under these circumstances there was no need of government inter- 
ference or of a compact between the citizens. The happy idea of proceed- 
ing in this way could strikc the shrewdest individuals, and the less resource- 
ful could imitate the former's method. It is certainly more p1ausibIe to take 
for granted that the immediate advantages conferred by indirect exchange 
were recognized by the acting parties than to assume that the whole image 
of a society trading by means of money was conceived by a genius and, if 
we adopt the covenant doctrine, tnade obvious to the rest of the people 
by persuasion. 

If, however, we do not assume that individuals discovered the fact that 
they fare better through indirect exchangc than through waiting for an 
opportunity for direct exchange, and, for the sake of argument, admit that 
the authorities or a compact introduced money, further questions are 
raised.We must ask what kind of measures were applied in order to induce 
people to adopt a procedure the utiiity of which they did not comprehend 
and which was technically more complicated than direct exchange. We 
may assume that compulsion was practiced. But then we must ask, further, 
nt what time and by what occurrences indirect exchange and the use of 
money later ceased to be procedures troublesome or at least indifferent to 
the individuals concerned and became advantageous to them. 

The praxeological method traces all phenomena back to the actions of 
individuais. if conditions of interpersonal exchange are such that indirect 
exchange facilitates the transactions, and if and as far as people realize these 
advantages, indirect exchange and money come into being. Historical ex- 
perience shows that these conditions were and are present. How, in the 
absence of these conditions, people could have adopted indirect exchange 
and money and clung to these modes of exchanging is inconceivable. 

The historical question concerning the origin of indirect exchange and 
money is after all of no concern to praxeology. The only relevant thing is 
that indirect exchange and money exist because the conditions for their 
existence werc and are present. If this is so, praxeology does not need to 
resort to the hypothesis that authoritarian decree or a covenant invented 


Hunzan Action 

these modes of exchanging. The ktatists may if they like continue to ascribe 
the "invention" of money to the state, however unlikely this may be. What 
matters is that a man acquires a good not in order to consume it or to use 
it in production, but in order to give it away in a further act of exchange. 
Such conduct on the part of people makes a good a medium of exchange 
and, if such conduct beconles common with regard to a certain good, makes 
it money. All theorems of the catallactic theory of media of exchange and 
of money refer to the services which a good renders in its capacity as a 
medium of exchange. Even if it were true that the impulse for the intro- 
duction of indirect exchange and money was provided by the authorities 
or by an agreement between the members of society, the statement re- 
mains unshaken that only the conduct of exchanging people can create in- 
direct exchange and money. 

History may tell us where and when for the first time media of exchange 
came into use and how, subsequently, the range of goods employed for this 
purpose was more and more restricted. As the differentiation between the 
broader notion of a medium of exchange and the narrower notion of 
money is not sharp, but gradual, no agreement can be reached about the 
historical transition from simple media of exchange to money. This is a 
matter of historical understanding. But, as has been mentioned, the distinc- 
tion between direct exchange and indirect exchange is sharp and every- 
thing that catallactics establishes with regard to media of exchange refers 
categorially to all goods which are demanded and acquired as such media. 

As far as the statement that indirect exchange and money were estab- 
lished by decree or by covenant is meant to be an account of historical 
events, it is the task of historians to expose its falsity. As far as it is advanced 
merely as a historical statement, it can in no way affect the catallactic 
theory of money and its explanation of the evolution of indirect exchange. 
But if it is designed as a statement about human action and social events, it 
is useless because it states nothing about action. It is not a statement about 
human action to declare that one day rulers or citizens assembled in con- 
vention were suddenly struck by the inspiration that it would be a good 
idea to exchange indirectly and through the intermediary of a commonly 
used ~nedium of exchange. It is merely pushing back the problem involved. 

It is necessary to comprehend that one does not contribute anything to 
the scientific conception of human actions and social phenomena if one 
declares that the state or a charismatic leader or an inspiration which de- 
scended upon all the people have created them. Neither do such statements 
refute the teachings of a theory showing how such phenomena can be 
aclrnowledged as "the unintentional outcome, the resultant not deliberately 
designed and aimed at by specifically individual endeavors of the members 
of a society."

Indirect Exchange 

4. The Determination of the Purchasing Powcr of Money 
As soon as an economic good is demanded not only by those who 
want to use it for consumption or production, but also by people 
who want to keep it as a medium of exchange and to give it away 
at need in a later act of exchange, the demand for it increases. A new 
employment for this good has emerged and creates an additional 
demand for it. As with every other economic good, such an additional 
demand brings about a rise in its value in exchange, i.e., in the quantity 
of other goods which are offered for its acquisition. The amount of 
other goods which can be obtained in giving away a medium of ex- 
change, its "price" as expressed in terms of various goods and services, 
is in part determined by the demand of those who want to acquire 
it as a medium of exchange. If people stop using the good in question 
as a medium of exchange, this additional specific demand disappears 
and the "price" drops concomitantly. 

Thus the dernand for a medium of exchange is the composite of 
two partial demands: the demand displayed by the intention to use 
it in consumption and production and that displayed by the intention 
to use it as a medium of ~xchange.~ 

With regard to modern metalIic 
money one speaks of the industrial demand and of the monetary de- 
mand. The vaIue in exchange (purchasing power) of a medium of 
exchange is the resultant of the cumulative effect of both partial de- 
mands. 

Now the extent of that part of the demand for a medium of ex- 
change which is displayed on account of its service as a medium of 
exchange depends on its value in exchange. This fact raises difficulties 
which many economists considered insoluble so that they abstained 
from following farther along this line of reasoning. It is illogical, they 
said, to explain the purchasing pourer of money by reference to the 
demand for money, and the demand for money by reference to its 
purchasing power. 

The difficulty is, however, merely apparent. The purchasing power 
which we explain by referring to the extent of specific demand is not 
the same purchasing power the height of which determines this 
specific demand. The problem is to conceive the determination of the 
purchasing power of the immediate future, of the impending mo- 
ment. For the solution of this problem we refer to the purchasing 
pourer of the immediate past, of the moment just passed. These are 

7. The problems of money exclusively dedicated to the service of a medium of 
exchange and not fit to render any other services on account of which it would 
be demanded are dealt with beIow in section 9. 

Human Action 
two distinct magnitudes. It is erroneous to object to our theorem, 
which may be called the regression theorem, that it moves in a 
vicious circle.* 
But, say the critics, this is tantamount to merely pushing back the 
problem. For now one must still explain the determination of yester- 
day's purchasing power. If one explains this in the same way by 
referring to the purchasing power of the day before yesterday and 
so on, one slips into a regmsus in infinitzdnz. This reasoning, they as- 
sert, is certainly not a complete and logically satisfactory solution 
of the problem involved. What these critics fail to see is that the 
regression does not go back endlessly. It reaches a point at which the 
explanation is completed and no further question remains unanswered. 
If we trace the purchasing power of money back step by step, we 
finally arrive at the point at which the service of the good concerned 
as a medium of exchange begins. At this point yesterday's exchange 
vaIuc is exclusively determined by the nonmonetary-industrial- 
demand which is displayed only by those who want to use this good 
for other employments than that df a medium of exchange. 
But, the critics continue, this means explaining that part of money's 
purchasing power which is due to its service as a medium of ex- 
change by its employment for industria1 purposes. The very probIem, 
the explanation of the specific monetary component of its exchange 
value, remains unsolved. Here too the critics are mistaken. That 
component of money's vaIue which is an outcome of the services 
it renders as a medium of exchange is entirely explained by reference 
to these specific monetary services and the demand they create. Two 
facts are not to be denied and are not denied by anybody. First, that 
the demand for a medium of exchange is determined by considerations 
of its exchange value which is an outcome both of the monetary and 
the industrial services it renders. Second, that thc exchange value of 
3 good which has not yet been demanded for service as a medium of 
exchange is determined solely by a demand on the part of people 
eager to use it for industrial purposes, ix., either for consumption or 
for production. Now, the regression theorem aims at interpreting the 

8. The present writer first developed this regression theorem of purchasing 
power in the first edition of his book Theory of Money and Credit, published in 
1912 (pp. 97-123 of the English-language translation). His theorem has been 
criticized from various points of view. Some of the objections raised, especially 
those by B. Ail. Anderson in his thoughtful book The Value of Noney, first pub- 
lished in 1917 (cf. pp. loo ff. of the 1936 edition), dcscrve a very careful examina- 
tion. The importance of the problems involved makes it necessary to weight also 
the objections of H. Ellis (German Monetary TI~eory ZYOJ-~Y~~
[Cambridge, 
19341, pp. 77 ff.). In the text above, all objections raised are particularized and 
critically examined. 


Indirect Exchange 


first emergence of a monetary demand for a good which previously 
had been demanded exclusively for industrial purposes as influenced 
by the exchange value that was ascribed to it at this moment on ac- 
count of its nonmonetary services only. This certainly does not in- 
volve explaining the specific monetary exchange value of a medium 
of exchange on the ground of its industrial exchange value. 

Finally it was objected to the regression theorem that its approach 
is historical, not theoretical. This objection is no less mistaken. To 
explain an event historically means to show how it was produced by 
forces and factors operating at a definite date and a definite place. 
These individual forces and factors are the ultimate elements of the 
interpretation. They are ultimate data and as such not open to any 
further analysis and reduction. To explaina phenomenon theoretica11y 
means to trace back its appearance to the operation of general rules 
which are already comprised in the theoretical system. The regression 
theorem complies with this requirement. It traces the specific ex- 
change value of a medium of exchange back to its function as such a 
medium and to the theorems concerning the process of valuing and 
pricing as developed by the general catallactic theory. It deduces 
a more special case from the rules of a more universal theory. It 
shows how the special phenomenon necessarily emerges out of the 
operation of the rules generally valid for all phenomena. It docs not 
say: This happened at that timc and at that place. It says: This always 
happens when the conditions appear; whenever a good which has 
not been demanded previously for the employment as a medium of 
exchange, begins to be demanded for this employment, the same 
effects must appear again; no good can be employed for the function 
of a medium of exchange which at the very beginning of its use for 
this purpose did not have exchange value on account of other em- 
ployments. And all these statements implied in the regression theorem 
are enounced apodictically as implied in the apriorism of praxeology. 
It msthappen this way. Nobody can ever succeed in constructing 
a hypothetical case in which things were to occur in a different way. 

The purchasing power of money is determined by demand and sup- 
ply, as is the case with the prices of a11 vendible goods and services. 
As action always aims at a more satisfactory arrangement of future 
conditions, he who considers acquiring or giving away money is, of 
course, first of all interested in its future purchasing power and the 
future structure of prices. But he cannot form a judgment about the 
future purchasing power of money otherwise than by looking at its 
configuration in the immediate past. It is this fact that radically dis- 
tinguishes the determination of the purchasing power of money from 


Human Action 
the determination of the mutual exchange ratios between the various 
vendible goods and services. With regard to these latter the actors 
have nothing else to consider than their importance for future tvant- 
satisfaction. If a new commodity unheard of before is offered for 
sale, as was, for instance, the case with radio sets a few decades ago, 
the only question that matters for the individual is whether or not 
the satisfaction that the new gadget will provide is greater than that 
expected from those goods he would have to renounce in order to 
buy the new thing. Knowledge about past prices is for the buyer 
merely a means to reap a consumer's surplus. If he were not intent 
upon this goal, he could, if nced be, arrange his purchases without 
any familiarity with the market prices of the immediate past, which 
are popularly callcd present prices. He could make value judgments 
without appraisement. As has been mentioned already, the oblitera- 
tion of the memory of all prices of the past would not prevent the 
formation of new exchange ratios between the various vendible things. 
But if knowledge about money's purchasing power were to fade 
away, the process of developing indirect exchange and media of ex- 
change would have to start anew. It wouId become necessary to 
begin again with employing some goods, more marketable than the 
rest, as media of exchange. The demand for these goods would in- 
crease and would add to the amount of exchange value derived from 
their industrial (nonmonetary) employmcnt a specific component due 
to their new use as a medium of exchange. A value judgment is, with 
reference to money, only possible if it can be based on appraisement. 
The acceptance of a new kind of money presupposes that the thing 
in question already has previous exchange value on account of the 
scrviccs it can render directly to consumption or production. Ncither 
a buyer nor a seller could judge the value of a monetary unit if hc had 
no information about its exchange value-its purchasing power-in 
the immediate past. 
The relation between the demand for money and the supply of 
money, which may be caiicd the money reiation, deterrnincs tile 
height of purchasing power. Today's money relation, as it is shaped 
on the ground of yesterday's purchasing power, determines today's 
purchasing power. He who wants to increase his cash holding restricts 
his purchases and increases his sales and thus brings about a tendency 
toward falling prices. He who wants to reduce his cash holding 
increases his purchases-either for consumption or for production 
and investment-and restricts his sales; thus he brings about a tendency 
toward rising prices. 
Changes in the supply of money must necessarily alter the dis- 


Indirect Exchange 

409 

position of vendible goods as owned by various individuals and firms. 
The quantity of money available in the whole market system cannot: 
increase or decrease otherwise than by first increasing or decreasing 
the cash holdings of certain individual members. Wc may, if we like, 
assume that every member gets a share of the additional money right 
at the momcnt of its inflow into the system, or shares in the reduction 
of the quantity of money. But whether we assume this or not, the 
final result of our demonstration will remain the same. This rcsult 
will be that changes in the structure of prices brought about by 
changes in the supply of money available in the cconomic system 
ncvcr affect the prices of the various commodities and services to 

the same extent and at the same date. 

Let us assume that the government issues an additional quantity 
of paper money. The government plans either to b~iy commodities 
and services or to repay debts incurred or to pay interest on such 
debts. However this may be, the treasury enters the market with an 
additional demand for goods and services; it is now in a position to 
buy more goods than it could buy before. The prices of the corn- 
modities it buys rise. If the government had expended in its purchases 
money collected by taxation, the taxpayers would have restricted 
their purchases and, while the prices of the goods bought by the 
government would have risen, those of other goods would have 
dropped. But this fall in the prices of the goods the taxpayers used 
to buy does not occur if the government increases the quantity of 
money at its disposal without reducing the quantity of money in 
the hands of the public. The prices of some commodities-viz., of 
those the govcrnment buys-rise immediately, while those of the 
other commoditics remain unaltered for the time being-. But the process 
goes on. Those selling the conmodities asked for by the government 
are now themselves in a position to buy more than they used pre- 
viously. The prices of the things these people are buying in larger 
quantities therefore rise too. Thus the boom spreads from one group 
of commodities and services to other groups until all prices and wage 
rates have risen. The rise in prices is thus not synchronous with the 
various commoditics and services. 

When eventually, in the further course of the increase in the quan- 
tity of money, all prices have risen, the rise does not affect the various 
commodities and services to the same extent. For the process has 
affected the material position of various individuals to different de- 
grees. While the process is under way, some peopIe enjoy the hene- 
fit of higher prices for the goods or services they sell, while the prices 
of the things they buy have not yet risen or have not risen to the same 


4'0 Human Action 
extent. On the other hand, there are peopIe who are in the unhappy 
situation of selling commodities and services whose prices have not 
yet risen or not in the same degree as the prices of the goods they 
must buy for their daily consumption. For the former the progressive 
rise in priccs is a boon, for the latter a calamity. Besides, the debtors 
are favored at the expense of the creditors. When the process once 
comes to an end, the wealth of various individuals has been affected 
in different ways and to different degrees. Some are enriched, some 
impoverished. Conditions are no longer what they were before. The 
new order of things results in changes in the intensity of demand for 
various goods. The mutual ratio of the monev prices of the vendible 
goods and services is no longer the same as before. The price struc- 
ture has changed apart from the fact that all prices in terms of money 
have risen. The final prices to the establishment of which the market 
tends after the effects of the increase in the quantity of monep havk 
been fully consumn~ated are not equal to the previous final prices 
multiplied by the same multiplier. 
The main fault of the old quantity theory as well as the mathe- 
matical economists' equation of exchange isvthat they have ignored 
this fundamental issue. Changes in the supply of money must bring 
about changes in other data too. The market system before and after 
the inflow or outflow of a quantity of money is not merely changed 
in that the cash holdings of the individuals and prices have increased 
or decreased. There have been effected also changes in the reciprocal 
exchange ratios bctwecn the various commodities and services which, 
if one wants to resort to metaphors, are more adequately described 
by the image of price revolution than by the misleading figure of 
an elevation or a sinking of the price level. 
We may at this point disregard the effects brought about by the 
influence on the content of all defcrred payments as stipulated by 
contracts. We will deal later with them and with the operation of 
monetary events on consumption and production, investment in 
capital goods, and accumulation and consumption of capital. But 
even in setting asidc all these things, we must never forget that changes 
in the quantity of money affect prices in an uneven way. It depends 
on the data of each particular case at what moment and to what ex- 
tent the prices of the various commodities and services are affected. 
In the course of a monetary expansion (inflation) the first reaction 
is not only that the prices of some of them rise more quickly and more 
steeply than others. It may also occur that some fall at first as they are 
for the most part demanded by those groups whose interests are hurt. 
Changes in the money relation are not onIy caused by governments 


Indirect Exchange 

issuing additional paper money. An increase in the production of the 
precious metals employed as money has the same effects although, of 
course, other classes of the population may be favored or hurt by it. 
Prices also rise in the same way if, without a corresponding reduction 
in the quantity of money available, the demand for money falls be- 
cause of a general tendency toward a diminution of cash holdings. 
The money expended additionally by such a "dishoarding" brings 
about a tendency toward higher prices in the same way as that flowing 
from the gold mines or from the printing press. Conversely, prices 
drop when the supply of money falls (e.g., through a withdrawal of 
paper money) or the demand for money increases (e.g., through a 
tendency toward "hoarding," the keeping of greater cash balances). 
The process is aIways uneven and by steps, disproportionate and 
asymmetrical. 

It could be and has been objected that the normal production of the 
gold mines brought to the market may well entail an increase in the 
quantity of money, but does not increase the income, still less the 
wealth, of the owners of the mines. These people earn only their 
"normal" income and thus their spending of it cannot disarrange 
market conditions and the prevailing tendencies toward the estab- 
lishment of final prices and the equilibrium of the evenly rotating 
economy. For them, the annual output of the mines does not mean 
an increase in riches and does not impel them to offer higher prices. 
They will continue to live at the standard at which they used to 
live before. Their spending within these limits will not revolutionize 
the market. Thus the normal amount of gold production, although 
certainly increasing the quantity of money available, cannot put 
into motion the process of depreciation. It is neutral with regard to 
prices. 

As against this reasoning one must first of all obscrve that within 
a progressing economy in which population figures are increasing 
and the division of labor and its corollary, industrial specialization, 
are perfected, there prevaiis a tendency toward an increase in the 
demand for money. Additional people appear on the scene and want 
to establish cash holdings. The extent of economic self-sufficiency, 
i.e., of production for the household's own needs, shrinks and peoplc 
become more dependent upon the market; this will, by and large, 
impel them to increase their holding of cash. Thus the price-raising 
tendency emanating from what is called the "normal" gold produc- 
tion encounters a price-cutting tendency emanating from the in- 
creased demand for cash holding. However, these two opposite tend- 
encies do not neutralize each other. Both processes take their own 


Human Action 

course, both result in a disarrangement of existing social conditions, 
making some people richer, some people poorer. Both affect the prices 
of various goods at different dates and to a different degree. It is true 
that the rise in the prices of some commodities caused by one of these 
processes can finally be compensated by the fall caused by the other 
process. It may happen that at the end some or many prices come 
back to their previous height. But this final result is not the outcome 
of an absence of movements provoked by changes in the money rela- 
tion. It is rather the outcome of the joint effect of the coincidence of 
two processes independent of each other, each of which brings about 
alterations in the market data as well as in the material conditions of 
various individuals and groups of individuals. The new- structure of 
prices may not differ very much from the previous one. But it is 
the resultant of two series of changes which have accomplished all 
inherent social transformations. 

The fact that the owners of gold mines rely upon steady yearly 
proceeds from their gold production does dot cancel the newly 
mined gold's impression upon prices. The owners of the mines talie 
from the market, in exchange for the gold produced, the goods and 
services required for their mining and the goods needed for their 
consumption and their investments in other lines of production. If 
they had not produced this amount of gold, prices would not have 
been affected by it. It is beside the point that they have anticipated 
the future yield of the mines and capitalized it and that they have 
adjusted their standard of living to the expectation of steady proceeds 
from the mining operations. The effects which the newly mined 
gold exercises on their expenditure and on that of those people whose 
cash holdings step by step it enters later begin only at the instant this 
gold is available in the hands of the mine owners. If, in the expectation 
of funire yields, they had expended money at an earlicr date and the 
expected yield failed to appear, conditions would not differ from 
other cases in which consumption was financed by credit based on 
expectations not realized by later events. 

Changes in the extent ofthe desired cash holding of various people 
neutralize one another only to the extcnt that they are regularly re- 
curring and mutually connected by a causal reciprocity. Salaried 
people and wage earners are not paid daily, but at certain pay days 
for a period of one or several weeks. They do not pIan to keep their 
cash holding within the period between pay days at the same level; 
the amount of cash in their pockets declines with the approach of the 
next pay day. On the other hand, the merchants who supply them 
with the necessities of life increase their cash holdings concomitantly. 


Indirect Exchange

The two movements condition each other; there is a causal interde- 
pendence between them which harmonizes them both with rcgard to 
time and to quantitative amount. Neither the dealer nor his customer 
lets himself be influenced by these recurrent fluctuations. Their 
plans concerning cash holding as well as their business operations 
and their spending for consumption respectively have the whole 
period in view and take it into account as a whole. 

It was this phenomenon that led economists to the image of a 
regular circulation of money and to the tleglect of the changes in the 
individuals' cash holdings. However, we are faced with a concatena- 
tion which is limited to a narrow, neatly circumscribed field. Only 
as far as the increase in the cash holding of one group of people is 
ten~porally and quantitatively related to the decrease in the cash 
holding of another group and as far as these changes are self-liquidating 
within the course of a period which the members of both groups 
consider as a whole in planning their cash holding, can thc neutraliza- 
tion take place. Beyond this fieId there is no question of such a 
neutralization. 

5. The Problem of Hume and Mi11 and the Driving 
Force of Money 
Is it possibie to think of a state of affairs in which changes in the 

purchasing power of money occur at the same time and to the same 

extent with regard to all commodities and services and in proportion 

to the changes effected in either the demand for or the supply of 

money? In other words, is it possible to think of neutral money within 

the frame of an economic system which does not correspond to the 

imaginary construction of an evenly rotating economy? We may 

call this pertinent question the problem of Hume and Mill. 

It is uncontested that neither Ilume nor Mill succeeded in finding 

-

a positive answer to this question."^ it possible to answer it cate-

gorically in the negative? 

We imagine two systems of an evenly rotating economy A and B. 

The two systems are independent and in no way connected with one 

another. The two systems differ from one another only in the fact 

that to each amount of money nz in A there corresponds an amount 

n m in B, n being greater or smaller than I; we assume that there are 

no deferred paynlents and that the money used in both systems serves 

only monetary purposes and does not allow of any nonmonetary use. 

Consequently the prices in the two systems are in the ratio I : n. Is it 

9. Cf. Mises, Theory of Money and Credit, pp. 140-142. 

Human Action 
thinkable that conditions in A can be altered at one stroke in such a 
way as to make them entirely equivalent to conditions in B? 
The answer to this question must obviously be in the negative. He 
who wants to answer it in the positive must assume that a deus ex 
nzacbina approaches every individual at the same instant, increases 
or decreases his cash holding by multiplying it by n, and tells him that 
henceforth he must multiply by n a11 price data which he employs in 
his appraisements and calculations. This cannot happen without a 
miracle. 
It has been pointed out already that in the imaginary construction 
of an evenly rotating economy the very notion of moncy vanishes 
into an unsubstantial calculation process, self-contradictory and de- 
void of any meaning.1° It is impossible to assign any function to in- 
direct exchange, media of exchange, and money within an imaginary 
construction the characteristic mark of which is unchangeability and 
rigidity of conditions. 
Where there is no uncertainty concerning the future, there is no 
need for any cash holding. As money must necessarily be kept by 
people in their cash holdings, there cannot be any money. The use of 
media of exchange and the keeping of cash holdings are conditioned 
by the changeability of economic data. Money in itself is an element 
of change; its existence is incompatible with the idea of a regular flow 
of events in an evenly rotating economy. 
Every change in the money relation alters-apart from its effects 
upon deferred payments-the conditions of the individual members 
of society. Some become richer, some poorer. It may happen that the 
effects of a change in the demand for and supply of money encounter 
the effects of opposite changes occurring by and large at the same 
time and to the same extent; it may happen that the resultant of the 
two opposite movements is such that no conspicuous changes in the 
price structure emerge. But even then the efFects on the conditions 
of the various individuals are not absent, Each change in the money 
relation takcs its own course and produces its own particular effects. 
If an inflationary movement and a deflationary one occur at the same 
time or if an inflation is temporally followed by a deflation in such a 
way that prices finally are not very much changed, the social conse- 
quences of each of the two movements do not cancel each other. To 
the social consequences of an inflation those of a deflation are added. 
There is no reason to assume that all or even most of those favored by 
one movement will be hurt by the second one, or vice versa. 
Money is neither an abstract numthire nor a standard of value or 

10. Cf. above, pp. 249-250. 

Indirect Exchange 4x5 

prices. It is necessarily an economic good and as such it is valued and 
appraised on its own merits, i.e., the services which a man expects 
from holding cash. On the market there is always change and move- 
mcnt. Only because there are fluctuations is there money. Money is 
an element of change not because it "circulates," but because it is 
kept in cash holdings. Only because people expect changes about the 
kind and extent of which thcy have no certain knowledge whatso- 
ever, do they keep money. 

While money can be thought of only in a changing economy, it is 
in itself an element of further changes. Every change in the economic 
data sets it in motion and makes it the driving force of new changes. 
Every shift in the mutual relation of the exchange ratios between the 
various nonmonetary goods not only brings about changes in pro- 
duction and in what is popularly called distribution, but also provokes 
changes in the money relation and thus further changes. Nothing 
can happen in the orbit of vendible goods without affecting the orbit 
of money, and all that happens in the orbit of money affects the orbit 
of commodities. 

The notion of a neutral money is no less contradictory than that 
of a money of stable purchasing power. Money without a driving 
force of its own would not, as people assume, be a perfect 
money; it would not bc moncy at all. 

It is a popular fallacy to believe that perfect money should be 
neutral and endowed with unchanging purchasing powcr, and that 
the goal of monetary policy should he to realize this perfect money. 
It is easy to understand this idea as a reaction against the stiIl more 
popular postulates of the inflationists. But it is an excessive reaction, 
it is in itself confused and contradictory, and it has worked havoc be- 
cause it was strengthened by an inveterate error inherent in the 
thought of many philosophers and economists. 

These thinkers are misled by the widespread belief that a state of 
rest is more perfect than one of movement. Their idea of perfection 
implies that no more perfect state can be thought of and consequently 
that every change would impair it. The best that can be said of a 
motion is that it is directed toward the attainment of a state of perfec- 
tion in which there is rest because every further movement would 
lead into a less perfect state. Motion is seen as the absence of equi- 
librium and full satisfaction, as a manifestation of trouble and want. 
As far as such thoughts merely establish the fact that action aims at 
the removal of uneasiness and ultimately at the attainment of fulI 
satisfaction, they are well foundcd. But one must not forget that rest 
and equilibrium are not only present in a state in which perfect con- 


Human Action 

tentment has made people perfectly happy, but no less in a state in 
which, although wanting in many regards, they do not see any means 
of improving their condition. The absence of action is not only the 
result of full satisfaction; it can no less be the corollary of the inability 
to render things more satisfactory. It can mean hopelessness as well 
as contentment. 

With the real universe of action and unceasing change, with the 
economic system which cannot be rigid, neither neutrality of money 
nor stability of its purchasing power are compatible. A world of the 
kind which the necessary requirements of neutral and stable money 
presuppose would be a world without action. 

It is therefore neither strange nor vicious that in the frame of such 
a changing world money is neither neutral nor stable in purchasing 
power. All plans to render money neutral and stable are contradic- 
tory. Money is an element of action and consequentIy of change. 
Changes in the money relation, it., in the relation of the demand for 
and the supply of money, affect the exchange ratio between money 
on the one hand and the vendible commodities on the other hand. 
These changes do not affect at the same time and to the same extent 
the prices of the various commodities and services. They conse-
quently affect the wealth of the various members of society in a dif- 
ferent way. 

6. Cash-Induced and Goods-Induced Changes in 
Purchasing Power 
Changes in the purchasing power of money, i.e., in the exchange 
ratio between money and the vendible goods and commodities, can 
originate either from the side of money or from the side of the vendi- 
ble goods and commodities. The change in the data which provokes 
them can either occur in the demand for and supply of money or in 
the demand for and supply of the other goods and services. We may 
accordingly distinguish between cash-induced and goods-induced 
changes in purchasing power. 

Goods-induced changes in purchasing power can be brought about 
by changes in the supply of commodities and services or in the de- 
mand for individual commodities and services. A general rise or fall 
in the demand for a11 goods and services or the greater part of them 
can be effected only from the side of money. 

Let us now scritinize the social and economic consequences of 

changes in the purchasing power of money under the following three 

assumptions: first, that the money in question can only be used as 


Indirect Exchange 

money-ix., as a medium of exchange-and can serve no other pur- 
pose; second, that there is only exchange of present goods and no 
exchange of present goods against future goods; third, that we disre- 
gard the effects of changes in purchasing power on monetary calcu- 
lation. 

Under these assumptions a11 that cash-induced changes in purchas- 
ing power bring about are shifts in the disposition of wealth among 
different individuals. Some get richer, others poorer; some are better 
supplied, others less; what some people gain is paid for by the loss of 
others. It would, however, be impermissible to interpret this fact by 
saying that total satisfaction remained unchanged or that, while no 
changes have occurred in total supply, the state of total satisfaction 
or of the sum of happiness has been increased or decreased by changes 
in the distribution of wealth. The notions of total satisfaction or total 
happiness are empty. It is impossible to discover a standard for com- 
paring the different degrees of satisfaction or happiness attained by 
various individuals. 

Cash-induced changes in purchasing power indirectly generate 
further changes by favoring either the accumulation of additional 
capital or the consumption of capital avaiIable. Whether and in what 
direction such secondary effects arc brought about depends on the 
specific data of each case. We shall deal with these important problems 
at a later point.ll 

Goods-induced changes in purchasing power are sometimes noth- 
ing else but consequences of a shift of demand from somc goods to 
others. If they are brought about by an increase or a decrease in the 
supply of goods they are not merely transfers from some people to 
other people. They do not mean that Peter gains what Paul has lost. 
Some people mai become richer although nobody is impoverished, 
and vice versa. 

We may describe this fact in the following way: Let A and B be 
two independent systems which are in no way connected with each 
other. In both systcms the same kind of money is used, a money which 
cannot be used for any nonmonetary purpose. Now we assume, as 
case I, that A and B differ from each other only in so far as in B the 
total supply of money is 12 nz,m being the total supply of money in 
A, and thar to every cash holding of c and to every claim in terms 
of money d in A there corresponds a cash holding of n c and a claim 
of n d in B. In every other respect A equals B. Then we assume, as 
case 2, that A and B differ from each other only in so far as in B the 
total supply of a certain commodity r is n p, p being the total supply 

11. Cf. below, Chapter XX. 

Human Actiofz 
of this commodity in A, and that to every stock v of this commodity r 
in A there corresponds a stock of n v in B. In both cases n is greater 
than I. If we ask every individual of A whether he is ready to make 
the slightest sacrifice in order to exchange his position for the cor- 
responding place in B, the answer will be unanimously in the negative 
in case I. But in case z all owners of r and all those who do not own 
any r, but are eager to acquire a quantity of it-i.e., at least one in- 
dividual-will answer in the affirmative. 
The services money renders are conditioned by the height of its 
purchasing power. Nobody wants to have in his cash holding a definite 
number of pieces of money or a definite weight of money; he wants 
to keep a cash holding of a definite amount of purchasing power. As 
the operation of the market tends to determine the final state of 
money's purchasing power at a height at which the supply of and 
the dcmand for money coincide, there can never be an excess or a 
deficiency of money. Each individual and all individuals together 
always enjoy fully the advantages which they can derive from in- 
direct exchange and the use of money, no matter whether the total 
quantity of money is great or small. Changes in money's purchasing 
power generate changes in the disposition of wealth among the various 
members of society. From the point of view of people eager to be 
enriched by such changes, the supply of money may be called in- 
sufficient or excessive, and the appetite for such gains may result in 
policies designed to bring about cash-induced alterations in purchas- 
ing power. However, the services which money renders can be 
neither improved nor impaired by changing the supply of money. 
There may appear an excess or a deficiency of money in an individ- 
ual's cash holding. But such a condition can be remedied by increas- 
ing or decreasing consumption or investment. (Of course, one must 
not fall prey to the popular confusion between the demand for money 
for cash hilding and the appetite for more wealth.) The quantity of 
money available in the whole economy is always sufficient to secure 
for everybody all that money does and can do. 
From the point of view of this insight one may call wasteful all 
expenditures incurred for increasing the quantity of money. The 
fact that things which could render some other useful services are 
employed as money and thus withheld from these other employments 
appears as a superfluous curtailment of Iimited opportunities for 
want-satisfaction. It was this idea that led Adam Smith and Ricardo 
to the opinion that it was very beneficial to reduce the cost of pro- 
ducing money by resorting to the use of paper printed currency. 
However, things appear in a different light to the students of mone- 


Indirect Exchange 

tary history. If one looks at the catastrophic consequences of the 
great paper money inflations, one must admit that the expensiveness 
of gold production is the minor evil. It would be futile to retort that 
these catastrophes were brought about by the improper use which 
the governments made of the powers that credit money and fiat money 
pIaced in their hands and that wiser governments would have adopted 
sounder policies. As money can never be neutral and stable in pur- 
chasing power, a government's plans concerning the determination 
of the quantity of money can never be impartial and fair to all mem- 
bers of society. Whatever a government does in the pursuit of aims 
to influence the height of purchasing power depends necessarilv upon 
the rulers' personal value judgments. It always furthers the interests 
of some groups of people at the expense of other groups. It never 
serves what is called the commonweal or the public weIfare. In the 
field of monetary policies too there is no such thing as a scientifir 
ought. 

The choice of the good to be employed as a medium of exchange 
and as money is never indifferent. It determines the course of the 
cash-induced changes in purchasing power. The question is only 
who should make the choice: the people buying and selling on the 
market, or the government? It was the market w-hich in a selective 
process, going on for ages, finally assigned to the precious metals 
gold and silver the character of money. For two hundred years the 
governments have interfered with the market's choice of the money 
medium. Even the most bigoted Ctatists do not venture to assert that 
this interference has proved beneficial. 

Inflation and Deflation; Inflationism and Depntionism 

The notions of inflation and deflation are not praxeological concepts. 
They were not created by economists, but by the mundane speech of the 
public and of politicians. They impIied the popular fallacy that there is such 
a thing as neutral money or money of stabIe purchasing power and that 
sound money should be neutral and stable in purchasing power. From this 
point of view the term inflation was applied to signify cash-induced 
changes resulting in a drop in purchasing power, and the term deflation to 
signify cash-induced changes resulting in a rise in purchasing power. 

However, those applying these terms are not aware of the fact that 
purchasing power never remains unchanged and that consequently there 
is always either inflation or deflation. They ignore these necessarily per- 
petual fluctuations as far as they are only small and inconspicuous, and 
reserve the use of the terms to big changes in purchasing power. Since the 
question as to at what point a change in purchasing power begins to deserve 
being called big depends on personal relevance judgments, it becomes 


Human Action 

manifest that inflation and deflation are terms lacking the categorial 
precision required for praxeoIogica1, economic, and catallactic concepts. 
Their application is appropriate for history and politics. Catallactics is free 
to resort to them only when applying its theorems to the interpretation of 
events of economic history and of political programs. Moreover, it is very 
expedient even in rigid catallactic disquisitions to make use of these two 
terms whenever no misinterpretation can possibly result and pedantic 
heaviness of expression can be avoided. But it is necessary never to forget 
that all that catallactics says with regard to inflation and deflation-i.e., big 
cash-induced changes in purchasing power-% valid also with regard to 
small changes, although, of course, the consequences of smaller changes are 
less conspicuous than those of big changes. 

The terms inflationism and deflationism, inflationist and deflationist, 

signify the poIitica1 programs aiming at inflation and deflation in the sense 

of big cash-induced changes in purchasing power. 

The semantic revolution which is one of the characteristic features of 
our day has also changed the traditional connotation of the terms inflation 
and deflation. What many people today call inflation or deflation is no 
longer the great increase or decrease in the supply of money, but its inexo- 
rable consequences, the general tendency toward a rise or a fall in com- 
modity prices and wage rates. This innovation is by no means harmless. It 
plays an important role in fomenting the popular tehdencies toward in- 
flationism. 

First of all there is no longer any term available to signify what inflation 
used to signify. It is impossible to fight a policy which you cannot name. 
Statesmen and writers no longer have the opportunity of resorting to a ter- 
minology accepted and understood by the public when they want to ques- 
tion the expediency of issuing huge amounts of additional money. They 
must enter into a detailed analysis and description of this policy with full 
particulars and minute accounts whenever they want to refer to it, and 
they must repeat this bothersome procedure in every sentence in which 
they deal with the subject. As this policy has no name, it becomes self- 
understood and a matter of fact. It goes on luxuriantly. 

The second mischief is that those engaged in futile and hopeless attempts 
to fight the inevitable consequences of inflation-the rise in prices-are 
disguising their endeavors as a fight against inflation. While merely fight- 
ing symptoms, they pretend to fight the root causes of the evil. Because 
they do not comprehend the causal relation betw-een the increase in the 
quantity of money on the one hand and the rise in prices on the other, they 
practicalIy make things worse. The best example was provided by the sub- 
sidies granted on the part of the governments of the United States, Canada, 
and Great Britain to farmers. Price ceilings reduce the supply of the com- 
modities concerned because production involves a loss for the marginal 
producers. To prevent this outcome the governments granted subsidies to 
the farmers producing at the highest costs. These subsidies were financed 
out of additional increases in the quantity of money. If the consumers had 


lndirect Exchange 421 

had to pay higher prices for the products concerned, no further inflation- 
ary effects would have emerged. The consumers would have had to use for 
such surplus expenditure only money which had already been issued pre- 
viously. Thus the confusion of inflation and its consequences in fact can 
directly bring about more inflation. 

It is obvious that this new-fangled connotation of the terms inflation and 
deflation is utterly confusing and misleading and must be unconditionally 
rejected. 

7. Monetary Calculation and Changes in Purchasing Power 
Monetary calculation reckons with the prices of commodities and 
services as they were determined or would have been determined 
or presumably will be determined on the market. It is eager to detect 
price discrepancies and to draw conclusions from such a detection. 

Cash-induced changes in purchasing power cannot be taken into 
account in such calculations. It is possible to put in the place of cal- 
culation based on a definite kind of money a a mode of calculating 
based on another kind of money b. Then the result of the calculation 
is made safe against adulteration on the part of changes effected in 
the purchasing power of a; but it can still be adulterated by changes 
effected in the purchasing power of b. There is no means of freeing 
any mode of economic calculation from the influence of changes in 
the purchasing power of the definite kind of money on which it is 
based. 

All results of economic calculation and all conclusions derived 
from them are conditioned by the vicissitudes of cash-induced changes 
in purchasing power. In accordance with the rise or fall in purchasing 
power there emerge between items reflecting earlier prices and those 
reflecting later prices specific diffcrences; the calculus shows profits or 
losses which are mercly produced by cash-induced changes effected 
in the purchasing power of money. If we compare such profits or 
losses with the result of 3 calculation accomplished on the basis of a 
kind of money whose purchasing power had been subject to less 
vehement changes, we can call them imaginary or apparent only. 
But om must not forget that such statements are only possible as a 
result of the comparison of calculations carried out in different kinds 
of money. As there is no such thing as a money with stable purchas- 
ing pourer, such apparent profits and losses are present with every 
mode of economic calculation, no matter on what kind of money it 
may be based. It is in~possible to distinguish precisely between genuine 
profits and losses and merely apparent profits and losses. 

It is therefore possible to maintain that economic calculation is 


Human Action 

not perfect. However, nobody can suggest a method which could 
free economic calculation from these defects or design a monetary 
system which could remove this source of error entirely. 

It is an undeniable fact that the free market has succeeded in de- 
veloping a currency system which well served all the requirements 
both of indirect cxchange and of economic calculation. The aims of 
monetary calculation are such that thcy cannot be frustrated by the 
inaccuracies which stem from slow and comparatively slight move- 
ments in purchasing power. Cash-induced changes in purchasing 
power of the extent to which they occurred in the last two centuries 
with metallic money, expecially with gold money, cannot influence 
the result of the businessmen's economic calculations so considerably 
as to render such calculations useless. Historical experience shows that 
one could, for all practical purposes of the conduct of business, man- 
age very well with these methods of calculation. Theoretical con- 
sideration shows that it is impossible to design, still less to realize, a 
better method. In view of these facts it is vain to call monetary cal- 
culation imperfect. Man has not the power to change the categories 
of human action. He must adjust his conduct to them. 

Businessmen never dcemed it necessary to free economic calcula- 
tion in terms of gold from its dependence on the fluctuations in pur- 
chasing power. The proposals to improve the currency system by 
adopting a tabular standard based on index numbers or by adopting 
various methods of commodity standards were not advanced with 
regard to business transactions and to monetary calculation. Their 
aim was to provide a less fluctuating standard for long-run loan 
contracts. Businessmen did not even consider it expedient to modify 
their accounting methods in those regards in which it would have been 
easy to narrow down certain errors induced by fluctuations in pur- 
chasing power. It would, for instance, have been possible to discard 
the practice of writing off durable equipment by means of yearly 
depreciation quotas, invariably fixed in a percentage of the cost of 
its acquisition. In its place one could resort to the device of laying 
aside in renewal funds as much as seems necessary to provide the full 
costs of the replacement at the time when it is required. But business 
was not eager to adopt such a procedure. 

All this is valid only with regard to money which is not subject 
to rapid, big cash-induced changes in purchasing power. But money 
with which such rapid and big changes occur loses its suitability to 
serve as a medium of exchange altogether.

8. The Anticipation of Expected Changes in 
Purchasing Power 
The deliberations of the individuals which determine their con-
duct with regard to money are based on their knowledge concerning 
the prices of the immediate past. If they lacked this knowledge, they 
would not be in a position to decide what the appropriate height 
of their cash holdings should be and how much they should spend for 
the acquisition of various goods. A medium of exchange without a 
past is unthinkable. Nothing can enter into the function of a medium 
of exchange which was not already previously an economic good and 
to which people assigned exchange value already before it was de- 
manded as such a medium. 

But the purchasing power handed down from the immediate past 
is modified by today's demand for and supply of money. Human 
action is always pr&iding for the future, be it sometimes only the 
future of the impending hour. He who buys, buys for future con- 
sumption and production. As far as he believes that the future will 
differ from the present and the past, he modifies his vahation and 
appraisement. This is no less true with regard to money than it is 
with regard to all vendible goods. In this sense we may say that 
today's exchange value of money is an anticipation of tomorrow's 
exchange vaIue. The basis of all judgments concerning money is its 
purchasing power as it was in the immediate past. But as far as cash- 
induced changes in purchasing power are expected, a second factor 
enters the scene, the anticipation of these changes. 

He who believes that the prices of the goods in whkh he takes an 
interest will rise, buys more of them than he would have bought in 
the absence of this Lelief; accordingly he restricts his cash holding. 
He who believes that prices will drop, restricts his purchases and thus 
enlarges his cash holding. As long as such speculative anticipations 
are limited to some commodities, they do not bring about a general 
tende~lcy toward changes in cash holding. But it is different if people 
believe that they are on the eve of big cash-induced changes in pur- 
chasing power. When they expect that the money prices of all goods 
will rise or fall, they expand or restrict their purchases. These atti- 
tudes strengthen and accelerate the expected tendencies considerably. 
This goes on until the point is reached beyond which no further 
changes in the purchasing power of money are expected. Only then 
does the inclination to buy or to sell stop and do people begin again 
to increase or to decrease their cash holdings. 

But if once public opinion is convinced that the increase in the 


Human Action 

quantity of money will continue and never come to an end, and that 
consequently the prices of all commodities and services will not 
cease to rise, everybody becomes eager to buy as much as possible 
and to restrict his cash holding to a minimum size. For under these 
circumstances the regular costs incurred by holding cash are in- 
creased by the losses caused by the progrcssivc fall in purchasing 
power. The advantages of holding cash must be paid for by sacrifices 
which are deemed unreasonably burdensome. 'JXs phenomenon was, 
in the great European inflations of the 'twenties, called flight into real 
goods (Flucht in die Sachwrte) or crack-up boom (Katastrophen- 
hausse). The mathematical economists are at a loss to comprehend 
the causal relation between the increase in the quantity of money and 
what they call "velocity of circulation." 

The characteristic nark of the phenomenon is that the increase in 
the quantity of money causes a fall in the demand for money. The 
tendency toward a fail in purchasing power as generated by the in-
creased supply of money is intensified by the general propensity to 
restrict cash holdings which it brings about. Eventually a point is 
reached where the prices at which people would be prepared to part 
with "real" goods discount to such an extent the expected progess 
in the fall of purchasing poxvcr that nobody has a sufficient amount of 
cash at hand to pay them. The monetary system breaks down; all 
transactions in the money concerned cease; a panic makes its pur- 
chasing power vanish altogether. People return either to barter or 
to the use of another kind of money. 

The course of a progressing inflation is this: At the beginning the 
inflow of additional money makes the prices of some commodities 
and services rise; other prices rise latcr. The price rise affects the 
various commodities and services, as has been shown, at different 
dates and to a different extent. 

This first stage of the inflationary process may last for many years. 
'LVhiIe it lasts, the prices of many goods and services are not yet ad- 
justed to the altered money relation. There are still people in the 
country who have not yet become aw-are of the fact that they are 
confronted with a price revohtion which will finaILy result in a 
considerable rise of all prices, although the extent of this rise will not 
be the same in the various commodities and services. These people 
still belicve that prices one day will drop. Waiting for this day, they 
restrict their purchases and concomitantly increase their cash hold- 
ings. As long as such ideas are still held by pubIic opinion, it is not 
yet too late for the government to abandon its inflationary policy. 

But then finally the masses wake up. They become suddenly aware 


Indirect Exchange 

425 

of the fact that inflation is a deliberate policy and will go on end- 
lessly. A breakdown occurs. Thc crack-up boom appears. Every- 
body is anxious to swap his money against "real" goods, no matter 
whether he needs them or not, no matter how much money he has to 
pay for them. Within a very short time, within a few weeks or even 
days, the things which were used as money are no longer used as ~nedia 
of exchange. They become scrap paper. Sobody wants to give away 
anything against them. 

It was this that happened with the Continental currency in America 
in 1781, with the French mandats teuitoriaux in I 796, and with the 
German Mark in I 92 3. It will happen again whenever the same condi- 
tions appear. If a thing has to be used as a medium of exchange, public 
opinion must not believe that thc quantity of this thing will increase 
beyond all bounds. Inflation is a policy that cannot last forever. 

9. The Specific Value of Money 
As far as a good used as money is valued and appraised on account 
of the services it renders for nonmonetary purposes, no problems are 
raised which would require special treatment. The task of the theory 
of money consists merely in dealing with that component in the 
valuation of money which is conditioned by its function as a medium 
of exchange. 

In the course of history various commodities have been employed 
as media of exchange. A long evolution eliminated the greater part 
of these commodities from the monetary function. Only two, the 
precious metals gold and silver, remained. In the second part of the 
nineteenth century more and more governments deliberately turned 
toward the demonetization of silver. 

In a11 these cases what is employed as money is a commodity which 
is used also for nonmonetary purposes. Cnder the gold standard gold 
is money and money is gold. It is immaterial whether or not the laws 
assign legal tender jualjty only to gold coins minted by the govern- 
ment. What counts is tht these coins really contain a fixed weight 
of gold and every quantit). of bullion can freely be transformed into 
coins. Under the gold sta~hard the dollar and the pound sterling were 
merely names for a definite weight of gold, within very narrow mar- 
gins precisely determined by the laws. We may call such a sort of 
money commodity money. 

A second sort of money is credit money. Credit money evolved 
out of the use of money-substitutes. It was cuscomary to use claims, 
payable on demand and absolutely secure, as substitutes for the sum 


Hurnan Action 

of money to which they gave a claim. (We shall deal with the features 
and problems of money-substitutes in the next section.) The market 
did not stop using such claims when one day their prompt redemp- 
tion was suspendcd and thereby doubts about their safety and the 
solvency of the obligee were raised. As long as these claims had been 
daily maturing claims against a debtor of undisputed solvency and 
could be collected without notice and free of expense, their exihange 
value was equal to their face value; it was this perfect equivalcnce 
which assigned to them the character of moncy-substitutes. Now, 
as redemption was suspended, the maturity date postponed to an 
undetermined day, and consequently doubts about the solvency of 
the debtor or at least about his willingness to pay cmerged, they lost 
a part of the value previously ascribed to them. They were now 
merely claims, which did not bear interest, against a questionable 
debtor and falling due on an undefined day. But as they were used as 
media of exchange, their exchange value did not drop to the level 
to which it would have dropped if they were merely claims. 

One can fairly assume that such credit money could remain in use 
as a medium of exchange even if it were to lose its character as a 
claim against a bank or a treasury, and thus would become fiat money. 
Fiat money is a moncy consisting of mere tokens which can neither 
be employed for any industrial purposes nor convey a claim against 
anybody. 

It is not a task of catallactics but of economic history to investigate 
whether there appeared in the past specimens of fiat money or whether 
all the sorts of money which were not commodity money were credit 
money. The only thing that catallactics has to establish is that the 
possibility of the existence of fiat money must be admitted. 

The important thing to be remembered is that with every sort 
of money, demonetization-i.e., the abandonment of its use as a 
medium of exchange-must result in a serious fall of its exchange 
value. What this practically means has become manifest when in the 
last eighty years the use of silver as commodity money has been pro- 
gressively restricted. 

There are specimens of credit money and fiat money which are 
embodied in metallic coins. Such money is printed, as it were, on 
silver, nickel, or copper. If such a piece of fiat moncy is demonetized, 
it still retains exchange value as a piece of metal. But this is only a 
very small indemnification of the owner. It has no practical im- 
portance. 

The keeping of cash hoIding requires sacrifices. To the extent that 
a man keeps money in his pockets or in his balance with a bank, he 


Indirect Exchange 427 

forsakes the instantaneous acquisition of goods he could consume or 
employ for production. In the market economy these sacrifices can 
be precisely determined by calculation. They are equal to the amount 
of originary interest he would have earned by investing the sum. The 
fact that a man takes this falling off into account is proof that he 
prefers the advantages of cash holding to the loss in interest yield. 

It is possible to specify the advantages which people expect-from 
keeping a definite amount of cash. But it is a delusion to assume that 
an analysis of these motives could provide us with a theory of the 
determination of purchasing power which could do without the 
notions of cash holding and demand for and supply of money.12 The 
advantages and disadvantages derived from cash holding are not 
objective factors which could directly influence the size of cash 
holdings. They are put on the scales by each individual and weighed 
against one another. The result is a subjective judgment of value, 
colored by the individual's personality. Different people and the 
same people at different times value the same objective facts in a dif- 
ferent way. Just as knowledge of a man's wealth and his physical con- 
dition does not tell us how much he would be prepared to spend for 
food of a certain nutritive power, so knowledge about data concern- 
ing a man's material situation does not enable us to make definite 
assertions with regard to the size of his cash holding. 

10. The Import of the Money Relation 
The money relation, i.e., the relation between demand for and 
supply of money, uniquely determines the price structure as far 
as the reciprocal exchange ratio between money and the vendible 
commodities and services is involved. 

If the money relation remains unchanged, neither an inflationary 
(expansionist) nor a deflationary (contractionist) pressure on trade, 
business, production, consumption, and employment can emerge. The 
assertions to the contrary reflect the grievances of people reluctant to 
adjust their activities to the demands of their fellow men as mani- 
fested on the market. However, it is not an account of an alleged 
scarcity of money that prices of agricultural products are too low to 
secure to the submarginal farmers proceeds of the amount they would 
like to earn. The cause of these farmers' distress is that other'farmers 
are producing at lower costs. What is wrong with British manufac- 
turing is not that the "level" of prices is too low, but the fact that 

12. Such an attempt was made by Greidanus, The Value of Money (London, 
'932), pp. '97 ff. 

Human Action 

they did not succeed in raising the productivity of the capital in- 
vested and the men employed to a height that would provide all the 
goods the British want to consume. 

An increase in the quantity of goods produced, other things being 
unchanged, must bring about an improvement in people's condi-
tions. Its consequence is a fall in the money prices of the goods the 
production of which has been increased. But such a fall in money 
prices does not in the lcast impair the benefits derived from the addi- 
tional wealth produced. One may consider as unfair the increase in 
the share of the additional wealth which goes to the creditors, al- 
though such criticisms are questionable as far as the rise in purchasing 
power has been correctly anticipated and adequately taken into 
account by a negative price premium.':' But one must not say that a 
fall in prices caused by an increase in the production of the goods 
concerned is the proof of some disequilibrium which cannot be 
eliminated otherwise than by increasing the quantity of money. Of 
course, as a rule every increase in production of some or of all com- 
modities requires a new allocation of factors of production to the 
various branches of business. If the quantity of money remains un- 
changed, the necessity of such a reallocation becomes visible in the 
price structure. Some lines of production become more profitable, 
while in others profits drop or losscs appear. Thus the operation of 
the market tends to eliminate these much discussed disequilibria. It 
is possible by means of an increase in the quantity of money to delay 
or to interrupt this process of adjustment. It is impossible either to 
make it superfluous or less painful for those concerned. 

If the government-made cash-induced changes in the purchasing 
power of money resulted only in shifts of wealth from some people 
to other people. it would riot be permissible to condemn them from 
the point of view of catallactics' scientific neutrality. It is obviously 
fraudulent to justify them under the pretext of the commonweal or 
public welfare. But one could still consider them as political measures 
suitable to promote the interests of some groups of people at the ex- 
pense of others without further detriment. However, there are still 
other things involved. 

It is not necessary to point out the consequences to which a con- 
tinued deflationary policy must lead. Nobody advocates such a 
policy. The favor of the masses and of the wkters and politicians 
eager for applause goes to infiation. With regard to these endeavors 
we must emphasize three points. First: Inflationary or expansionist 

13-About the relations of the market rate of interest and changes in purchas-
ing power, cf. below, Chapter XX. 


Indirect Exchange 429 

policy must result in overconsumption on the one hand and in mal- 
investment on the other. It thus squanders capital and impairs the 
future state of want-satisfaction.14 Second: The inflationary process 
does not remove the necessity of adjusting production and real- 
locating resources. It merely-postpones it and thereby makes it 
more troublesome. Third: Inflation cannot be employed as a per- 
manent policy because it must, when continued, finally result in a 
breakdown of the monetary system. 

A retailer or innkeeper can easily fall prey to the illusion that a11 
that is needed to make him and his colleagues more prosperous is more 
spending on the part of the public. In his eyes the main thing is to 
impel people to spend more. But it is amazing that this belief could be 
presented to the world as a new social philosophy. Lord Keynes and 
his disciples make the lack of the propensity to consume responsible 
for what: they deem unsatisfactory in economic conditions. What is 
needed, in their eyes, to make men more prosperous is not an increase 
in production, but an increase in spending. In order to make it possible 
for people to spend more, an "expansionist" policy is recommended. 

This doctrine is as old as it is bad. Its analysis and refutation will be 
undertaken in the chapter dealing with the trade cycle.15 

I I. The Money-Substitutes 
Claims to a definite amount of money, payable and redeemable on 
demand, against a debtor about whose solvency and willingness to 
pay there does not prevail the slightest doubt, render to the individuaI 
all the services money can render, provided that all parties with whom 
he could possibly transact business are perfectly familiar with these 
essential qualities of the claims concerned: daily maturity and un- 
doubted solvency and willingness to pay on the part of the debtor. 
We may call such cIaims money-substitutes, as they can fully re- 
place money in an individual's or a firm's cash holding. The technical 
and legal features of the money-substitutes do not concern catallactics. 
A money-substitute can be embodied eirher in a banknote or in a de- 
mand deposit with a bank subject to check ("checkbook money" or 
deposit currency), provided the bank is prepared to exchange the 
note or the deposit daily free of charge against money proper. Token 
coins are also money-substitutes, provided the owner is in a position 
to exchange them at need against money free of expense and without 
delay. To achieve this it is not required that the government be 

14. Cf. below, pp. 561-562. 
15. Cf. below, pp. 545-562. 

Human Action 

bound by law to redeem them. What counts is the fact that these 
tokens can be really convcrted free of expense and without delay. 
If the total amount of token coins issued is kept within reasonable 
limits, no special provisions on the part of the government are neces- 
sary to keep their exchange value at par with their facc value. The 
demand of the public for small change gives everybody the opportu- 
nity to exchange them easily against pieces of money. The main thing 
is that every owner of a moncy-substitute is perfectly certain that it 
can, at every instant and free of expense, be exchanged against money. 

If the debtor-the government or a bank-keeps against the whole 
amount of money-substitutes a reserve of money proper, we call the 
moncy-substitute a money-certificate. The individual money-certif- 
icate is-not necessarily in a lcgal sense, but always in the catallactic 
sense-a representative of a corresponding amount of money kept 
in the reserve. The issuing of money-certificates does not increase the 
quantity of things suitable to satisfy the demand for money for cash 
holding. Changes in the quantity of money-certificates therefore do 
not alter the supply of money and the money relation. Thcy do not 
play any role in the determination of the purchasing power of money. 

If the money reserve kcpt by the debtor against the money-sub- 
stitutes issued is less than the total amount of such substitutes, we call 
that amount of substitutes which exceeds the rescrve fiduciary media. 
As a rule it is not possible to ascertain whether a concrete specimen 
of money-substitutes is a money-certificate or a fiduciary medium. A 
part of the total amount of money-substitutes issued is usually covcred 
by a money reserve held. Thus a part of the total amount of money- 
substimtcs issued is money-certificates, the rest fiduciary media. But 
this fact can only be recognized by those familiar with the bank's 
balance sheets. The individual banknote, deposit, or token coin does 
not indicate its catallactic character. 

The issue of money-certificates does not increase the funds which 
the bank can crnploi in the conduct of its lending business. A bank 
which does not issue fiduciary media can only grant commodity 
credit, ie., it can only lend its own funds and the amount of money 
which its customers have entrustcd to it. The issue of fiduciary media 
enlarges the bank's funds available for lending beyond these limits. 
It can now not only grant commodity credit, but also circulation 
credit, i.e., credit granted out of the issue of fiduciary media. 

While the quantity of money-certificates is indifferent, the quantity 

of fiduciary media is not. The fiduciary media affect the market 

phenomena in the same way as money does. Changes in their quantity 


Indirect Exchange 43 1 

influence the determination of money's purchasing power and of 
prices and-temporarily--also of the rate of interest. 

Earlier economists applied a different terminology. Many were pre- 
pared to call the money-substitutes simply money, as they are fit 
to render the services money renders. However, this terminology 
is not expedient. The first purpose of a scientific terminoIogy is to 
facilitate the analysis of the problerns involved. The task of the catal- 
lactic theory of money-as differentiated from the legal theory and 
from the technical disciplines of bank management and accountancy 
-is the study of the problems of the determination of prices and in- 
terest rates. This task requires a sharp distinction between money- 
certificates and fiduciary media. 

The term credit expansion has often been ~nisinterpreted. It is 
important to realize that con~modity credit cannot be expanded. The 
only vehicle of credit expansion is circulation credit. But the grant- 
ing of circulation credit does not always mean credit expansion. If 
the amount of fiduciary media previously issued has consummated 
all its effects upon the market, if prices, wage rates, and interest rates 
have been adjusted to the total supply of money proper plus fiduciary 
media (supply of money in the broader sense), granting of circulation 
credit without a further increase in the quantity of fiduciary media 
is no longer credit expansion. Credit expansion is present only if credit 
is granted by the issue of an additional amount of fiduciary media, 
not if banks lend anew fiduciary media paid back to them by the 
old debtors. 

12. The Limitation on the Issuance of Fiduciary Media 
People deal with money-substitutes as if they were money because 
they are fully confident hat it will bc pssibie to exchange them at 
any time without delay and without cost against money. We may 
call those who share in this confidence and are therefore ready to 
deal with money-substitutes as if they were money, the clients of the 
iss~~ing

banker, bank, or authority. It does not matter whether or not 
this issuing establishment is operated according to the patterns of 
conduct customary in the banking business. Token coins issued by 
a country's treasury are money-substitutes too, although the treasury 
as a rule does not enter the amount issued into its accounts as a 
liability and does not consider this amount a part of the national 
debt. It is no Iess immaterial whether or not the owner of a money- 
substitute has an actionable claim to redemption. What counts is 


Human Action 

whether the money-substitute can reaIly be exchanged against money 
without delay and cost.16 

Issuing money-certificates is an expensive venture. The banknotes 
must be printed, the token coins minted; a compIicated accounting 
system for the deposits must be organized; the reserves must be kept 
in safety; then there is the risk of being cheated by counterfeit bank- 
notes and checks. Against all these expenses stands only the slight 
chance that some of thc banknotes issued may be destroyed and the 
still slighter chance that some depositors may forget their deposits. 
Issuing money-certificates is a ruinous business if not connected with 
issuing fiduciary media. In the early history of banking there were 
banlis whose only operation consisted in issuing money-certificates. 
But these banlis were indemnified by their clients for the costs in- 
curred. At any rate, catallactics is not iritcrested in the purely 
technical problems of banks not issuing 5ducjary mcdia. The only 
interest that catallactics takes in money-certificates is the connection 
between issuing them and the issuing if fiduciary media. 

W7hile the quantity of nloncy-certificates is catallactically unim- 
portant, an increase or decrease in the quantity of fiduciary media 
affects the determination of money's purchasing power in the same 
way as do changes in the quantity of money. Nence the question of 
whether there are or are not limits to the increase in the quantity of 
fiduciary media has fundamental importance. 

If the clientele of the bank includes all rnembers of the market 
economy, the limit to the issue of fiduciary media is the same as that 
drawn to the increase in the quantity of money. A bank which is, 
in an isolated country or in the whole world, the only institution 
issuing fiduciary mcdia and the clientele of which comprises all in- 
dividuals and firms, is bound to comply in its conduct of affairs with 
two rules: 

First: It must avoid any action which could tnake the clients-i.e., 
the public-suspicious. As soon as the clients begin to lose confidence, 
:hey will ask for the rcdemption of the banknotes and withdraw their 

16. It is furthermore immaterial whether or not the laws assign to the rnoney- 
substitutes legal tender quality. If these things are really dealt with by people as 
money-substitutes and are therefore money-substitutes and equal in purchasing 
power to the respective amount of money, the only effect of the legal tender 
quality is to prevent malicious people from resorting to chicanery for the mere 
sake of annoying their fellow men. If, however, the things concerned are not 
money-substitutes and are traded at a discount below their face value, the assign- 
ment of legal tender quality is tantamount to an authoritarian price ceiling, the 
fixing of a maximum price for gold and foreign exchange and of a minimum 
price for the things which are no longer money-substitutes but either credit 
money or fiat money. Then the effects appear which Gresham's Law describes. 

Indirect Exchange 433 

deposits. How far the bank can go on increasing its issues of fiduciary 
media without arousing distrust, depends on psychological conditions. 

Second: It must not increase the amount of fiduciary ~nedia at 
such a rate and with such speed that the clients get the conviction 
that the rise in prices will continue endlessly at an accelerated pace. 
For if the public believes that this is the case, they will reduce their 
cash holdings, flee into "real" values, and bring about the crack-up 
boom. It is impossible to imagine the approach of this catastrophe 
without assuming that its fifst manifestation consists in the evanescence 
of confidence. The public will certainly prefer exchanging the 
fiduciary media against money to fleeing into real values, i.e., to the 
indiscriminate buying of various commodities. Then the bank must 
go bankrupt. If the government interferes by freeing the bank from 
the obligation of redeeming its banknotes and of paying back the 
deposits in compliance with the terms of the contract, the fiduciary 
~ncdia become either credit money or fiat money. The suspension of 
specie paymenrs entirely changes the state of affairs. There is no longer 
any q~~estion 

of fiduciary media, of money-certificates, and of money- 
substitutes. The government enters the scene with its government- 
made legal tender laws. The bank loses its independent existence; it 
t~ccornesa tool of government policies, a subordinate office of the 
treasury. 

The catallactically most important problems of the issuance of 
fiduciary media on the part of a singlc bank, or of banks acting in 
concert, the clientele of which comprehends all individuals, are not 
those of the limitations drawn to the amount of their issuance. We will 
deal with them in Chapter XX, devoted to the relations between the 
quantity of money and the rate of interest. 

At this point of our investigations we have to scrutinize the prob- 
lem of the coexistence of a multiplicity of independent banks. In-
dependence means that every bank in issuing fiduciary media follows 
its own coursc and does I& act in concert with oiher banks. Co- 
existence means that every bank has a clientele which does not in- 
clude all members of the market system. For the sake of simplicity 
we will assume that no individual or firm is a client of more than one 
bank. It would not affect the result of our demonstration if we were 
to assume that there are also people who are clients of more than one 
bank and people who are not clients of any bank. 

7-he question to be raised is not whether or not there are limits 
to the issuance of fiduciary media on the part of such independently 
coexisting banks. As there are even limits to the issuance of fiduciary 
media on the part of a unique bank the clientele of which comprises 


Human Action 

all people, it is obvious that there arc such limits for a multiplicity 
of indcpendently coexisting banks too. What we want to show is that 
for such a multiplicity of independently coexisting banks the limits 
are narrower than those drawn for a single bank with an unlimited 
clientele. 

We assume that within a market system several independent banks 
have been established in the past. While previously only money was 
in use, these banks have introduced the use of money-substitutes a 
part of which are fiduciary media. Each bank has a clientele and has 
issucd a certain quantity of fiduciary media which arc kept as moncy- 
substitutes in the cash holdings of various clients. The total quantity of 
the fiduciary media as issued by the banks and absorbed by the cash 
holdings of their clients has altercd the structure of prices and the 
monetary unit's purchasing power. But these effects have already been 
consumn~ated and at present thc ~narltet is no longer stirred bv any 
movements gcncrated from this past credit expansion. 

But now, we assume further, one bank alone cmbarlis upon an addi- 
tional issue of fiduciary media whiIc the other banks do not follow 
suit. The clients of the cxpanding bank-whether its old clients 
or new ones acquired on account of the expansion-receive additional 
credits, they expand their business activities, they appear on the 
market with an additional demand for goods and services, they bid 
up priccs. Those people who are not clients of the expandingvbank 
are not in a position to afford thcse higher priccs; they arc forced to 
rcstrict their purchases. Thus there prevails on the market a shifting 
of goods from the nonclients to the clients of the expanding bank. The 
clients buy more from the nonclients than they sell to thcm; they havc 
more to pay to the nonclients than th& receive from them. But 
money-substitutes issued by the expand& bank arc not suitablc for 
paymcnts to nonclients, as these people do not assign to them the 
ch'aracter of moncy-substitutes. In order to settle the payments due 
to nonclients, the clients must first exchange the money-substitutes 
issued by their own-viz., the expanding bank-against moncy. Thc 
cxpanding bank must redeem its banknotes and pay out its deposits. 
Its reserve-we suppose that only a part of the money-substitutcs it 
had issued had the character of fiduciary media-dwindles. The in- 
stant approaches in which the bank will-after the exhaustion of its 
tnoncy reservc-no longer be in a position to redecm the money- 
substitutes stilI current. In ordcr to avoid insolvency it must as soon 
as possible return to a policy of strengthening its moncy rescrve. It 
must abandon its expansionist methods. 

This reaction of the market to a credit expansion on the part of a 


Indirect Exchange 435 

bank with a limited clientele has been brilliantly described by the 
Currency School. The special case dealt with by the Currency School 
referred to the coincidence of credit expansion on the part of one 
country's privileged central bank or of all banks of one country and 
of a nonexpansionist policy on the part of the banks of other countries. 
Our demonstration covers the more general case of the coexistence of 
a multiplicity of banks with different clientele as well as the most 
general case of the existence of one bank with a limited clientele in a 
system in which the rest of the people do not patronize any bank 
and do not consider any claims as money-substitutes. It does not 
matter, of course, whether one assumes that the clients of a bank live 
neatly separated from those of the other banks in a definite district 
or country or whether they live together with those of the other 
banks. These are merely differences in the data not affecting the 
catallactic problems involved. 

A bank can never issue more money-substitutes than its clients 
can keep in their cash holdings, The individual client can never keep 
a larger portion of his total cash holding in money-substitutes than 
that corresponding to the proportion of his turnover with other 
clients of his bank to his total turnover. For considerations of con- 
venience he will, as a rule, remain far below this maximum propor- 
tion. Thus a limit is drawn to the issue of fiduciary media. We may 
admit that everybody is ready to accept in his current transactions 
indiscriminately banknotes issued by any bank and checks drawn 
upon any bank. But he deposits without delay with his own bank not 
only the checks but also the banknotes of banks of which he is not 
himself a client. In the further course his bank settles its accounts with 
the bank engaged. Thus the process described above comes into 
motion. 

A lot of nonsense has been written about a perverse predilection 
of the public for banknotes issued by dubious banks. The truth is that, 
cxcept for small groups of businessmen who were able to distinguish 
bemeen good and bad banks, banknotes were always looked upon 
with distrust. It was the special charters which the governments 
granted to privileged banks that slowly made these suspicions dis- 
appear. The often advanced argument that small banknotes come into 
the hands of poor and ignorant people who cannot distinguish be- 
tween good and bad notes cannot be taken seriously. The poorer 
the recipient of a banknote is and the less familiar he is with bank 
affairs, the more quickly will he spend the note and the more quickly 
will it return, by wai of retail and wholesale trade, to the issuing 
bank or to people conversant with banking conditions. 


Huma~Action 

It is very easy for a bank to increase the number of people who are 
ready to accept loans granted by credit expansion and paid out in 
an amount of money-substitutes. But it is very difficult for any bank 
to enlarge its clientele, that is, the number of people who are ready to 
consider these claims as money-substitutes and to keep them as such 
in their cash-holdings. To enlarge this clientele is a troublesome and 
slow process, as is the acquisition of any kind of good will. On the 
other hand, a bank can lose its clientele very quickly. If it wants to 
preserve it, it must never permit any doubt about its ability and 
readiness to discharge all its liabilities in due compliance with the 
terms of the contract. A reserve must be licpt large enough to redeem 
all banknotes which a holder may submit for redemption. There- 
fore no bank can content itself with issuing fiduciary media only; it 
must keep a reserve against the total amount of money-substi&es 
issued and thus combine issuing fiduciary media and rnoney-certif- 
icates. 

It was a serious blunder to believe that the reserve's task is to pro- 
vide the means for the redemption of those banknotes the holders of 
which have lost confidence in the bank. The confidence which a bank 
and the money-substitutes it has issued enjoy is indivisible. It is either 
present with all its clients or it vanishes entirely. If some of the clients 
lose confidence, the rest of them lose it too. No bank issuing fiduciary 
media and granting circulation credit can fulfill the oblig-ations which 
it has taken over in issuing money-substitutes if all clients are losing 
confidence and want to have their banknotes redeemed and their 
deposits paid back. This is an essential feature or weakness of the 
business of issuing fiduciary media and granting circulation credit. 
KO system of reserve policy and no reserve requirements as enforced 
by the laws can remedy it. All that a reserve can do is to make it pos- 
sible for the bank to withdraw from the market an excessive amount 
of fiduciary media issued. If the bank has issued more banknotes than 
its clients can use in doing business with other clients, it must redeem 
such an excess. 

The laws which compelled the banks to keep a reserve in a definite 
ratio of the total amount of deposits and of banknotes issued were 
effective in so far as they restricted the increase in the amount of 
fiduciary media and of circulation credit. They were futile as far as 
they aimed at safeguarding, in the event of a loss of confidence, the 
prompt redemption of the banlmotes and the prompt payment of 
deposits. 

The Banking School failed entirely in dealing with these problems. 

It was confused by a spurious idea according to which the require- 


Indirect Exchange 43 7 

ments of business rigidly limit the maximum amount of convertible 
banknotes that a bank can issue. They did not see that the demand 
of the public for credit is a magnitude dependent on the banks' 
readiness to lend, and that banks which do not bother about their own 
solvency are in a position to expand circulation credit by lowering 
the rate of interest below the market rate. It is not true that the maxi- 
mum amount which a bank can lend if it limits its lending to discount- 
ing short-term bills of exchange resulting from the sale and purchase 
of raw materials and half-manufactured goods, is a quantity uniquely 
determined by the state of business and independent of the bank's 
policies. This quantity expands or shrinks with the lowering or rais- 
ing of the rate of discount. Lowering the rate of interest is tantamount 
to increasing the quantity of what is mistakenly considered as the 
fair and normal requirements of business. 

The Currency School gave a quite correct explanation of the re- 
curring crises as they upset English business conditions in the 'thirties 
and 'forties of the nineteenth century. There was credit expansion on 
the part of the Bank of England and the other British banks and 
bankers, while there was no credit expansion, or at least not to the 
same degree, in the countries with which Great Britain traded. The 
external drain occurred as the necessary consequence of this state 
of affairs. Everything that the IZanking School advanced in order to 
refute this theory was vain. Unfortunately, the Currency School 
erred in two respects. It never realized that the remedy it suggested, 
namely strict legal limitation of the amount of banknotes issued be- 
yond the specie reserve, was not the only one. It never gave a thought 
to the idea of free banking. The second fault of the Currency School 
was that it failed to recognize that deposits subject to check are 
money-substitutes and, as far as their amount exceeds the reserve kept, 
fiduciary media, and consequentl\; no less a vehicle of credit expan- 
sion than are banknotes. It was thk only merit of the Banking School 
that it recognized that what is called deposit currency is a money- 
substitute no less than banknotes. But except for this point, all the 
doctrines of the Banking School were spurious. It was guided by 
contradictory ideas concerning money's neutrality; it tried to refute 
the quantity theory of money by referring to a deus ex macbinn, the 
much talked about hoards, and it misconstrued entirely the problems 
of the rate of interest. 

It must be emphasized that the problem of legal restrictions upon 
the issue of fiduciary media could emerge only because governments 
had granted special privileges to one or seveial banks and had thus 
prevented the free evolution of banking. If the governments had 


Human Action 

never interfered for the benefit of speciaI banks, if they had never 
released some banks from the obligation, incumbent upon all indi- 
viduals and firms in the market economy, to settle their liabilities in 
full compliance with the terms of the contract, no bank problem 
would have come into being. The limits which are drawn to credit 
expansion would have worked effectively. Considerations of its own 
solvency would have forced every bank to cautious restraint in issuing 
fiduciary media. Those banks which would not have observed 
these indispensable rules would have gone bankrupt, and the public, 
warned through damage, would have become doubly suspicious and 
reserved. 

The attitudes of the European governments and their satellites with 
regard to banking were from thc beginning insincere and mendacious. 
The pretended solicitude for the nation's welfare, for the public in 
general, and for the poor ignorant masses in particular was a mere 
blind. The governments wanted inflation and credit expansion, they 
wanted booms and easy money. Those Americans who twice suc- 
ceeded in doing away with a central bank were aware of the dangers 
of such institutions; it was only too bad that they failed to see that 
the evils they fought \\.ere present in every kind of government in- 
tcrferencc with banking. Today even the most bigoted Ctatists cannot 
deny that a11 the alleged evils of free banking count little when 
compared with the disastrous effects of the tremendous inflations 
which the privileged and government-controlled banks have brought 
about. 

It is a fable that governments interfered with banking in order to 
restrict the issue of fiduciary media and to prevent credit expansion. 
The idea that guided governments was, on the contrary, the lust for 
inflation and credit expansion. They privileged banks because they 
wanted to widen the limits drawn to credit expansion by conditions 
prevailing on the unhampered market or because they were eager to 
open to the treasury a source of revenue. For the most part both of 
these considerations motivated the authorities. They were convinced 
that the fiduciary media are an efficient means of lowering the rate 
of interest, and asked the banks to expand credit for the bcnefit of 
both business and the treasury. Only when the undesired effects of 
credit expansion became visible, were laws enacted to restrict the 
issue of banknotes-and sometimes also of deposits-not covered by 
specie. The establishment of free banking was never seriously con- 
sidered precisely because it would have been too efficient in restrict- 
ing credit expansion. For rulers, writers, and the public were unani- 
mous in the belief that business has a fair claim to a "normal" and 


Indirect Exchange 

'hecessary" amount of circulation credit and that this amount could 
not be attained under free banking1' 

Many governments never looked upon the issuance of fiduciary 
media from a point of view other than that of fiscal concerns. In 
their eves the foremost task of the banks was to lend money to the 
treasury. The money-substitutes were pacemakers for government- 
issued paper money. The convertibIe banknote was merely a first step 
on the way to the nonredeemable banknote. With the progress of 
statolatry and the policy of interventionism these ideas have become 
general and are no longer questioned by anybody. No government 
is willing today to give any thought to the program of free banlting 
lxxause no government wants to renounce what it considers a handy 
scurce of revenue. What is called today financial war preparedness 
is merely the ability to procure by means of privileged and govern- 
ment-controlled banks all the money a warring nation may need. 
Radical inflationism, although not adrnitted explicitly, is an essentia1 
feature of the economic ideology of our age. 

nut even at the time liberalism enjoyed its highest prestige and 
governments were more eager to preserve peace and welI-being than 
to foment mar, death, destruction, and misery, people were biased 
in dealing with the problems of banking. Outside of the Anglo-Saxon 
countries public opinion was convinced that it is one of the main 
tasks of good government to lower the rate of interest and that credit 
expansion is the appropriate means for the attainment of this end. 

Great Britain was free from these errors when in 1844it reformed 
its bank laws. But the two shortcomings of the Currency School 
vitiated this famous act. On one hand, the system of government in- 
terference with banking was preserved. On the other hand, limits 
were placed only on the issuance of banknotes not covered by specie. 
The fiduciary media were suppressed only in the shape of banknotes. 
They could thrive as deposit currency. 

111 carrying the idea implied in the Currency Theory to its full 
logical conclusion, one could suggest that all banks be forced by law 
to keep against the total amount of money-substitutes (banknotes 
plus demand deposits) a ioo per ccnt money reserve. This is the core 
of Professor Irving Fisher's ioo per ccnt plan. But Professor Fisher 
combined his plan with his proposals concerning the adoption of an 
index-number standard. It has been pointed out already why such a 

17. The notion of "normaIn credit expansion is absurd. Issuance of additional 
fiduciary media, no matter what its quantity may be: always sets in motion those 
changes in the price structure the description of which is the task of the theory of 
the trade cycle. Of course, if the additional amount issued is not large, neither are 
the inevitable effects of the expansion. 

Human Action 


scheme is illusory and tantamount to open approval of the govern- 
ment's power to manipulate purchasing power according to the 
appetites of powerful pressure groups. But even if the IOO per cent 
reserve plan were to be adopted on the basis of the unadulterated 
gold standard, it would not entireIy remove the drawbacks inherent 
in every kind of government interference with banking. What is 
needed to prevent any further credit expansion is to place the bank- 
ing business under the general rules of commercia1 and civil laws 
compelling every individual and firm to fulfill all obIigations in full 
compliance with the terms of the contract. If banks are preserved as 
privileged establishments subject to special legislative provisions, the 
tool remains that governments can use for fiscal purposes. Then every 
restriction imposed upon the issuance of fiduciary media depends 
upon the government's and the padiament's good intentions. 'llley 
may limit the issuance for periods which are called normal. The 
restriction will be withdrawn whenever a government deems that 
an emergency justifies resorting to extraordinary measures. If an 
administration and the party backing it want to increase expenditure 
without jeopardizing their popularity through the imposition of 
higher taxes, they will always be ready to call their irnpasse an 
emergency. Recourse to the printing press and to the obsequiousness 
of bank managers, willing to oblige the authorities regulating thcir 
conduct of affairs, is the foremost means of governments eager to 
spend money for purposes for which the taxpayers are not ready to 
pay higher taxes. 

Free banking is the only method available for the prevention of 
the dangers inherent in credit expansion. It would, it is truc, not 
hinder a slow credit expansion, kept within very narrow limits, on 
the part of cautious banks which provide the public with all informa- 
tion required about their financial status. But under free banking it 
would have been impossible for credit expansion with all its inevitable 
consequences to have developed into a regular-one is tempted to say 
normai-feature of rhe economic system. Only free banking wouici 
have rendered the market economy secure against crises and depres- 
sions. 

Looking backward upon the history of the last hundred years, one 
cannot help realizing that the blunders committed by liberalism in 
handling the problems of banking were a deadly blow to the market 
economy. There was no reason whatever to abandon the principle 
of free enterprise in the field of banking. The majority of liberal 
politicians simply surrendered to the popular hostility against money- 
lending and interest taking. They failed to realize'that the rate of 


Indirect Exchange 

interest is a market phenomenon which cannot be manipulated ad 
libitum by the authorities or by any other agency. They adopted the 
superstiti& that lowering the rate of interest is beneficial and that 
credit expansion is the right means of attaining such cheap money. 
Nothing harmed the cause of liberalism more than the almost regular 
rcturn of feverish booms and of the dramatic breakdown of bull mar- 
kets followed by lingering slumps. Public opinion has become con- 
vinced that such happenings are inevitable in the unhampered mar-
ket economy. People did nor conceive that what they lamented was 
the necessary outcome of policies directed toward a lowering of the 
rate of interest by means of credit expansion. They stubbornly kept 
to these policies and tried in vain to fight their undesired consequences 
by more and more government interference. 

Observdons on the Di~cwssions Concerning Free Banking 

The Banking School taught that an overissuance of banknotes is im- 
possible if the bank limits its business to the granting of short-term loans. 
When the loan is paid back at maturity, the banknotes rcturn to the bank 
and thus disappear from the market. However, this happens only if the 
bank restricts the amount of credits granted. (Rut even then it would not 
undo the effects of its previous credit expansion. It would merely add to it 
the effects of a later credit contraction.) The regular course of affairs is 
that the bank rcplaces the bills expired and paid back by discounting new 
bills of exchange. Then to the amount of banknotes withdrawn from the 
market by the repayment of the earlier loan there corresponds an amount 
of newly issued banknotes. 

The concatenation which sets a limit to credit expansion under a system 
of free banking works in a different way. It has no reference whatever to 
the process which this so-called Principle of Fullarton has in mind. It is 
brought about by the fact that credit expansion in itself does not expand a 
bank's clientele, viz., the number of people who assign to the demand- 
claims against this bank the character of money-substitutes. Since the over- 
issuance of fiduciary media on the part of one bank, as has been shown 
above, increases the amounr to be paid by the expanding bank% ciients to 
other people, it increases concomitantly the demand for the redemption 
of its moncy-substitutes. It thus forces the expanding bank back to a re- 
straint.18 

This fact was never questioned with regard to demand deposits subject 
to check. It is obvious that an expanding bank would very soon find itself 
in a difficult position in clearing with the other banks. However, people 
sometimes maintained that things are different as far as banknotes are con- 
cerned. 

18. Vera C. Smith has not paid due attention to this primordial fact in her 
meritorious book The Rationale of Central Banking (Londnn, 1936), pp. 157ff. 

Hu7nan Action 

In deaIing with the problems of money-substitutes, catallactics main- 
tains that the claims in question are dealt with by a number of people like 
money, that they are, like money, given away and received in transactions 
and kept in cash holdings. Everything that catallactics asserts with regard 
to money-substitutes presupposes this state of affairs. But it would be pre- 
posterous to beIieve that every banknote issued by any bank really becomes 
a money-substitute. What makes a banknote a money-substitute is the 
special kind of good will of the issuing bank. The slightest doubt concern- 
ing the bank's ability or willingness to redeem every banknote without any 
delay at any time and with no expense to the bearer impairs this special 
good will and removes the banknotes' character as a money-substitute. We 
may assume that everybody not only is prepared to get such questionable 
banknotes as a loan but also prefers to receive them as payment instead of 
waiting longer. But if any doubts exist concerning their prime character, 
people will hurry to get rid of them as soon as possible. They will keep in 
their cash holdings money and such money-substitutes as they consider 
perfectly safe and will dispose of the suspect banknotes. These banknotes 
will be traded at a discount, and this fact wilI carry thcm back to the issuing 
bank which alone is bound to redeem thcm at their full face value. 

The issue can still better be clarified by reviewing banking conditions in 
continental Europe. Here the commercial banks were free from any limita- 
tion concerning the amount of deposits subject to check. They would have 
been in a position to grant circulation credit and thus expand credit by 
adopting the methods applied by the banks of the Anglo-Saxon countries. 
However, the public was not ready to treat such bank deposits as money- 
substitutes. As a rule a man who received a check cashed it immediately 
and thereby withdrew the amount from the bank. It was impossible for a 
commercial bank to lend, except for negligibIe sums, by crediting the 
debtor's account. As soon as the debtor wrote out a check, a withdrawal of 
the amount concerned from the bank resulted. OnIy a small group of big 
business treated deposits with the country's Central Bank of Issue (not 
those with the commercial banks) as money-substitutes. Although the 
Central Banks in most of these countries were not submitted to any legal 
restrictions with regard to their deposit business, they were prevented from 
using it as a vehicle of large-scale credit expansion because the clientele for 
deposit currency was too small. Banknotes were practicalIy the sole in-
strument of circulation credit and credit expansion. Similar conditions 
prevailed and for the most part still prevail by and large in all countries 
of the world which are outside the pale of Anglo-Saxon banking meth- 
ods. 

In the 'eighties of the nineteenth century the Austrian Government em- 
barked upon a project of popularizing checkbook money by establishing a 
checking account department with the Post Office Savings Service. It suc- 
ceeded to some degree. Balances with this department of the Post Office 
were treated as money-substitutes by a clientele which was broader than 
that of the checking account department of the country's Central Bank of 


Indirect Exchange 

Issue. The system was later preserved by the new states which in 191 8 suc-
ceeded the Habsburg Empire. It has also been adopted by many other 
European nations, for instance Germany. It is important to realize that this 
kind of deposit currency was a purely governmental venture and that the 
circulation credit that the system granted was exclusively lent to the 
governments. It is characteristic that the name of the Austrian Post Office 
Savings Institution, and likewise of most its foreign replicas, was not Sav- 
ings Bank, but Savings Ofice (Amt). Apart from these demand deposits 
with the government post system in most of the non-Anglo-Saxon com- 
tries, banknotes-and, to a small extent, also deposits with the Government- 
controlled Central Bank of Issue-are the only vehicles of circulation 
credit. In speaking of credit expansion with regard to these countries, one 
refers almost entirely to banknotes. 

In the United States many employers pay salaries and even wages by 
writing out checks. As far as the payees immediately cash the checks re- 
ceived and withdraw the whole amount from the bank, the method means 
merely that the onerous burden of manipdating coins and banknotes is 
shifted from the employer's cashier to the bank's cashier. It has no catallac- 
tic implications. If all citizens were to deal in this way with checks receivcd, 
the deposits would not be money-substitutes and could not be used as in- 
struments of circulation credit. It is solely the fact that a considerable part 
of the public looks upon deposits as money-substitutes that makes them 
what is popularly called checkbook money or dcposit currency. 

It is a mistake to associate with the notion of free banking the image of a 
state of affairs under which everybody is free to issue banknotes and to 
cheat the public ad libitum. People often refer to the dictum of an anony- 
mous American quoted by Tooke: "Free trade in banking is free trade in 
swindling." However, freedom in the issuance of banknotes would have 
narrowed down the use of banknotes considerably if it had not entirely 
suppressed it. It was this idea which Cernuschi advanced in thc hearings of 
the French Banking Inquiry on October 24, 1865: "I believe that what is 
called freedom of banking would result in a total suppression of banknotes 
in France. I want to give everybody the right to issue banknotes so that 
nobody should take any banknotes any longer." 

People may uphold the opinion that banknotes are more handy than 

coins and that considerations of convenience recommend their use. As far 

as this is the case, the public would be prepared to pay a premium for the 

avoidance of the inconveniences involved in carrying a heavy weight of 

coins in their pockets. Thus in earlier days banknotes issued by banks of 

unquestionable solvency stood at a slight premium as against rnetallic cur- 

rency. Thus travelers' checks are rather popular although the bank issuing 

them charges a commission for their issuance. But all this has no reference 

whatever to the problem in question. It does not provide a justification 

for the policies urging the public to resort to the use of banknotes. Govern- 

19. Cf. Cernuschi, Contre le billet de banque (Paris, 1866), p. 55. 

Human Action 

ments did not foster the use of banltnotes in order to avoid inconvenience 

to ladies shopping. Their idea was to lower the rate of interest and to open 

a source of cheap credit to their treasuries. In their eyes the increase in the 

quantity of fiduciary media was a means of promoting welfare. 

Banknotes are not indispensable. All the economic achievements of 
capitalism would have been accomplished if they had never existed. Besides, 
deposit currency can do all the things banknotes do. And government in- 
terference with the deposits of commercial banks cannot be justified by the 
hypocritical pretext that poor ignorant wage earners and farmers must be 
protected against wicked bankers. 

But, some people may ask, what about a cartel of the commercial banks? 

Could not the banks collude for the sake of a boundless expansion of their 

issuance of fiduciary media? The objection is preposterous. As long as the 

public is not, by government interference, deprived of the right of with- 

drawing its deposits, no bank can risk its own good will by collusion with 

banks whose good will is not so high as its own. One must not forget that 

every bank issuing fiduciary media is in a rather precarious position. Its 

most valuable asset is its reputation. It must go bankrupt as soon as doubts 

arise concerning its perfect trustworthiness and solvency. It would be 

suicidal for a bank of good standing to link its name with that of other 

banks with a poorer good will. Under free banking a cartel of the banks 

would destroy the country's wholc banking system. It would not servc the 

interests of any bank. 

For the most part the banks of good repute are blamed for their con- 

servatism and their reluctance to expand credit. In the eyes of people not 

deserving of credit such restraint appears as a vice. But it is the first and 

supreme rule for the conduct of banking operations under frce banking. 

It is extremely difficult for our contemporaries to conceive of the con- 

ditions of free banking because they take government interference with 

banking for granted and as necessary. However, one must remember that 

this government interference was based on the erroneous assumption that 

credit expansion is a proper means of lowering the rate of interest per- 

manently and without harm to anybody but the callous capitalists. The 

governments interfered precisely because they knew that frce banking 

keeps credit expansion within narrow limits. 

Economists may be ~ight in asserting that the present state of banking 
makes government interference with banking problems advisable. But this 
present state of banking is not the outcome of the operation of the un- 
hampered market economy. It is a product of the various governments' at- 
tempts to bring about the conditions required for large-scale credit ex- 
pansion. If the governments had nevcr interfered, the use of banknotes and 
of deposit currency would be limited to those strata of the population u110 
know very well how to distinguish between solvent and insolvent banks. 
KO large-scale credit expansion wouId have been possible. The govern- 
ments alone are responsible for the spread of the superstitious awe with 
which the common man looks upon every bit of paper upon which the 


Indirect Exchange 

treasury or agencies which it controls have printed the magical words 
legal tender. 

Government interfercnce with the present state of banking affairs could 
be justified if its aim were to liquidate the unsatisfactory conditions by pre- 
venting or at least seriously restricting any further credit expansion. In 
fact, the chief objective of present-day government interference is to in- 
tensify further credit expansion. This policy is doomed to faiIure. Sooner 
or later it must result in a catastrophe. 

I 3. The Size and Composition of Cash Holdings 

The total amount of money and money-substitutes is kept by in- 
dividuals and firms in their cash holdings. The share of each is de- 
termined by marginal utility. Each is eager to keep a certain portion 
of his total wealth in cash. He gets rid of an excess of cash by in- 
creased purchases and remedies a deficiency of cash by increased 
sales. The popular terminology confusing the demand for money for 
cash holding and the demand for wealth and vendible goods must not 
delude an economist. 

What is valid with regard to individuals and firms is no less true 
with regard to cvery sum of the cash holdings of a number of in- 
dividuals and firms. he point of view from which we treat a num-
ber of such individuals and firms as a totality and sum up their cash 
holdings is immaterial. The cash holdings oi a city, a province, or a 
country is the sum of the cash holdings of all its residents. 

Let us assume that the market economy uses only one kind of money 
and that money-substitutes are either unknown or used in the whole 
arca by everybody without any difference. Thcre are, for example, 
gold money and redeemable banknotes, issued by a world bank and 
treated by everybody as money-substitutes. On these assumptions 
measures hindering the exchange of commodities and services do not 
affect the state of monetary affairs and the size of cash holdings. 
Tarifis, embargoes, and migration barriers affect the tendencies to- 
ward an equalization of prices, wages, and interest rates. They do not 
react directly upon cash holdings. 

If a government aims at increasing the amount of cash kept by its 
subjects, it must order them to deposit a certain amount with an office 
and to leave it there untouched. The necessity of procuring this 
amount would force everybody to sell more and ;o buy less; domestic 
prices would drop; cxports would be increased and imports reduced; 
a quantity of cash would be imported. But if the government were 
simply to obstruct the importation of goods and the exportation of 


Human Action 

money, it would fail to attain its goal. If imports drop, other things 
being equal, exports drop concomitantly. 

The role money plays in international trade is not diffcrcnt from 
that which it plays in domestic trade. Money is no less a medium of 
exchange in foreign trade than it is in domestic trade. Both in domcstic 
trade and in international trade purchases and sales result in a more 
than passing change in the cash holdings of individuals and firms only 
if people are purposely intent upon increasing or restricting the size 
of their cash holdings. A surplus of moncy flows into a country only 
when its rcsidents are more eager to increase their cash holdings than 
are the foreigners. An outflow of money occurs only if the residents 
arc more eager to reduce their cash holdings than are the foreigners. 
A transfer of money from one country into another country which 
is not compensated by a transfcr in the opposite direction is never the 
unintended result of international trade transactions. It is always the 
outcome of intended changes in the cash holdings of the residents. 
Just as wheat is cxported only if a country's residents want to export 
a surplus of wheat, so money is exportcd only if the rcsidcnts want to 
export a sum of money which they consider as a surplus. 

If a country turns to the employment of money-substitutes which 

are not employed abroad, such a surpIus emerges. The appearance of 

these money-substitutes is tantamount to an increase in the country's 

supply of money in the broader sense, i.c., supply of money plus 

fiduciary media; it brings about a surplus in the supply of moncy in 

the broadcr sense. The residents are eager to get rid of their share 

in the surplus by increasing their purchases either of domestic or of 

foreign goods. In the first case cxports drop and in the second case 

imports increase. In both cases the surplus of money goes abroad. As, 

according to our assumption, money-substitutes cannot be exportcd, 

only money proper flows out. The result is that within the domestic 

supply of money in the broader sense (money +fiduciary media) 

the portion of money drops and the portion of fiduciary media in- 

creases. The domestic stock of money in the narrower sense is now 

smaller than it was previously. 

Now, we assume further, the domestic money-substitutes cease 

to be money-substitutes. The bank which issued them no longer 

redeems them in money. These former ~noney-substitutes are now 

claims against a bank which does not fulfill its obligations, a bank 

whose ability and wilIingncss to pay its debts is questionable. No- 

body knows whcther and when they will ever be redeemed. But it 

may be that these claims are used by the public as credit money. As 

money-substitutes they had been considered as equivalents of the 


lndirect Exchange 

sum of money to which they gave a claim payable at any moment. 
As credit money they are now traded at a discount. 

At this point the government may interfere. It decrees that these 
pieces of credit money are legal tender at their face value.'O Every 
creditor is bound to accept them in payment at their face value. No 
trader is free to discriminate acrainst them. The decree tries to force 

P

the public to treat things of different exchange value as if they had 
the same exchange value. It interferes with the structure of prices 
as determined by the market. It fixes ~ninimum prices for the credit 
money and maximum prices for the commodity money (gold) and 
fore& exchange. The result is not what the government aimed at. 
The difference in exchange value between credit money and gold 
does not disappear. As it is forbidden to employ the coins according 
to their market price, people no longer employ them in buying and 
selling and in paying debts. They keep them or they export them. 
The conmodity money disappears from the domestic market. Bad 
money, says res sham's Law, drives good money out of the coun- 
try. It would be more correct to say that the money which the 
government's decree has undervalued disappears from the market 
and the money which the decree has overvalued remains. 

The outflow of commodity money is thus not the effect of an un- 
favorable balance of payments, but the effect of a government inter- 
ference with the price structure. 

14. Balances of Payments 
The confrontation of the money equivalent of all incomings and 
outgoings of an individual or a group of individuals during any par- 
ticular period of time is called the balance of payments. The credit 
side and the debit side art always equal. The balance is always in 
balance. 

If we want to know an ,ndividual's position in the frame of the 
tnarltet economy, we must look at his balance of payments. It tells us 
everything about the role he plays in the system of the social division 
of labor. It shows what he gives to his fellow men and what he receives 
or takes from them. It shows whether he is a self-supporting decent 
citizen or a thief or an almsman. It shows whether he consumes a11 his 
proceeds or whether he saves a part of them. There are many human 

20. Very often the legal tender quality had bccn granted to these banknotes 
at a time when they still were money-wbstitutes and as such equal to money in 
their exchange value. At that time the decree had no catallactic importance. Now 
it becomes important because the market no longer considers them money- 
substitutes. 

Human Action 

things which are not reflected in the sheets of the ledger; there are 
virtues and achievements, vices and crimes that do not Ieave any 
traces in the accoints. But as far as a man is integrated into socia1 life 
and activities, as far as he contributes to the joint effort of society and 
his contributions are appreciated by his fellow men, and as far as 
he consumes what is or could be sold and bought on the market, the 
information conveyed is complete. 

If we combine the balances of payments of a definite number of 
individuals and Ieave out of account the items referring to trans- 
actions between the members of this group, we draw up the group's 
balance of payment. This balance tells us how the members of the 
group, considered as an integrated complex of people, are connected 
with the rest of the market society. Thus we can draw up the balance 
of payments of the members of the New York Bar, of the Belgian 
farmers, of the residents of Paris, or of those of the Swiss Canton of 
Bern. Statisticians are mostly interested in establishing the balance of 
payments of the residents of the various countries which are organized 
as independent nations. 

While an individual's balance of payments convcys exhaustive in- 
formation about his social position, a group's balance discloses much 
less. It says nothing about the mutual relations between the members 
of the group. The greater the group is and the less homogeneous its 
members are, the more defective is the information vouchsafed by 
the balance of payments. The balance of payments of 1,atvia tells 
more about the conditions of the Latvians than the United States 
balance of payments about the conditions of the Americans. If one 
wants to describe a country's social and economic condition, one 
does not need to deal with every single inhabitant's personal balance 
of payments. But one must not form other groups than such as are 
composed of members who arc by and large homogeneous in their 
social standing and their economic activities. 

Reading balances of payments is thus very instructive. Howcver, 
one must know how to interpret them, to guard against popular 
fallacies. 

It is customary to list separately the monetary and the nonmonetary 
items of a country's balance of payments. One calls thc balance 
favorable if there is a surplus of the imports of money and bullion 
over the exports of money and bullion. One calls the balance un- 
favorable if the exports of money and bullion exceed the imports. 
This terminology stems from inveterate Mercantilist errors unfortu- 
nately still surviving in spite of the devastating criticisms of the 
economists. The imports and exports of money and buIlion are viewed 


Indirect Exchange 

as the unintentional outcome of the configuration of the nonmone- 
tary items of the balance of payments. This opinion is utterly fal- 
lacious. An excess in the exports of money and bullion is not the 
product of an unhappy concatenation of circumstances that befalls 
a nation like an act of God. It is the result of the fact that the residents 
of the country concerned are intent upon reducing the amount of 
money held and upon buying goods instead. This is why the balance 
of payments of the gold-producing countries is as a rule "unfavor- 
able"; this is why the balance of payments of a country substituting 
fiduciary media for a part of its money stock is "unfavorable" as 
long as this process goes on. 

No provident action on the part of a paternal authority is required 
lest a country lose its whole money stock by an unfavorable balance 
of payments. Things are in this regard not different between the 
personal balances of payments of individuals and those of groups. 
Neither are they different between the balances of payments of a 
city or a district and those of a sovereign nation. No govcrnmcnt 
interfcrence is needed to prevent the residents of New York from 
spending all their money in dealings with the other forty-seven states 
of the Union. As long as any American attaches any weight to the 
keeping of cash, he will spontaneously take charge of the matter. 
Thus he will contribute his share to the maintenance of an adequate 
supply of money in his country. Bnt if no American were interested 
in keeping, any cash holding, no Sovernment measure concerning 
foreign trade and the settlement of jntcrnational payments could 
prevent an outflow of America's total monetary stock. A rigidly en- 
forced embargo upon the exportation of money and bullion would 
be required. 

15. Interlocal Exchange Rates 
Let us first assume that there is only one kind of money. Then 
with regard to money's purchasing power at various places the same 
is valid as with regard to commodity prices. The final price of cotton 
in IAiverpool cannot exceed thc final price in Houston, Texas, by 
more than thc cost of transportation. As soon as the price in Liver- 
pool rises to a higher point, merchants will ship cotton to Liverpool 
and thus will bring about a tendency toward a return to the final 
price. The price of an order for the payment of a definite amount of 
guilders in Amsterdam cannot rise in New York above the amount 
determined by the costs involved by reminting the coins, shipment, 
insurance, and the interest during {he period required for all these 
manipulations. As soon as the difference rises above this point-the 


Human Action 

gold export point-it becomes profitable to ship gold from New York 
to Amsterdam. Such shipments force the guilder exchange rate in 
New York down below the gold export point. A difference between 
the configuration of interlocal exchange rates for commodities and 
those for money is brought about by the fact that as a rule commodi- 
ties move only in one direction, namcly, from the places of surplus 
production to those of surplus consumption. Cotton is shipped from 
Houston to Liverpool and not from Liverpool to Houston. Its price is 
lower in Houston than in Liverpool by the amount of shipping costs. 
But money is shipped now this way, now that. 

The error of those who try to interpret the fluctuations of the 
interlocal exchange rates and the interlocal shipments of money as 
determined by the configuration of the nonmonetary items of the 
balance of payments is that they assign to money an exceptional posi- 
tion. They do not see that with regard to interIoca1 exchange rates 
there is no difference between money and commodities. If cotton 
trade between Houston arid Liverpool is possible at all, the cotton 
prices at these two places cannot differ by more than the total amount 
of costs required for shipment. In the same way in which there is a 
flow of cotton from the southern states of the United States to 
Europe, gold flows from the gold-producing countries like South 
Africa to Europe. 

L:t us disregard the case of the gold-producing countries and let 
us assun e that the individuals and firms trading with one another on 
the basis of the gold standard do not have the intention of changing 
the size of their cash holdings, From their purchases and sales, claims 
are generat:d which necessitate interlocal payments. But according 
to our assumption these interlocal payments are equal in amount. The 
amount that thc residents of A have to pay to the rcsidents of B is 
equal to the amount that the residents of B have to pay to the residents 
of A. It is therefore possible to save the costs of shipping gold from 
A to B and from B to A. Claims and debts can be settled by a sort of 
interlocal clearing. It is merely a technical problem whether this 
evening up is affected by an interlocal clearinghouse organization or 
by the turnovers of a special market for foreign exchange. At any rate, 
the price which a resident of A (or of B) has to pay for a payment 
due in B (or in A) is kept within the margins determined by the 
shipment costs. It cannot rise above the par value by more than the 
shipment costs (gold export point) and cannot fall below the ship- 
ment costs (gold import point). 
It may happen that-all our other assun~ptions remaining unaltered 
-there is a temporal discrepancy between the payments due from 


hdirect Exchange 

A to U and those from B to A. Then an interlocal shipment of gold 
can only be avoided by the interposition of a credit transaction, If 
the importer who today has to pay from A to B can buy at the mar- 
ltet of foreign exchange only such claims against residents of B as fall 
dlle in ninety days, he can save the costs of shipping gold by borrow- 
ing the sum concerned in B for a period of ninety days. The dealers 
in foreign exchange will resort to this makeshift if the costs of bor- 
rowing in B do not exceed the costs of borrowing in A by more than 
double the costs of shipping gold. If the cost of shipping gold is 1/8 per 
cent, they will be ready to pay for a three months' loan in B up to 

I per cent (pro anno) more as interest than corresponds to the state 
of the money-market intercst rate at which, in the absence of such 
requirements for interlocal payments, credit transactions between 
A and B would be effected. 

It is permissible to express these facts by contending that the daily 
state of the baIance of payments t)etween A and B determines the 
point at which, within the margins drawn by the goId export point 
and the gold import point, the foreign exchange rates are fixed. But 
one must not forget to add that this happens only if the residents of 
A and of B do not intend to change the size of their cash holdings. 
Only because this is the case does it become possibIe to avoid the 
transfer of gold altogether and to keep foreign exchange rates within 
the limits drawn by the two gold points. If the residents of A want 
to reduce their cash holdings and those of R want to increase theirs, 
gold must be shipped from A to B and the rate for cable transfer B 
reaches in A the gold export poinr. Then gold is sent from A to B 
in the same way in which cotton is regularly sent from the United 
States to Europe. The rate of cable transfer B reaches the gold export 
point because the residents of A are selling gold to those of B, not be- 
cause their balance of payments is unfavorable. 

All this is valid with regard to any payments to be transacted be- 

tween various places. It makes no difference whether the cities con- 

cerned belong to the same sovereign nation or to different sovereigl~ 

nations. However, government interference has considerably changed 

the conditions. All governments have created institutions which make 

it possible for the residents of their countries to make interlocal 

domestic payments at par. The costs involved in shipment of cur- 

rency from one place to another are borne either by the treasury or 

by ;he country's central bank system or by another government 

~hnksuch as the postal savings banks of various European countries. 

Thus there is no longer any market for domestic interlocal exchange. 

The public is not charged more for an interlocal order to pay than 


45 2 Human Action 

for a local one or, if the charge is slightly different, it no longer has 
any reference to the fluctuations of the interlocal movements of 
currency within the country. It is this government interference which 
has sharpened the difference between domestic payment and pay- 
ment abroad. Domestic payments are transacted at par, while with 
regard to foreign payments fluctuations occur within the limits 
drawn by the gold points. 

If more than one kind of money is uscd as medium of exchange, 
the mutual exchange ratio between thcm is determined by their 
purchasing power. The final prices of the various commodities, as 
expressed in each of the two or several kinds of money, are in pro- 
portion to each other. The final exchange ratio between the various 
kinds of money reflects their purchasing power with regard to the 
commodities. ff any discrepancy appears, opportunity for profitable 
transactions presents itself and the endeavors of businessmen eager 
to take advantage of this opportunity tend to make it disappear again. 
The purchasing-power parity theory of foreign exchange is merely 
the application of the gcneral theorems conccrning the determination 
of prices to the special case of the coexistence of various kinds of 
money. 

It does not matter whcthcr the various kinds of money coexist 
in the same territory or whether their use is limited to distinct areas. 
In any case the mutual exchange ratio between them tends to a final 
state at which it no longcr makes any difference whcthcr one buys 
and sells against this or that kind of money. As far as costs of intcr- 
local transfer come into play, these costs must be added or deducted. 

The changes in purchasi~g power do not occur at the same time 
with regard to all commodities and services. Let us consider again 
the practically very important instance of an inflation in one coun- 
try only. ~hc 

increase in the quantity of domestic credit money or 
fiat money affects at first only the prices of somc commodities and 
services. The prices of the othcr commodities remain for some time 
stiji ac their previous stand. Tne exchange rario between the domestic 
currency and the foreign currencies is determined on the bourse, a 
market organized and managed according to the pattern and the 
commercial customs of the stock exchange. The dealers on this special 
market are quicker than the rest of thc people in anticipating future 
changes. Consequently the price structure of the market for foreign 
exchange reflects the new7 money relation sooner than the prices of 
many commodities and services. As soon as the domestic inflation be- 
gins to affect the prices of some con~rnodities, at any rate long before 
it has exhausted all its effects upon the greater part of the prices of 


Indirect Exchange 453 

commodities and services, the price of foreign exchange tends to rise 
to rhe point corresponding to the final state of domestic prices and 
wage rates. 

This fact has been entirely misinterpreted. People failed to realize 
that the rise in foreign exchange rates merely anticipates the move- 
ment of domestic commodity prices. They explained the boom in 
forcign exchange as an outcome of an unfavorable balance of pay- 
ments. The demand for foreign exchange, they maintained, has been 
increased by a deterioration of the balance of trade or of other items 
of the balance of payments, or simply by sinister machinations on the 
part of unpatriotic speculators. The higher prices to be paid for 
foreign exchange cause the domestic prices of imported goods to 
rise. The prices of the domestic products must follow suit because 
otherwisc their low state would encourage business to withhold them 
from domcstic consun~ption and to sell them abroad at a premium. 

The fallacies involved in this popular doctrine can casily be shown. 
If the nominal income of the domestic public had not been increased 
by the inffation, thcy would be forced to restrict their consumption 
cither of imported or of domestic products. In the first case imports 
would drop and in the second case exports would increase. Thus the 
balance of trade would again be brought back to what the Mercan- 
tilists call a favorable state. 

Pressed hard, the LMercantilists cannot help admitting the correct- 
ness of this reasoning. But, they say, it applies only to normal trade 
conditions. It does not take into account the state of affairs in coun- 
tries which arc under the necessity of importing vital commodities 
such as food and essential raw materials. The importation of such 
goods cannot be curtailed below a certain minimum. They are im- 
ported no matter what prices must he paid for them. If the foreign 
exchange required for importing them cannot be procured by an 
adequate amount of exports, the balance of trade becomes unfavor- 
able and the foreign exchange ratcs must rise more and more. 

This is no less illusory than all other Mercantilist ideas. However 
urgcnt and vital an individual's or a group of individuals' demand 
for some goods may be, they can satisfy it on the market only by 
paying the market price. If an Austrian wants to buy Canadian 
wheat, he must pay the market price in Canadian dollars. He must 
procure these Canadian dollars by exporting goods either directly 
to Canada or to some other country. He does not increase the amount 
of Canadian dollars available by paying higher prices (in schillings, 
the Austrian domestic currency) for Canadian dollars. Moreover, 
he cannot afford to pay such higher prices (in schillings) for imported 


Human Action 

wheat if his income (in schillings) remains unchanged. Only if the 
Austrian Govcrnrnent embarks upon an inflationary policy and thus 
increases the number of schillings in the pockets of its citizens, are 
the Austrians in a position to continue to buy the quantities of 
Canadian wheat they used to buy without curtailing other expendi- 
tures. If there were no domestic inflation, any rise in the price of im- 
ported goods would result either in a drop in their consumption or in 
a restriction in the consumption of other goods. Thus the process 
of readjustment as described above would have come into motion. 

If a man lacks the money to buy bread from his neighbor, the village 
baker, the cause is not to be seen in an alleged scarcity of money. 
The cause is that this man did not succeed in earning the amount of 
money needed either by selling goods or by rendering services for 
which people are prepared to pay. The samc is true with regard to 
international trade. A country may be distressed on account of the 
fact that it is at a loss to sell abroad as tnany commodities as it would 
have to sell in order to buy all the food its citizens want. But this 
does not mean that foreign exchange is scarce. It means that the 
residents are poor. And domestic inflation is certainly not an ap- 
propriate means to remove this poverty. 

Keither has speculation any reference to the determination of 
foreign exchange rates. The speculators merely anticipate the ex-
pected alterations. If they err, if their opinion that an inflation is in 
progress is wrong, the structure of prices and foreign exchange rates 
will not correspond to their anticipations and they will have to pay 
for their mistakes by losses. 

The doctrine according to which foreign exchange rates are de- 
termined by the balance of payments is based upon an illicit general- 
ization of a special case. If two places, A and B, use the same kind of 
money and if the residents do not want to make any changes in the 
size of their cash holdings, over a given period of time the amount of 
money paid from the residents of A to those of B equals the amount 
paid frotn the residents of B to those of A and all payments can be 
settled without shipping money from A to B or from R to A. Then 
the rate of cabIe transfer B in A cannot rise above a point slightly 
below the gold export point and cannot drop below a point slightly 
above the gold import point, and vice versa. W7ithin this margin the 
daiIy state of the balance of payments determines thc daily state of the 
foreign exchange rate. This is the case only becausc neither the 
residents of A nor those of B want to alter the amount of their cash 
holdings. If the residents of A want to decrease their cash holdings 
and those of B to increase theirs, money is shipped from A to B and 


lndirect Exchange 455 

the cable rate B reaches in A the gold export point. But money is not 
shipped because A's balance of payments has become unfavorable. 
TVhat is called by the Mercantilists an unfavorable balance of pay- 
ments is the effect of a deliberate restriction of cash holdings on the 
part of the citizens of A and a deliberate increase in cash holdings on 
the part of the citizens of B. If no resident of A were ready to rcduce 
his cash holding, such an outflow of money from A could never 
materialize. 

?he difference between the tradc in money and that in the vendible 
commodities is this: As a rule commodities move on a one-way road, 
viz., from the places of surpIus production to those of surplus con- 
sumption. Consequently the price of a certain commodity in the 
places of surplus ~roduction is as a ruIe lower by the amount of ship- 
ping costs than in the places of surplus consumption. Things are dif- 
ferent with money if we do not takc into account the conditions of 
the gold-mining countries and of those countries whose residents 
dcliberately aim at altering the size of their cash holdings. Money 
moves now this way, now that. At one time a country exports money, 
at another time it imports moncy. Every cxporting country very 
soon becomes an importing country precisely on account of its 
previous exports. For this reason alone it is possibIe to save the costs 
of shipping money by the interplay of the market for foreign ex- 
change. 

16. Interest Ratcs and the Money Relation 
A4oney plays in credit transactions the same role it plays in all other 
business transactions. As a rule loans are granted in money, and inter- 
est and principal are paid in money. The payments resulting from 
such dealings influence the size of cash holding onIy temporarily. The 
recipients of loans, interest, and principal spend the sums received 
either for consumption or for investment. They increase their cash 
holdings only if definite considerations, independent of the inflow of 
the money received, motivate them to act in this way. 

The final state of the market rate of interest is the same for all 
loans of the same character. Differences in the rate of interest are 
caused either by differences in the soundness and trustworthiness of 
the debtor or by differences in the terms of the contract.21 Differences 
in interest rates which are not brought about by these differences in 
conditions tend to disappear. The applicants ?or credits approach 
the lenders who ask a lower rate of interest. The lenders are eager 

2 I. For a more elaborate analysis, see below, pp. 536-545. 


Human Action 

to cater to people who are ready to pay higher interest rates. Things 
on the money market are the same as on all other markets. 

With regaid to interlocal credit transactions the interlocal exchange 
rates are to be taken into account as well as differences in the mone- 
tary standard if there are any. Ixt us contemplate the case of two 
countries, A and 8.A is under the gold standard, B under the silver 
standard. The lender who considers lending money from A to B must 
first sell gold against silver and later, at the termination of the loan, 
silver against gold. If at that later date the price of silver has dropped 
as against gold, the principal repaid by the debtor (in silver) will 
buy a smaller amount of gold than that expended by the creditor 
when he previously embarked upon the transaction. He will there- 
fore only venture lending in B if the difference in the market rate 
of interest between A and B is large enough to cover an expected fall 
in the price of silver as against gold. The tendency toward an equaliza- 
tion of the market rate of interest for short-term loans which prevails 
if A and R are both under the same monetary standard is seriously im- 
paired under a diversity of standards. 

If A and B are both under the same standard, it is impossible for 
the banks of A to expand credit if those of B do not espouse the same 
policy. Credit expansion in A malses prices rise, and short-term inter- 
est rates drop in A, while prices and interest rates in B remain un- 
changed. Consequently exports from A drop and imports to A in- 
crease. In addition, the money lenders of A become eager to lend on 
the short-term loan market of B. The result is an external drain from 
A which makes the money reserves of A's banks dwindIe. If the 
banks of A do not abandon their expansionist policy, they will be- 
come insolvent. 

This process has been entirely misinterpreted. People speak of an 
important and vital function which a country's central bank has to 
fulfill on behalf of the nation. It is, they say, the central bank's sacred 
duty to preserve the stability of foreign exchange rates and to protect 
the natibn's gold reserve .against attacks on the part of foreign 
speculators and their domestic abettors. The truth is that all that a 
central bank does lest its gold reserve evaporate is done for the sake 
of the preservation of its own solvency. It has jeopardized its financial 
position by embarking upon credit kxpansion and must now undo 
its previous action in order to avoid its disastrous consequences. Its 
expansionist policy has encountered the obstacIes limiting the issuance 
of fiduciary media. 

The use of the terminology of warfare is inappropriate in dealing 
with monetary matters, as it is in the treatment of all other catallactic 


Indirect Exchange 

problems. There is no such thing as a "war" between the central banks. 
No sinister forces arc "attacking" a bank's position and threatening 
the stability of foreign exchange rates. No "defender" is needed to 
'Lpr~tc~t"

a nation's currency system. It is, moreover, not true that 
what prevents a nation's central bank or its private banks from lower- 
ing the domestic market rate of interest is considerations of the 
preservation of the gold standard and of forcign exchange stability 
and of frustrating the machinations of an international combine of 
capitalistic moneylenders. The market rate of interest cannot be 
lowered by a credit expansion except for a short time, and even then 
it brings about all those effects which the theory of the trade cyck 
describes. 

When the Bank of England redeemed a badmote issued according 
to the terms of the contract, it did not render unselfishly a vital service 
to the British people. It simply did what every housewife does in 
paying the grocer's bill. The idea that there is some special merit in 
a central bank's fulfillment of its voluntarily assumed responsibilities 
could originate only because again and again governments granted 
to these banks the privilege of denying to their clicnts the payments 
to which they had a legal title. In fact, the central banks became more 
and more subordinate offices of the treasuries, mere tools for the 
performance of credit expansion and inflation. It does not make any 
difference practically whether they are or are not owned by the gov- 
ernment and directly managed by government officials. In effect 
the banks granting circulation credit are in every country today only 
affiliates of the treasuries. 

There is but one means of keeping a local and national currencJr 
permanently at par with gold and foreign exchange: unconditional 
redemption. The central bank has to buy at the parity rate any amount 
of gold and forcign exchange offered against domestic banknotes 
and deposit currency; on the other hand it has to sell, without dis- 
crimination, any amount of gold and foreign exchange asked for 
by people ready to pay the parity price in domestic banknotes, coins, 
or deposit currency. Such was the policy of central banks under the 
gold standard. Such was also the policy of those governments and 
central banks which had adopted the currency system commonly 
known under the name of the gold exchange standard. The onli 
difference between the "orthodox" or classical gold standard as it 
existed in Great Britain from the early 'twenties of the nineteenth 
century until the outbreak of the first WorId War and in other 
countries on the one hand, and the gold exchange standard on the 
other, concerned the use of gold coins on the domestic market. Under 


Human Action 

the classical gold standard a part of the cash holdings of the citizens 
consisted in gold coins and the rest in money substitutes. Under 
the gold exchange standard the cash holdings consisted entirely in 
money-substitutes. 

Pegging a certain rate of foreign exchange is tantamount to redemp- 
tion at this rate. 
A foreign exchange equalization account, too, can succeed in its 
operations only as far as it clings to the same methods. 

The reasons why European governments in the last few years have 
preferred foreign cxchange equalization accounts to the operation 
of central banks are obvious. Central bank legislation was an achieve- 
ment of liberal governments or of governments which did not dare 
to challenge openly, at least in the conduct of financial policies, public 
opinion of the liberal countries. The operations of central banks were 
therefore adjusted to economic freedom. For that reason they were 
considered unsatisfactory in this age of rising totaIitarianism. The 
main characteristics of the operation of a foreign exchange equaliza- 
tion account as distinguished from central bank policy are: 

I. The authorities keep the transactions of the account secret. The 
laws have obliged the central banks to publicize their actual status at 
short intervals, as a rule every week. But the status of the foreign ex- 
change equalization accounts is known only to the initiated. Official- 
dom renders a report to the public only after a lapse of time when 
the figures are of interest to historians alone and of no use whatever 
to the businessman. 
z. This secrecy makes it possible to discriminate against people 
not in great favor with the authorities. In many continental countries 
of Europe it resulted in scandalous corruption. Other governments 
used the power to discriminate to the detriment of businessmen be- 
longing to linguistic or religious minorities or supporting opposition 
parties. 
3. A parity is no longer fixed by a law duly promulgated by parlia- 
menr: and therefore known to every citizen. The determination de- 
pends upon the arbitrariness of bureaucrats. From time to time the 
newspapers reported: The Ruritanian currency is weak. A more 
correct description would have been: The Ruritanian authorities have 
decided to raise the price of foreign ~xchange.?~ 
A foreign exchange equalization account is not a magic wand for 
remedying the evils of inflation. It cannot apply any means other 
than those available to "orthodox" central banks. A& it must, like 

22. Sec below, pp. 780-783. 

Indirect Exchange 

the central banks, fail in the endeavors to keep foreign exchange rates 
at par if there is domestic inflation and credit expansion. 

It has been asserted that the "orthodox" rnethods of fighting an 
external drain by raising thc rate of discount no longer work because 
nations are no longer prepared to comply with "the rules of the 
game." Now, the gold standard is not a game, but a social institution. 
Its working does not dcpend on the preparedness of any people to 
observe some arbitrary rules. It is controlled by the operation of in- 
exorablc economic law. 

The critics give point to their objection by citing the fact that 
in the interwar period a rise in the rate of discount failed to stop the 

external drain, i.e., the outflow of specie and the transfer of deposits 
into foreign countries. But this phcnomenon was caused by the 
governments' anti-gold and pro-inflation policies. If a man expects 

that he will lose 40 per cent of his balance by an impending devalua- 
tion, he will try to transfer his deposit into another country and will 
not change his mind if the bank rate in the country planning a dc- 
valuation rises I or z per cent. Such a rise in the rate of drscount is 
obviously not a compensation for a loss ten or twenty or even forty 
tilnes greater. Of course, the gold standard cannot work if govern- 
ments are eager to sabotage its operations. 

I 7. Secondary Media of Exchange 

The use of money does not remove the differences which exist 
between the various nonmonetary goods with regard to their mar- 
ketability. Tn the money economy there is a very substantial difference 
between the marketability of money and that of the vendible goods. 
But there remain differences between the various specimens of this 
latter group. For some of them it is easier to find without &lay a 
buyer ready to pay the highest pricc which, under the state of the 
market, can possibly be attained. With others it is morc difficult, 
,4 first-class bond is more marketable than a house in 3 city's main 
streer, and an old fur coat is more marketable than an autograph of 
an eighteenth-century statesman. One no longer compares the mar- 
ketability of the various vendible goods with the perfect market- 
ability of money. One merely compares the degree of marketabil- 
ity of the various commodities. One may speak of the secondary 
marketability of the vendible goods. 

He who owns a stock of goods of a high degree of secondary mar- 
ketability is in a position to restrict his cash holding. He can expect 


Human Action 
that when one day it is necessary for him to increase his cash holding 
he will be in a position to sell thesc goods of a high dcgree of secondary 
marketability without delay at the highest price attainable at the 
market. Thus the size of a man's or a firm's cash holding is influencetl 
b\; whether or not he owns a stock of goods with a high degree of 
sfcondary marketability. The size of cash holding and the expcnsc 
incurred in keeping it can be reduced if income-producing goods of 
a high degree of secondary marketability are availabie. 
Consequently there emerges a specific demand for such goods on 
the part of people eager to kcep them in order to reduce the costs of 
cash holding. The priccs of these goods are partly determined by 
this specific demand; they would be lower in its absence. Thesc goods 
are secondary media of exchange, as it were, and their exchange value 
is the rcsultant of two kinds of demand: the demand rclated to their 
services as secondary media of exchange, and the demand related to 
the other services they render. 
The costs incurred by holding cash are equal to thc amount of 
interest which the sum concerned would havc borne when invested. 
The cost incurred by holding a stock of secondary media of exchange 
consists in the difference between the interest yield of the securities 
empIoyed for this purpose and the higher yield of other securities 
which differ from the former only in regard to their lower market- 
ability and are thereforc not suitcd for the role of secondary media 
of exchange. 
From time immemorial jewels have been used as secondary media 
of exchange. Today the secondary media of exchange commonly 
used arc: 

I. Claims against banks, bankers, and savings banks which-al- 
though not money-substitutes "-arc daily maturing or can be with-
drawn on short notice. 
z. Bonds whose volume and popularity are so great that it is, as a 
rule. possible to sell moderate quantities of them without depressing 
thc market. 
;, Finally, sometimes even ccrtain especially marketablc stocks or 
even commodities. 

Of course, the advantages to be expected from lowering the costs 
of holding cash must be confronted with certain hazards incurred. 
The sale of securities and still more that of comrnoditics may only be 
feasible with a loss. This danger is not present with bank balances 
and the hazard of the bank's insolvency is usually negligible. There- 
fore interest-bearing claims against banks and bankers, which can be 

23. For instance, demand deposits not subject to check. 

Indirect Exchange 

withdrawn at short notice, are the most popular secondary media of 
exchange. 

One must not confuse secondary media of exchange with money- 
substitutes. Money-substitutes are in the settlement of payments 
given away and receivcd like money. But the secondary ~nedia of 
exchange must first be exchanged against moncy or money-substitutes 
if one wants to use them-in a roundabout way-for paying or for 
increasing cash holdings. 

Claims employed as secondary media of exchange have, because 
of this ernploymcnt, a broader market and a higher price. The out- 
come of this is that they yield lower interest than claims of the same 
kind which are not fit to serve as secondary media of cxchange. Gov- 
ernment bonds and treasury bills which can be used as secondary 
media of exchange can be floated on conditions more favorable to 
the debtor than loans not suitable for this purpose. The debtors con- 
cerned are therefore eager to organize the market for their certificates 
of indebtedness in such a way as to make them attractivc for those in 
search of secondary media of exchange. Thcy are intent upon making 
it possible for every holder of such securities to sell them or to use 
them as collateral in borrowing under the most reasonablc terms. In 
advertising their bond issues to the public they stress these opportuni- 
ties as a special boon. 

In the same way banks and bankers are intent upon attracting de- 
mand for secondary media of exchange. They offer convenient 
terms to their customers. They try to outdo one another by shorten- 
ing the time allowed for notice. Sometimes they pay interest even 
for money maturing without notice. In this rivalry some banks have 
gone too far and endangered their solvency. 

L. 
Political conditions of the last decades have given to bank balances 
which can be used as secondary media of exchange an increased im-
portance. The governments of almost a11 countries are engaged in a 
campaign against the capiralists. They are intent upon cspropriating 
them by means of taxation and monetary measures. The capitalists 
are eager to protect their property by keeping a pan of their funds 
liquid in order to evade confiscatory measures in time. They beep 
balances with the banks of those countries in which the danger of 
confiscation or currency devaluation is for the moment less than in 
other countries. As soon as the prospects change, they transfer their 
balances into countries which temporarily seem to offer more security. 
It is these funds which people have in mind when speaking of "hot 
money." 

The significance of hot money for the constellation of monetary 


Human Action 

affairs is the outcome of the one-reserve system. In order to make 
it easier for the central banks to embark upon credit expansion, the 
European governments aimed long ago at a concentration of their 
countries' gold. reserves with the central banlis. The other banks 
(the private banks, i.e., those not endowed with special privileges 
and not entitled to issue banknotcs) restrict their cash holdings to the 
requirements of their daily transactions. They no longer keep a 
reserve against their daily maturing liabilities. They do not consider 
it necessary to balance the maturity dates of their liabilities and 
their assets in such a way as to be any day ready to comply unaided 
with their obligations to their creditors. They rely upon the central 
bank. When the creditors want to withdraw more than the "normal" 
arnount, the private banks borrow the funds needed from the central 
bank. A private bank considers itself liquid if it owns a sufficient 
amount either of collateral against which the central bank will lend 
or of bills of exchange which the central bank will redisco~nt.~~ 

When the inflow of hot money began, the private banks of the 
countries in which it was temporarily deposited saw nothing wrong 
in treating these funds in the usual w-ay. They employed the additional 
funds entrusted to them in increasing their loans to business. They 
did not worry about the consequences, although they knew that 
these funds would be withdrawn as soon as any doubts about their 
country's fiscal or monetary policy emerged. The illiquidity of the 
status of these banks was manifest: on the one hand large sums which 
the customers had the right to withdraw at short notice, and on the 
other hand loans to business which could be recovered only at a 
later date. The only cautious method of dealing with hot money 
would have been to keep a reserve of gold and foreign exchange 
big enough to pay back the whole amount in case of a sudden with- 
drawal. Of course, this method would have required the banks to 
charge the customers a commission for keeping their funds safe. 

The showdown came for the Swiss banks on thc day in September, 
1936, on which France devalued the French franc. 'The depositors 
of hot money became frightened; they feared that Switzerland might 
follow the French example. It was to be expected that they would 
all try to transfer their funds immediately to London or New York, 
or even to Paris, which for the immediate coming weeks seemed to 
offer a smaller hazard of currency depreciation. But the Swiss com- 
mercial banks were not in a position to pay back these funds without 

24. All this refers to European conditions. American conditions differ only 
technically, but not economically. However, the hot-money problem is not an 
American problem, as there is, under the present state of affairs, no country 
which a capitalist could deem a safer refuge than the United States. 

Indirect Exchange 

the aid of the National Bank. They had lent them to business-a great 
part to business in countries which, by foreign exchange control, had 
blocked their balances. The only way out would have been for them 
to borrow from the National Bank. Then they would have main- 
tained their own solvency. But the depositors paid would have im- 
mediately asked the hTational Bank for the redemption, in gold or 
foreign exchange, of the banknotes received. If the National Bank 
were not to comply with this request, it would thereby have actually 
abandoned the gold standard and devalued the Swiss franc. If, on the 
other hand, the Bank had redeemed the notes, it would have lost 
the greater part of ics reserve. A panic would have resulted. The 
Swiss then~selves would have tried to procure as much gold and 
foreign exchange as possible. The whole monetary system of the 
country would havc collapsed. 

The only alternative for the Swiss National Bank would havc 
been not to assist the private banks at all. But this would have been 
equivalent to the insolvency of the country's most important credit 
institutions. 

Thus for the Swiss Governincnt no choice was left. It had only 
one means to prevent an economic catastrophe: to follow suit forth- 
with and to devalue the Swiss franc. The matter did not brook delay. 

By and large, Great Britain, at the outbreak of the war in September, 
1939, had to face similar conditions. The City of 1,ondon was once 
the world's banking center. It has long since lost this function. But 
foreigners and citizens of the Dominions still kept, on the eve of the 
war, considerable short-term balances in the British banks. Besides, 
there w-ere the large deposits due to the central banks in the "sterling 
area." If the British Government had not frozcn all these balances by 
means of foreign exchange restrictions, the insolvency of the British 
banks would have become manifest. Foreign exchange control was 
a disguised moratorium for the banks. It relieved them from the 
plight of having to confess publicly their inability to fulfill their 
obligations. 

18. The Inflationist View of History 
A very popular doctrine maintains that progressive lowering of 
the monetary unit's purchasing power played a decisive role in his- 
torical evoIution. It is asserted that mankind would not have reached 
its present state of well-being if the supply of money had not in- 
creased to a greater extent than the demand for money. The result- 
ing fall in purchasing power, it is said, was a necessary condition of 
economic progress. The intensification of the division of labor and 


Human Action 

the continuous growth of capital accumulation, which have centupled 
the productivity of labor, could ensue only in a world of progressive 
price rises. Inflation creates prosperity and wealth; deflation distress 
and economic decay.25 A survey of political literature and of the 
ideas that guided for centuries the monetary and credit policies of 
the nations reveals that this opinion is almost generally accepted. In 
spite of all warnings on the part of economists it is still today the core 
of the layman's economic philosophy. It is no less the essence of the 
teachings of Lord Keynes and his disciples in both hemispheres. 

The popularity of inflationism is in great part due to deep-rooted 
hatred of creditors. Inflation is considered just because it favors 
debtors at the expense of creditors. However, the inflationist view 
of history which we have to deaI with in this section is only loosely 
related to this anticreditor argument. Its assertion that "expansion- 
ism" is the driving force of economic progress and that "restriction- 
ism" is the worst of all evils is mainly based on other arguments. 

Jt is obvious that the problems raised by the inflationist doctrine 
cannot he solved by a recourse to the teachings of historical experi- 
ence. It is beyond doubt that the history of prices shows, by and 
large, a continuous, although sometimes for short periods inter-
rupted, upward trend. It is of course impossible to establish this fact 
otherwise than by historica1 understanding. Catallactic precision can- 
not be applied to historical problems. The endeavors of some histo- 
rians and statisticians to trace back the changes in the purchasing 
power of the precious metals for centuries, and to measure them, are 
futile. It has been shown already that all attempts to measure economic 
nlagnitudes are based on entirely falIacious assumptions and display 
ignorance of the fundamental principles both of economics and of 
history. But what history by means of its specific methods can tell 
us in this field is enough to justify the assertion that the purchasing 
power of money has for centuries shown a tendency to fall. With 
regard to this point all people agree. 

Hut this is not the proh!err? tc!be e!ucidatcd. T!x ql~esda!~

is v+et!?er 
the fall in purchasing power was or was not an indispensable factor 
in the evolution which led from the poverty of ages gone hy to the 
more satisfactory conditions of modern Western capitalism. This 
question must bc answered without reference to the historical ex-
perience, which can be and always is interpreted in different ways, 
and to which supporters and adversaries of every theory and of every

explanation of history refer as a proof of their mutually contradic- 
tory and incompatible statements. What is needed is a clarification 
of the effects of changes in purchasing power on the division of labor, 
the accumulation of capital, and tecl~nological improvement. 

In dealing with this problem one cannot satisfy oneself with the 
refutation of the arguments advanced by the inflationists in support 
of their thesis. The absurdity of these arguments is so manifest that 
their refutation and exposure is easy indeed. From its very beginnings 
economics has shown again and again that assertions concerning the 
alleged blessings of an abundance of money and the alleged disasters 
of a scarcity of money are the outcome of crass errors in reasoning. 
The endeavors of the apostles of inflationism and expansionism to 
refute the correctness of the economists' teachings have failed utterly. 

The only relevant question is this: Is it possible or not to lower 
the rate of interest lastingly by means of credit expansion? This 
problem will be treated exhaustively in the chapter dealing with the 
jnterconnection between the money relation and the rate of interest. 
There it wilI be shown whar the consequences of booms created by 
credit expansion must be. 

13ut we must: ask ourselves at this point of our inquiries whether it 
is not possibIe that there are other reasons which could be advanced 
in favor of the inflationary interpretation of history. Is it not pos- 
sible that the champions of inflationism have neglected to resort to 
some valid arguments which could support their stand? It is certainly 
necessary to approach the issue from every possible avcnue. 

Let us think of a world in which the quantity of money is rigid. 
At an early stage of history the inhasitants of this world have pro- 
duced the whole quantity of the commodity employed for the mone- 
tary service which can possibly be produced. A further increase in 
the quantity of money is out of the question. Fiduciary media are 
unknown. All money-substitutes-the subsidiary coins included-are 
money-certificates. 

On these assumptions the intensification of the division of labor, the 
evolution from the economic self-sufficiency of ho~iseholds, villages, 
districts, and countries to the world-embracing market system of 
the nineteenth century, the progressive accumulation of capital, 
and the itnprovement of technological methods of production wonld 
have resdted in a continuous trend toward falling prices. Would 
such a rise in the purchasing power of the monetary unit have stopped 
the evolution of capitalism? 

The average businessn~an will answer this question in the affirma- 
tive. Living and acting in an environment in which a slow but continu- 


Hzman Action 

ous fall in the monctary unit's purchasing power is deemed normal, 
necessary, and beneficial, he simply cannot comprehend a different 
state of affairs. He associates the notions of rising prices and profits 
on the one hand and of falling prices and losses on the other. The 
fact that there are bear operations too and that great fortunes have 
been made by bears does not shake his dogmatism. These are, he says, 
merely speculative transactions of people eager to profit from the 
fa11 in the prices of goods already produced and available. Creative 
innovations, new investments, and the application of improved techno- 
logical methods require the inducement brought about by the expecta- 
tion of price rises. Economic progress is possible only in a world of 
rising prices. 

This opinion is untenable. In a world of a rising purchasing power 
for the monetary unit everybody's mode of thinking would have 
adjusted itself to this state of affairs, just as in our actual world it has 
adjusted itself to a falling purchasing power of the monetary unit. 
Today everybody is prepared to consider a rise in his nominal or 
monetary income as an improvement of his material well-being. 
People's attention is directed more toward the rise in nominal wage 
rates and the money equivalent of wealth than to the increase in the 
supply of commodities. In a world of rising purchasing power for the 
monetary unit they would concern themselves more with the fall in 
living costs. This would bring into clearer relief the fact that economic 
progress consists primarily in making the amcnitics of life more easily 
accessible. 

In the conduct of business, reflections concerning the secular trend 
of prices do not play any role whatever. Entrepreneurs and investors 
do not bother about secular trends. What guides their actions is their 
opinion about the movement of prices in the coming weeks, months, 
or at most years. They do not heed the general movement of all 
prices. What matters for them is the existence of discrepancies be- 
tween the prices of the complementary factors of production and the 
ar?ticipated prices nf the pmdum. No hnsinessmm emharks unonr---a-
definite production project because he beIieves that the prices, i.e., the 
prices of all goods and services, will rise. He engages himself if he 
believes that he can profit from a difference between the prices of 
goods of various orders. In a world with a secular tendency toward 
falling prices, such opportunities for earning profit will appear in the 
same way in which they appear in a world with a secular trend to- 
ward rising prices. The expectation of a general progressive upward 
movement of all prices does not bring about intensified production 
and improvement in well-being. It results in the "flight to real values," 


Indirect Exchange 

in the crack-up boom and the complete breakdown of the monetary 
system. 

If the opinion that the prices of a11 comnlodities will drop becomes 
general, the short-term rnarket rate of interest is lowered by the 
amount of the negative price premium." Thus the entrepreneur 
employing borrowed funds is secured against the consequences of 
such a drop in prices to the same extent to which, under conditions of 
rising prices, the lender is secured through the price premium against 
the consequences of falling purchasing power. 

A secular tendency toward a rise in the monetary unit's purchasing 
pow-er would require rules of thumb on the part of businessmen and 
investors other than those developed under the secular tendencv to- 
ward a fall in its purchasing power. But it would certainly not in- 
fluence substantially the course of economic affairs. It would not re-
move the urge of people to improve their material well-being as far 
as possible by an appropriate arrangement of production. It would 
not deprive the economic system of the factors making for material 
improvement, namely, the striving of enterprising promoters after 
profit and the readiness of the public to buy those commodities 
which are apt to provide them the greatest satisfaction at the low- 
est costs. 

Such observations arc certainly not a plea for a policy of deflation. 
They imply merely a refutation of the ineradicable inflationist fables. 
They unmask the illusiveness of Lord Keynes's doctrine that the 
source of poverty and distress, of depression of trade, and of unem- 
ployment is to be seen in a "contractionist pressure." It is not true 
that "a deflationary pressure . . . would have . . .prevented the 
development of modern industry." It is not true that credit expansion 
brings about the "n~iracle . . . of turning a stone into bread." 27 

Economics recommends neither inflationary nor deflationary pol- 
icy. It does not urge the governments to tamper with the market's 
choice of a medium of exchange. It establishes only the following 
truths: 

I. By committing itself to an inflationary or deflationary policy 
a government does not promote the public welfare, the common- 
weal, or the interests of the whole nation. It merely favors one or 
several groups of the population at the expense of other groups. 
2. It is impossible to know in advance which group will be favored

by a definite inflationary or deflationary measure and to what extent. 
These effects depend on the whole complex of the market data in-
volved. They also depend largely on the speed of the inflationary or 
deflationary movements and may be completely reversed with the 
progress of these movements. 

3. At any rate, an expansion results in misinvestment of capital 
and overconsumption. It leavcs the nation as a whole poorer, not 
richer. These problcms are dealt with in Chapter XX. 
4. Continued inflation must finally end in the crack-up boom, the 
complete breakdown of the currency system. 
5. Deflationary policy is costly for the treasury and unpopular with 
the masses. Rut inflationary policy is a boon for the treasury and very 
popular with thc ignorant. PracticaIly, the danger of deflation is but 
slight and the danger of inflation tremendous. 
19. The Gold Standard 
Men have chosen the precious metals gold and silver for the money 
service on account of thcir mineralogical, physical, and chemical 
features. The use of money in a market economy is a praxeologically 
necessary fact. That gold-and not something else-is used as money 
is merely a historical fact and as such cannot be conceived by catal- 
lactics. In monetary history too, as in all other branches of history, 
one must resort to'historical understanding. If one takes pleasure in 
calling the gold standard a "barbarous relic," 28 one cannot object to 
the application of the same tern1 to every historically determined in- 
stitution. Then the fact that the British speak English-and not 
Danish, German, or French-is a barbarous relic too, and every 
Rricon who opposes the substitution of Esperanto for English is no 
less dogmatic and orthodox than those who do not wax rapturous 
about the plans for a managed currency. 

The demonetization of silver and the establishment of gold mono- 
rr~ctallisnl was the outcome of delibcrate government interference 
with monetary matters. It is pointless to raise the question concern- 
ing what would have happened in the absence of these policies. But 
it must not be forgotten that it was not the intention of the govern- 
ments to establish the gold standard. What the governments aimed at 
was the double standard. They wanted to substitute a rigid, govern- 
ment-decreed exchange ratio between gold and silver for the fluctuat- 
ing market ratios betu-een the independently cocxktent gold and 

28. Lord Keynes in the speech delivered before the House of Lords, may 23.

silver coins. The monetary doctrines underlying these endeavors 
~nisconstrued the market phenomena in that complete way in which 
only bureaucrats can misconstrue them. The attempts to create a 
double standard of both metals, gold and silver, failed lamentably. 
It was this failure which generated the gold standard. The emergence 
of the gold standard was the ~nanifestation of a crushing defeat of the 
governments and their cherished doctrines. 

In the seventeenth century the rates at which the English govern- 
ment tariffed the coins overvalued the guinea with regard to silver 
and thus made the siIver coins disappear. Only those silver coins which 
were much worn by usage or in any other way defaced or reduced in 
n.eight remained in current use; it did not pay to export and to sell 
then1 on the 1)ullion market. Thus England got the gold standard 
against the intention of its government. Only much later the laws 
made the de fncto gold standard a de jrwe standard. The government 
abandoned further fruitless attempts to pump silvcr standard coins 
into the market and minted silver only as subsidiary coins with a 
limited legal tcnclcr power. These subsidiary coins were not money, 
hut money-substitutes. Their exchange value depended not on their 
silver content, but on the fact that they could be exchanged at every 
instant, without dclay and without cos;, at thcir full face value against 
gold. They were dc facto silvcr printed notes, claims against a definite 
amount of gold. 

Later in the course of the nineteenth century the double standard 
resulted in a similar way in France and in the other countries of the 
1,atin iMonctary Union in the emergence of de facto gold monometal- 
I ism. When the drop in the price of silver in the latcr 'seventies would 
autornaticalIy have effected the replacement of the de facto gold 
standard by the de facto silver standard, these governments suspended 
the coinage of silver in ordcr to preserve the gold standard. In the 
United States the price structure on the bullion market had already, 
before the outbreak of the Civil War, transformed rhe legal bimetal- 
lism into de facto gold monometallism. After the greengack period 
there ensued a struggle between the friends of the gold standard on the 
one hand and those of silver on the other hand. The result was a 
victory for the gold standard. Once the economically most advanced 
nations had adopted the gold standard, all other nations followed suit. 
After the grcat inflationary adventures of the first World War most 
countries hastened to return to the gold standard or the gold ex- 
change standard. 

The gold standard was the world standard of the age of capitalism, 
increasing welfare, liberty, and democracy, both political and eco- 


47O Human Action 
nomic. In the eyes of the free tradcrs its main eminence was precisely 
the fact that it was an international standard as rcquired by inter- 
national trade and the transactions of the international money and 
capital market." It was the medium of exchange by means of which 
Western industrialism and Western capital had borne Western civ- 
ilization into the remotest parts of the earth's surface, everywhere 
destroying the fetters of age-old prejudices and superstitions, sowing 
the seeds of new life and new well-being, frecing minds and souls, 
and creating riches unheard of before. It accompanied the triumphal 
unprecedented progress of Western liberalism rcady to unite all 
nations into a community of free nations peacefully cooperating 
with one another. 
It is easy to understand why people viewed the gold standard as the 
symbol of this greatest and most bencficial of all historical changes. 
1111 those intent upon sabotaging the evolution toward welfare, peace, 
frccdom, and democracy loathed the gold standard, and not only on 
account of its cconornic significance. In their eyes the gold standard 
was the labarum, the symbol, of all those doctrines and policies they 
wanted to destroy. In the struggle against the gold standard much 
more was at stake than commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. 
The nationalists arc fighting the gold standard because they want 
to sever their countries from the world market and to establish 
national autarky as far as possible. Intervcntionist governmcnts and 
pressure groups are fighting the gold standard because they consider 
it the most scrious obstacle to their endeavors to manipulate prices and 
wage rates. But the most fanatical attacks against gold are made by 
those intent upon crcdit expansion. With them credit expansion is 
the panacea for all economic ills. It could lower or even entirely 
abolish interest rates, raise wages and prices for the benefit of all 
except the parasitic capitalists and the exploiting employers, free the 
state from the necessity of balancing its budget-in short, make all 
decent people prosperous and happy. Only the gold standard, that 
deviiifh contrivance of the wicked and stupid "orthodox" economists, 
prevents mankind from attaining everlasting prosperity. 
The gold standard is certainly not a perfect or ideal standard. There 
is no such thing as perfection in human things. But nobody is in a 
position to tell us how something more satisfactory couId be put in 
place of the gold standard. The purchasing power of gold is not 
stable. Rut the very notions of stability and unchangeability of pur- 
chasing power are absurd. In a living and changing world there can-

pp. 22 ff.

not be any such thing as stability of purchasing power. In the im- 
aginary construction of an evenly rotating economy thcre is no 
room left for a medium of exchange. It is an essential feature of 
money that its purchasing pourer is changing. In fact, the adversaries 
of the gold standard do not want to make money's purchasing power 
stable. They want rather to give to the governments the power to 
manipulate purchasing power without being hindered by an "ex-
ternal" factor, namely, the money relation of the gold standard. 

The main objection raised against the gold standard is that it makes 
operative in the determination of prices a factor which no govern- 
ment can control-the vicissitudes of gold production. Thus an 
"external" or "automatic" force restrains a national government's 
power to make its subjects as prosperous as it would like to make 
them. The international capitalists dictate and the nation's sovereignty 
becomes a sham. 

However, the futility of interventionist policies has nothing at 
all to do with monetary matters. It will be shown later why all isolated 
measures of government interference with market phenomena must 
fail to attain the ends sought. If the interventionist government wants 
to remedy the shortcomings of its first interferences by going further 
and further, it finally converts its country's economic system into 
socialism of the German pattern. Then it abolishes the domestic mar- 
ket altogether, and with it money and all monetary problems, even 
though it may retain some of the terms and labels of the market 
economy.30 In both cases it is not the gold standard that frustrates the 
good intentions of the benevolent authority. 

The significance of the fact that the gold standard makes the in- 
crease in the supply of gold depend upon the profitability of pro- 
ducing gold is, of course, that it limits the govcrnment7s power to 
resort to inflation. The gold standard makes the determination of 
money's purchasing power independent of the changing ambitions 
and doctrines of political parties and pressure groups. This is not 
a defect of the goid standard; it is its main exceiience. Every method 
of manipulating purchasing power is by necessity arbitrary. All 
methods recommended for the discovery of an allegedly objective 
and "scientific" yardstick for monetary manipulation are based on 
the illusion that changes in purchasing power can be "measured." 
The goId standard removes the determination of cash-induced changes 
in purchasing power from the political arena. Its general acceptance 
requires the acknowledgment of the truth that one cannot make a11 
people richer by printing money. The abhorrence of the gold standard 

30. Cf. below, Chapters XXVII-XXXI. 

Human Action 

is inspired by the superstition that omnipotent governments can create 
wealth out of little scraps of paper. 

It has been asserted that the gold standard too is a manipulated 
standard. The governments may influence the height of gold's pur- 
chasing power either by credi; expansion, even if it is kept within 
the limits drawn by considerations of preserving the redeemability 
of the money-substitutes, or indirectly by furthering measures which 
induce people to restrict the size of their cash holdings. This is true. 
It cannot be denied that the rise in commodity prices which occurred 
between I 896 and 1914was to a great extent pEovolted by such govern- 
ment policies. But the main thing is that the gold standard keeps all 
such endeavors toward lowering money's purchasing power within 
narrow limits. The inflationists are fighting the gold standard pre- 
cisely because thev consider these limits a serious obstacle to the 
realization of their plans. 

What the expansionists call the defects of the gold standard are 
indeed its very eminence and uscfulness. It checks large-scale in- 
flationary ventures on the part of governments. The gold standard 
did not fail. The governments were eager to destroy it, because 
they were committed to the fallacies that credit expansion is an 
appropriate means of lowering the rate of interest and of "improving" 
the baIance of trade. 

No government is, however, powerful enough to abolish the gold 
standard. Gold is the money of international trade and of the super- 
national economic community of ~nankind. It cannot be affected by 
measures of governments whose sovereignty is limited to definite 
countries. As long as a country is not economically self-sufficient 
in the strict sense of the term, as long as there are still some loopholes 
left in the walls by which nationalistic governments try to isolatc 
their countries from the rest of the world, gold is still used as money. 
It does not matter that governments confiscate the gold coins aGd 
bullion they can seize and punish those holding gold as felons. The 
language of biiarerai clearing agreements by means of which govern- 
ments are intent upon eliminating gold from international trade, 
avoids any reference to gold. But the turnovers performed on the 
ground of those agreements are calculated on gold prices. He who 
buys or sells on a foreign market calculates the advantages and dis- 
advantages of such transactions in gold. In spite of the fact that a 
country has severed its local currency from any link with gold, its 
domestic structure of prices remains closely connected with gold 
and the gold prices of the world market. If a government wants to 
sever its domestic price structure from that of the world market, it 


Indirect Exchange 473 

must resort to other measures, such as prohibitive import and export 
duties and embargoes. Nationalization of foreign trade, whether 
effected openly or directly by foreign exchange control, does not 
eliminate gold. The governments qua tradcrs are trading by the usc 
of gold as a medium of exchange. 

The struggle against gold which is one of the main concerns of 
all contemporary governments must not be looked upon as an isolated 
phenomenon. It is but one item in the gigantic process of destruction 
which is the mark of our time. People fight the gold standard because 
they want to substitute national autarky for free trade, war for 
peace, totalitarian government omnipotence for liberty. 

It may happcn one day that technology will discover a method 
of enlarging the supply if gold at such a low cost that gold will be- 
come useless for the monetary service. Then people will have to 
replace the gold standard by another standard. It is futile to bother 
today about the way in which this problem will be solved. We do not 
know anything about thc conditions under which the decision will 
have to be made. 

International Monetary Cooperation 

The international gold standard works without any action on the part of 
governments. It is effective real cooperation of all members of the world- 
embracing market economy. There is no need for any government to in- 
terfere in order to make the gold standard work as an international stand- 
ard. 

What governments call international monetary cooperation is concerted 
action for the sake of credit expansion. They have learned that credit ex- 
pansion, when limited to one country only, results in an external drain. 
They believe that it is only the extcrnal drain that frustrates their plans of 
lowering the rate of interest and thus of creating an everlasting boom. If 
all governments were to cooperate in thcir expansionist policies, they think, 
they could remove this obstacle. What is required is an international bank 

. .

people in all countries. 

There is no need to stress again here the point that what makes it impos- 

sible to lower the ratc of interest by means of credit expansion is not merely 

the external drain. This fundamental issue is dealt with exhaustively in 

other chapters and sections of this book.31 

But there is another important question to bc raised. 

Let us assume that there exists an international bank issuing fiduciary 

media the clientele of which is the world's whoIc population. It does not 

matter whcther these money-substitutes go directly into the cash holdings 

31. Cf. above, pp. 438-439, and below, pp. 547-583, 

Human Action 

of the individuals and firms, or are only kept by the various nations' central 
banks as reserves against their issuance of national money-substitutes. The 
deciding point is that there is a uniform world currency. The national 
banknotes and checkbook money are redeemable in money-substitutes 
issued by the international bank. The necessity of keeping its national eur- 
rency at par with the international currency limits the power of every 
nation's central banking system to expand credit. But the world bank is 
restrained only by those factors which limit credit expansion on the part 
of a single bank operating in an isolated economic system or in the whole 
world. 

We may as well assume that the international bank is not a bank issuing 
money-substitutes a part of which are fiduciary media, but a world 
authority issuing international fiat money. Gold has been entirely de- 
monetized. The only money in use is that created by the international 
authority. The international authority is free to increase the quantity of 
this money provided it does not go so far as to bring about the crack-up 
boom and the breakdown of the currency. 

Thcn the ideal of the Keynesians is realized. There is an institution 
operating which can exercise an "expansionist prcssure on world trade." 
It is free to pour a horn of plenty over the world. 

However, the champions of such plans have neglected a fundamental 
problem, namely, that of the distribution of the additional quantities of 
this credit money or of this paper money. 

Let us assume that the international authority increases the amount of its 
issuance by a definite sum, all of which goes to one country, Ruritania. The 
final result of this inflationary action will be a rise in prices of commodities 
and services all over the world. But while this process is going on, the con- 
ditions of the citizens of various countries are affected in a different way. 
The Ruritanians are the first group blessed by the additional manna. They 
have more money in their pockets while the rest of the world's inhabitants 
have not yet got a share of the new money. They can bid higher prices, 
while the others cannot. Therefore the Ruritanians withdraw more goods 
from the world market than they did before. The non-Ruritanians are 
forced to restrict their consumption because they cannot compete with 
the higher prices paid by the Ruritanians. While the process of adjusting 
prices to the altered money relation is still in progress, the Ruritanians are 
in an advantageous position against the non-Ruritanians. When the process 
finally comes to an end, the Ruritanians have been enriched at the expense 
of the non-Ruritanians. 

The main problem in such expansionist ventures is the proportion ac- 
cording to which the additional money is to be allotted to the various 
nations. Each nation will be eager to advocate a mode of distribution which 
will give it the greatest possible share in the additional currency. The in- 
dustrially backward nations of the East will, for instance, probably recom- 
mend equal distribution per capita of population, a mode which would 
obviously favor them at the expenw of the industrially advanced nations. 


Indirect Exchange 475 

Whatever mode may be adopted, all nations would be dissatisfied and 
would complain of unfair treatment. Serious conflicts would ensue and 
would disrupt the whole scheme. 

It wouId be irrelevant to object that this problem did not play an impor- 
tant role in the negotiations which preceded the establishment of the Inter- 
nationaI Monetary Fund and that it was easy to reach an agreement con- 
cerning the use of the Fund's resources. The Bretton Woods Conference 
was held under very particular circumstances. Most of the participating 
nations were at that time entirely dependent on the benevolence of the 
United States. They would have been doomed if the United States had 
stopped fighting for their freedom and aiding them materially by lend- 
lease. The government of the United States, on the other hand, looked 
upon the monetary agreement as a scheme for a disguised continuation of 
lend-lease after the cessation of hostilities. The United States was ready to 
give and the other participants-especially those of the European countries, 
most of them at that time still entirely occupied by the German armies, and 
those of the Asiatic countries-were ready to take whatever was offered to 
them. The problems involved will become discernible as soon as the war- 
time attitude in the United States toward financial and trade matters is 
replaced by a more realistic mentality. 


XVIII. ACTION IN THE PASSING OF TIME 
I. Perspective in the Valuation of Time Periods 
CTING man distinguishes the time before satisfaction of a want is Aattained and the time for which the satisfaction continues. 

Action always aims at the removal of future uneasiness, be it only 
the future of the impending instant. Between the setting in of action 
and the attainment of the end sought there always elapses a fraction 
of time, viz., the maturing time in which the seed sown by the action 
grows to maturity. The mast obvious example is provided by agricul- 
ture. Between the tilling of the soil and the ripening of the fruit there 
passes a considerable period of time. Another example is the improve- 
ment of the quality of wine by aging. In some cases, however, the 
maturing time is so short that ordinary speech may assert that the 
success appears instantly. 

As far as action requires the employment of labor, it is concerned 
with the working time. The performance of every kind of labor 
absorbs time. In some cases the working time is so short that people 
say the performance requires no time at all. 

Only in rare cases does a simple, indivisible and nonrepeated act 
suffice to attain the end aimed at. As a rule what separates the actor 
from the goal of his endeavors is more than one step only. He must 
make many steps. And every further step to be added to those pre- 
viously made raises anew the question whether or not hc should 
continue marching toward the goal once chosen. Most goals are so 
far away that only determined persistence leads to them. Persever-

&CLLC~ 

order to succeed. The total expenditure of time required, i.e., work-

ing time plus maturing time, may be called the period of production. 

The period of production is long in some cases and short in other 

cases. It is sometimes so short that it can be entirely negIectcd in 

practice. 

The increment in want-satisfaction which the attainment of the 

end brings about is temporally limited. The result produced extends 

services only over a period of time which we may call the duration 

of serviceableness. The duration of serviceableness is shorter with 


Action in the Passing of Time 

some products and longer with other goods which are commonly 
called durable goods. Hence acting man must always take into ac- 
count the period of production and the duration of serviceableness 
of the product. In estimating the disutility of a project considered he 
is not only concerned with the expenditure of material factors and 
Iabor required, but also with the period of production. In estimating 
the utility of the expected product he is concerned with the duration 
of its serviceableness. Of course, the more durable a product is, the 
greater is the amount of services it renders. But if these services are 
not cumulatively available on the same date, but extended piecemeal 
over a certain period of time, the time element, as will be shown, 
pIays a particular role in their evaluation. It makes a difference 
whether n units of service are rendered on the same date or whether 
they are stretched over a period of n days in such a way that only 
one unit is available daily. 

It is important to realize that the period of production as well as 
the duration of serviceableness arc categories of human action and 
not concepts constructed by philosophers, economists, and historians 
as mental tools for their in;erpretation of events. They are essential 
elements present in every act of reasoning that precedes and directs 
action. It is necessary to stress this point because Bijhm-Bawerli, to 
whom economics owes the discovery of the role played by the period 
of production, failed to comprehend the difference. 

Acting man does not look at his condition with the eyes of a his- 
torian. He is not concerned with how the present situation originated. 
His only concern is to make the best use of the means available today 
for the best possible removal of future uneasiness. The past does not 
count for him. He has at his disposal a definite quantity of material 
factors of production. He does not ask whether these factors are 
nature-given or the product of production processes accomplished 
in the past. It does not matter for him how great a quantity of nature- 
given, i.e., original material factors of production and labor, was 
expended in rheir producrion and how much rime these processes of 
production have absorbed. He values the available means exclusively 
from the aspect of the services they can render him in his endeavors 
to make future conditions more satisfactory. The period of pro- 
duction and the duration of serviceableness are for him categories in 
planning future action, not concepts of academic retrospection and 
historical research. They play a role in so far as the actor has to 
choose between periods of production of different length and be- 
tween the production of more durable and less durable goods. 

Action is not concerned with thc future in general, but always 


Human Action 

with a definite and limited fraction of the future. This fraction is 
limited, on the one side, by the instant in which the action must take 
place. Where its other end lies depends on the actor's decision and 
choice. There are people who are concerned with only the impend- 
ing instant. There are other people whose provident care stretches 
far beyond the prospective length of their own life. We may call the 
fraction of future time for which the actor in a definite action wants 
to provide in some way and to some extent, the period of provision. 
In the same way in which acting man chooses among various kinds of 
want-satisfaction within the same fraction of future time, he chooses 
also between want-satisfaction in the nearer and in the remoter 
future. Every choice implies also a choice of a period of provision. 
In ~naking up his mind how to employ the various means available 
for the removal of uneasiness, man also determines implicitly the 
period of provision. In the market economy the demand of the con- 
sumers also determines the length of the period of provision. 

There are various methods available for a lengthening of the period 
of provision: 

I. The accumulation of larger stocks of consumers' goods destined 
for later consumption. 
2. The production of goods which are more durable. 
3. The production of goods req~~iring 
a longer period of produc- 
tion. 

4. The choice of methods of production consuming more time 
for the production of goods which could also be produced within 
a shorter period of production. 
The first two methods do not require any further comment. The 
third and the fourth methods must be scrutinized more closely. 

It is one of the fundamental data of human life and action that 
the shortest processes of production, i.e., those with the shortest 
period of production, do not remove felt uneasiness entirely. If all 
those goods which these shortest processes can provide are produced, 
unsatisfied wants remain and incentive to further action is stiii present. 
As acting man prefers those processes which, other things being 
equal, produce the products in the shortest tirne'l only such processes 
are left for further action which consume more time. People embark 
upon these more time-consuming processes because they value the 
increment in satisfaction expected more highly than the disadvantage 
of waiting longer for their fruits. Bohm-Bawerk speaks of the higher 
productivity of roundabout ways of production requiring more 
time. It is more appropriate to speak of the higher physical produc- 

I. Why man proceeds in this way, will be shown on the following pages. 

Action in the Passing of Tirne 

tivity of production processes requiring more time. The higher 
productivity of these processes does not always consist in the fact 
that they produce-with the same quantity of factors of production 
expended-a greater quantity of products. More often it consists in 
the fact that they produce products which could not be produced 
at all in shorter periods of production. These processes are not round- 
about processes. They are the shortest and quickest way to the goal 
chosen. If one wants to catch more fish, there is no other method 
available than the substitution of fishing with the aid of nets and canoes 
for fishing without the aid of this equipment. There is no better, 
shorter, and cheaper method for the production of aspirin known 
than that adopted by the chemical plants. If onc disregards error and 
ignorance, there cannot be any doubt about the highest productivity 
and expediency of the processes chosen. If people had not considered 
them the most direct processes, viz., those leading by the shortest way 
to the end sought, they would not have adopted them. 

The lengthening of the period of provision through the mere ac- 
cumulation of stocks of consumers' goods is the outcome of the desire 
to provide in advance for a longer period of time. The same is valid 
for the production of goods the durability of which is greater in 
proportion to the greater expenditure of factors of production re-
q~ired.~

But if temporally remoter goals are aimed at, Iengthening of 
the period of production is a necessary corollary of the venture. The 
end sought cannot be attained in a shorter period of production. 

The postponement of an act of consumption means that the individ- 
ual prefers the satisfaction which later consumption will provide 
to the satisfaction which immediate consumption could provide. The 
choice of a longer period of production means that the actor values 
the product of the process bearing fruit only at a later date more 
highly than the products which a process consuming less time could 
provide. In such deliberations and the resulting choices the period 
of production appears as waiting time. It was the great contribution 
of Jevons and Bohm-Bawerk to have shown the role played by taking 
account of waiting time. 

If acting men were not to pay heed to the length of the waiting 
time, they would never say that a goal is temporally so distant that one 
cannot consider aiming at it. Faced with the alternative of choosing 
between two processes of production which render different output 
with the same input, they would always prefer that process which 

z. If the lengthening of durability were not at least proportionate to the in- 
crement in expenditure needed, it would be more advantageous to increase the 
quantity of units of a shorter durability. 

Human Action 
renders the greater quantity of the same products or better products 
in the same quantity, even if this result could be attained onIy by 
lengthening the period of production. Increments in input which 
result in a more than proportionate increase in the products' duration 
of serviceableness would unconditionally be deemed advantageous. 
The fact that men do not act in this way evidences that they value 
fractions of time of the same length in a different way according as 
they are nearer or remoter from the instant of the actor's decision. 
Other things being equal, satisfaction in a nearer period of the future 
is preferred to satisfaction in a more distant period; disutility is seen 
in waiting. 
This fact is already implied in the statement stressed in the opening 
of this chapter that man distinguishes the time before satisfaction is 
attained and the time for the duration of which there is satisfaction. 
If any role at all is played by the time element in human life, there 
cannot be any question of equal valuation of nearer and remoter 
periods of the same length. Such an equal valuation would mean that 
people do not care whether success is attained sooner or later. It 
would be tantamount to a complete elimination of the time element 
from the process of valuation. 
The mere fact that goods with a longer duration of serviceableness 
are valued more highly than those with a shorter duration does not 
yet in itsclf imply a consideration of ti~ne. A roof that can protect 
a house against the weather during a period of ten years is more 
valuable than a roof which renders this service only for a period of 
five years. The quantity of service rendered is different in both cases. 
But the question which we have to deal with is whether or not an actor 
in malting his choices attaches to a service to be available in a later 
period of the future the same value he attaches to a service available 
at an earlier period. 

2. Time Preference as an EssentiaI Requisite of Action 
The answer to this question is that acting man does not appraise 
time periods merely with regard to their dimension. His choices re- 
garding the removal of future uneasiness are directed by the cate- 
gories sooner and later. Time for man is not a homogeneous substance 
of which only length counts. It is not a more or a less in dimension. 
It is an irreversible flux the fractions of which appear in different 
perspective according to whether they are nearer to or remoter from 
the instant of valuation and decision. Satisfaction of a want in the 
nearer future is, other things being equal, preferred to that in the 


Action in the Pnssin.g of Time 481 

farther distant future. Present goods are more valuable than future 
goods. 

Time prefercnce is a categorial requisite of human action. No mode 
of action can be thought of in which satisfaction within a nearer 
period of the future is not-other things being equal-preferred 
to that in a later period. The very act of gratifying a desire implies 
that gratification at the present instant is preferred to that at a later 
instant. He who consumcs a nonperishable good instead of postponing 
consumption for an indefinite later moment thereby revcals a higher 
valuation of present satisfaction as compared with later satisfaction. 
If he were not to prefer satisfaction in a nearer period of the future 
to that in a remoter period, he would never consume and so satisfy 
wants. He would always accumulate, he would never consume and 
enjoy. He wouId not consume today, but he would not consume to- 
morrow either, as the morrow would confront him with the same 
alternative. 

Not only the first step toward want-satisfaction, but also any 
further step is guided by time prefercnce. Once the desire a: to which 
the scale of values assigns the rank I is satisfied, one must choose be- 
tween the desire b to which the rank 2 is assigned and c that desire 
of tomorrow to which-in the absence of time preference-the rank 
I would have been assigned. If b is preferred to c, the choice clearly 
involves time preference. Purposive striving after want-satisfaction 
must needs be guided by a preference for satisfaction in the nearer 
future over that in a remoter future. 

The conditions under which modern man of the capitalist West 
must act are different from those under which his primitive ancestors 
lived and acted. As a result of the providential care of our forebears 
we have at our disposal an ample stock of intermediate products 
(capital goods or produced factors of production) and of consumers' 
goods. Our activities arc designed for a longer period of provision be- 
cause we are the lucky heirs of a past which has lengthened, step by 
step, the period of provision and has bequeathed to us the meam to 
expand the waiting period. In acting we are concerned with longcr 
periods and are aiming at an even satisfaction in all parts of the 
period chosen as the period of provision. We are in a position to relv 
upon a continuing influx of consun~ers' goods and have at our dis- 
posal not only stocks of goods ready for consumption but also 
stocks of pro&ccrs' goods out of which our continuous efforts again 
and again make new consumers' goods mature. In our dealing with 
this increasing "stream of income," says the superficial observer, 
there is no heed paid to any considerations related to a different 


Human Action 

valuation of present and of future goods. We synchronize, he asserts, 
and thus the time element loses any importance for the conduct of 
affairs. It is, therefore, pointless, he continues, in the interpretation 
of modern conditions to resort to time preference. 

The fundamental error involved in this popular objection is caused, 
like so many other errors, by a lamentable misapprehension of the 
imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy. In the frame 
of this imaginary construction no change occurs; there prevails an 
unvarying course of all affairs. In the evenly rotating economy con- 
sequently nothing is altered in the allocation of goods for the satis- 
faction of wants in nearer and in remoter periods of the future. hTo 
one pIans any change because-according to our assumptions-the 
prevailing allocation best serves him and because he does not believe 
that any possible rearrangement could improve his condition. No 
one wants to increase his consumption in a nearer period of the fu- 
ture at the expense of his consumption in a more distant period or 
vice versa because the existing mode of alIocation pleases him better 
than any other thinkable and feasible mode. 

The praxeological distinction between capital and income is a 
category of thought based on a different valuation of want-satisfac- 
tion in various periods of the future. In the imaginary construction 
of the evenly rotating economy it is implied that the whole income 
but not more than the income is consumed and that therefore the 
capital remains unchanged. An equilibrium is reached in the alloca- 
tion of goods for want-satisfaction in different periods of the future. 
It is permissible to describe this state of affairs by asserting that no- 
body wants to consume tomorrow's income today. We have precisely 
designed the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy 
in such a way as to make it fit just this condition. But it is necessary 
to realize that we can assert with the same apodictic assurance that, 
in the evenly rotating economy, nobody wants to have more of any 
commodity than he really has. These statements arc true with regard 
to the evenly rotating economy because they are implied in our defini- 
tion of this imaginary construction. They are nonsensical when as- 
serted with regard to a changing economy which alone is real. As soon 
as a change in the data occurs, the individuals are faced anew with the 
necessity of choosing both between various modes of want-satisfac- 
tion in the same period and between want-satisfaction in different 
periods. An increment can be either employed for immediate con- 
sumption or invested for further production. No matter how the 
actors employ it, their choice must needs be the result of a weighing 
of the advantages expected from want-satisfaction in different periods 


Action in the Passing of Time 

of the future. In the world of reality, in the living and changing uni- 
verse, each individual in each of his actions is forced to choose be- 
tween satisfaction in various periods of time. Some people consume 
all that they earn, others consume a part of their capital, others save 
a part of their income. 

Those contesting the universal validity of time preference fail to 
explain why a man does not always invest a sum of ~oo dollars avail- 
able today, although these ~oo dollars would incrcase to 104 dollars 
within a year's time. It is obvious that chis man in consuming this 
sum today is determined by a judgment of value which values loo 
present dollars higher than I 04 dollars available a year later. But even 
in case he chooses to invest these loo dollars, the meaning is not that 
he prefers satisfaction in a later period to that of today. It means that 
he values roo dollars today less than 104 dollars a year latcr. Every 
penny spent today is. precisely under the conditions of a capitalist 
economy in which institutions make it possible to invest even the 
smallest sums, a proof of the higher valuation of present satisfaction 
as compared with later satisfaction. 

The theorem of time preference must be demonstrated in a double 
way. First for the case of plain saving in which people must choose 
between the immediate consumption of a quantity of goods and the 
later consumption of the same quantity. Second for the case of capi- 
talist saving in which the choice is to be made between the immediate 
consumption of a quantity of goods and the later consumption either 
of a greater quantity or of goods which are fit to provide a satisfaction 
which-except for thc difference in time-is valued more highly. The 
proof has been given for both cases. No other case is thinkable. 

It is possiblc to search for a psychological understanding of the 

problem of time preference. Impatience and the pains caused by 

waiting are certainly psychological phenomena. One may approach 

their clucidation by referring to the temporal limitations of human 

life, to the individual's coming into existence, his growth and matur- 

ing, and his inevitable decay and passing away. There is in the course 

of man's life a right moment for everything as well as a too early and 

a too late. However, the praxeological problem is in no way related 

to psychological issues. We must conceive, not merely understand. 

We must conceive that a man who docs not prefer satisfaction within 

a nearer period of the future to that in a rcmotcr period would never 

achieve consumption and enjoyment at all. 

Neither must the praxeological problem be confused with the 

physiological. He who wants to live to see the later day, must first 

of all care for the preservation of his life in the intermediate period. 


Human Action 

Survival and appeasement of vital needs are thus requirements for the 
satisfaction of any wants in the remoter future. This makes us under- 
stand why in all those situations in which bare life in the strict sense 
of the term is at stake satisfaction in the nearer future is preferred to 
that in later periods. But we are dealing with action as such, not with 
the motives directing its course. In the same way in which as econ-
omists we do not ask why albumin, carbohydrates, and fat are de- 
manded by man, we do not inquire why the satisfaction of vital needs 
appears imperative and does not brook any delay. We must conceive 
that consumption and enjoyment of any kind presuppose a preference 
for present satisfaction to later satisfaction. The ltnowledge provided 
by this insight far exceeds the orbit for which the physiological facts 
concerned provide explanation. It refers to every kind of want-satis- 
faction, not only to the satisfaction of the vital necessities of mere 

survival. 

It is important to stress this point because the term "supply of 

subsistence, availabIe for advances of subsistence," as used by Bijhm- 

Bawerk, can easily be misinterpreted. It is certainly one of the tasks 

of this stock to provide the means for a satisfaction of the bare neces- 

sities of life and thus to secure survival. But besides it must be large 

enough to satisfy, btyond the requirements of necessary maintenance 

for the waiting time, all those wants and desires which-apart from 

mere survival-are considered more urgent than the harvesting of 

the physically more abundant fruits of production processes con- 

suming more time. 

Biihm-Bawerk declared that every lengthening of the period of 

production depends on the condition that "a sufficient quantity of 

present goods is available to make it possible to overbridge the 

lengthened average interval between the starting of preparatory work 

and the harvesting of its product." The expression "sufficient quan- 

tity" needs elucidation. It does not mean a quantity sufficient for 

necessary sustenance. The quantity in question must be large enough 

to secure the sarisfacrion of aii rhose wants rhe satisfacrion of which 

during the waiting time is considered more urgent than the advantages 

which a still greater lengthening of the period of production would 

provide. If the quantity in question were smaller, a shortening of the 

period of production would appear advantageous; the increase in the 

quantity of products or the improvement of their quality to be ex- 

pected-from the preservation of the longer period of production 

would no longer be considered a sufficient remuneration for the

Action in the Passing of Time 

restriction of consumption enjoined during the waiting time. Whether 
or not the supply of subsistence is sufficient, does not depend on any 
physiological or other facts opcn to objective determination by the 
methods of technology and physiology. The metaphorical term 
"overbridge," suggesting a body of water the breadth of which poses 
to the bridge builder an objectively determined task, is misleading. 
The quantity in question is valued by men, and their subjective judg- 
ments decide whether or not it is sufficient. 

Even in a hypothetical world in which nature provides every man 
with the means for the preservation of biological survival (in the 
strict sense of the term), in which the most important foodstuffs 
arc not scarce and action is not concerned with the provision for bare 
life, the phenomenon of time preference would be present and direct 
a11 acti0ns.l 

Observations on the Evolution of the Time-Preference Theory 

It seems plausible to assume that the mere fact that interest is graduated 
in reference to periods of time should have directed the attention of the 
economists, intent upon developing a theory of interest, upon the role 
played by time. However, the classical economists were prevented by their 
faulty theory of value and their niisconstruction of the cost concept from 
recognizing the importance of the time element. 

Economics owes the time-preference theory to William Stanley Jevons 
and its elaboration, most of all, to Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk. Biihnl-Bawerk 
was the first to formulate correctly the problem to be solved, the first to 
unmask the fallacies implied in the productivity theories and the first to 
stress the role played by the period of production. But he did not entirely 
succeed in avoiding the pitfalIs in the elucidation of the interest problem. 
His demonstration of the universal validity of time preference is inade- 
quate because it is based on psychological considerations. However, psy- 
zhology can never demonstrate the validity of a praxeological theorem. It 
may show that some people or many people let themselves be influenced 
by certain motives. It can never make evident that all human action is 
necessarily dominated by a definite catcgorial clement which, without 
any exception, is operative in every instance of a~tion.~ 

The second shortcoming of Bohm-Bawerk's reasoning was his miscon- 

struction of the concept of the period of production. He was not fully 

aware of the fact that the period of production is a praxeological category 

4. Time preference is not specifically human. It is an inherent feature of the 
behavior of all living beings. The distinction of man consists in the very fact that 
with him time preference is not inexorable and the lengthening of the period of 
provision not merely instinctive as with certain animals that store food, but the 
result of a process of valuation. 
5. For a detailed critical analysis of this part of Bohm-Bawerk's reasoning the 
reader is referred to Mises, Nationalokonomie, pp. 439-443. 

Human Action 

and that the role it plays in action consists entirely in the choices acting 

man makes between periods of production of different length. The length 

of time expended in the past for the production of capital goods available 

today does not count at all. These capital goods are valued only with re- 

gard to their usefulness for future want-satisfaction. The "average period 

of production" is an empty concept. What determines action is the fact 

that in choosing among various ways which can remove future uneasiness 

the length of the waiting time in each case is a necessary element. 

It was an outcome of these two errors that Bohm-Bawerk in the elabora- 

tion of his theory did not entirely avoid the productivity approach which 

he himself had so brilliantly refuted in his critical history of the doctrines 

of capital and interest. 

These observations do not detract at all from the imperishable merits of 

Bohm-Bawerk's contributions. It was on the foundation laid by him that 

later economists-foremost among them Knut Wicksell, Frank Albert 

Fetter and Irving Fisher-were successful in perfecting the time-preference 

theory. 

It is customary to express the essence of the time-preference theory by 
saying that there prevails a preference for present over future goods. In 
dealing with this mode of expression some economists have been pu~zled 
by the fact that in some cases present uses are worth less than future uses. 
However, the problem raised by these apparent exceptions is caused merely 
by an misapprehension of the true state of affairs. 

There are enjoyments which cannot be had at the same time. A man can- 
not on the same evening attend performances of Carmen and of liamlet. 
In buying a ticket he must choose between the two performances. If tickets 
to both theaters for the same evening are presented to hi~n as a gift, he must 
likewise choose. He may think with regard to the ticket which he refuses: 
"1 don't care for it just now," or "If only it had been later." However, 
this does not mean that he prefers future goods to present goods. He does 
not have to choose between future goods and present goods. He must 
choose between two enjoyments both of which he cannot have together. 
This is the dilemma in every instance of choosing. In the present state of 
his affairs he may prefer Hamlet to Carmen. The different conditions of a 
later date may possibly result in another decision. 

The second seeming exception is presented by the case of pcrishable 
goods. They may be available in abundance in one season of the year and 
may be scarce in other seasons. However, the difference between ice in 
winter and ice in summer is not that between a present good and a future 
good. It is the difference between a good that loses its specific usefulness 
even if not consumed and another good which requires a different process 
of production. Ice available in winter can only be used in summer when 
subjected to a special process of conservation. It is, in respect to ice utiliz- 
able in summer, at best one of the complementary factors required for 
production. It is impossible to increase the quantity of ice available in sum- 

6. Cf. F. A.Fetter, Economic Principles (New York, rgzj), I, 239. 

Action in the Passing of Time 

mer simply by restricting the consumption of ice in winter. The two things 
are for all practical purposes different commodities. 

The case of the miser does not contradict the universal validity of time 
preference. The miser too, in spending some of his means for a scanty live- 
lihood, prefers some amount of satisfaction in the nearer future to that in 
the remoter future. Extreme instances in which the miser denies himself 
even the indispensable minimum of food represent a pathological withering 
away of vital energy, as is the case with the man who abstains from eating 
out of fear of morbific germs, the man who commits suicide rather than 
mect a dangerous situation, and the man who cannot sleep because he is 
afraid of undetcrmined accide~ts which could befall him w-hile asleep. 

3. Capital Goods 
As soon as those present wants are sated the satisfaction of which 
is considered more urgent than any provision for the morrow, 
people begin to save a part of the available supply of consumers' goods 
for later use. This postponement of consumption makes it possible 
to direct action toward temporally remoter ends. It is now feasible 
to aim at goals which could not be thought of before on account of 
the length of the period of production required. It is furthermore 
fea5ibIe to choose methods of production in which the output of 
products is greater per unit of input than in other methods requiring 
a shorter period of production. The sine qua non of any lengthening 
of the processes of production adopted is saving, i.e., an excess of 
current production over current consumption. Saving is the first 
step on the way toward irnprovement of material well-being and 
toward every further progress on this way. 

The postponement of consumption and the accumulation of stocks 
of consumers' goods destined for later consumption would be prac- 
ticed even in the absence of the stimulus offered by the technological 
superiority of processes with a longer period of production. The 
higher productivity of such processes consuming more time strength- 
ens considerably the propensity to save. The sacrifice made by re-
stricting consumption in nearer periods of the future is henceforth 
not only counrcrbalanced by the expectation of consuming the saved 
goods in remoter periods; it also opens the way to a more ample sup- 
ply in the remoter future and to the attainment of goods which could 
nit be procured at all without this sacrifice. If acting man, other condi- 
tions being equal, were not to prefer, w-ithout exception, consumption 
in the nearer future to that in the remoter future, he would always 
save, ncver consume. What restricts the amount of saving and in- 
vestment is time preference. 


Human Action 

People eager to cmbark upon processes with a longer period of 
production must first accumulate, by means of saving, that quantity 
of consumers' goods which is needed to satisfy, during the waitink 
time, all those wants the satisfaction of which they considcr more 
urgcnt than thc increment in well-being expccted from the more 
time-consuming process. Accun~ulation of capital begins with the 
formation of stocks of consumers' goods thc consumption of which 
is postponed for latcr days. If thesc surpluses are rnerely stored and 
kept for latcr consumption, they are simply wealth or, more precisely, 
a reserve for rainy days and emergencies. 'lhey remain outside the 
orbit of production. They become integrated-economically, not 
physically-into production activities only when crnployed as means 
of subsistence of workcrs engagcd in more time-consuming processes. 
If expended in this way, they are physically consumed. But economi- 
cally they do not disappear. They are replaced first by the intcr- 
~nediary products of a process with a longer period oi production 
and then latcr by the consumers' goods which arc the final product 
of these processes. 

All these ventures and processes arc intcllcctually controlled by 
capital accounting, the acme of cconornic calculation in monetary 
terms. Without the aid of monetary calculation men could not cvcn 
Iearn whether-apart from the length of the period of production-a 
definite proccss pron~ises a higher productivity than another. The 
cxpcnditures required by various processes cannot be weighed against 
one another without the aid of monetary terms. Capital accounting 
starts with thc market prices of the capital goods availabIe for further 
production, the sun1 of which it calls capital. It records cvcry ex- 
penditure from this fund and the price of all incoming items induced 
by such expenditure. It establishcs finally the uItimatc outcome of all 
these transformations in the composition of the capital and thereby 
the success or the failure of thc whole process. It shows not only the 
final result; it mirrors also every one of its intermediary stages. It 
produces intcrinl balances for e;ery day such a balance hay he re- 
quired and statements of profit and loss for every part or stage of the 
proccss. It is the indispcnsabIe compass of production in the mar- 
ket economy. 

In the market economy production is a continuous, never-ending 
pursuit split up into an immense variety of partiaI proccsscs. Innumer- 
able proccsscs of production with different periods of production are 
in progress sitnultaneously. Thcy cornplenlent one another and at 
the same time are in rivalry with one another in competing for scarce 
factors of production. Continuously either new capital is accumulated 


Action in the I'nssing of Time 

by saving or previously accumulated capital is eaten up by over- 
consumption. production is distributed among numerous individual 
plants, farms, workshops, and enterprises each of which serves only 
limited purposes. The intermediary products or capital goods, the 
produced factors of further production, change hands in the course 
of evcnts; they pass from one plant to another until finally the con- 
sumers' goods reach those who use and enjoy them. The social 
process of ~roduction never stops. At each instant numberless proc- 
esses are in progress some of which arc nearer to, some remoter from, 
the achievement of their special tasks. 

Every single performance in this ceaseIess pursuit of wealth pro- 
duction is based upon the saving and the preparatory work of earlier 
generations. We are the lucky heirs of our fathers and forefathers 
whose saving has accumulated the capital goods with the aid of 
which we are working today. We favorite children of the age of 
electricity stiIl derive advantagc from the original saving of the 
primitive fishermen who, in producing the first nets and canoes, de- 
voted a part of their working time to provision for a remoter future. 
If the sons of these legendary fishermen had worn out these inter- 
mediary products-nets and canoes-without replacing them by new 
ones, they would have consumed capital and the process of saving 
and capital accumulation would have had to start afresh. We are 
better off than earlier generations because we are equipped with the 
capital goods they have accumulated for us.7 

The businessman, thc acting man, is entirely absorbed in one task 
only: to take best advantage of all the means availablc for the im- 
provement of future conditions. He does not look at the present 
state of affairs with the aim of analyzing and comprehending it. In 
cIassifying the means for further iroduction and appraising their 
importance he adopts superficial rules of thumb. He distinguishes 
three classes of factors of production: the nature-given material 
factors, the human factor-labor, and capital goods-the intermediary 
factors produced in the past. Ile does not analyze the nature of the 
capital goods. They are in his cyes means of increasing the produc- 
tivity of labor. QU~ 

nai'vely he ascrilm to them productive power 
of their own. He does not trace their instrumentality bad- to nature 
and labor. He does not ask how they came into existence. They count 
only as far as they may contribute to the success of his efforts. 

This mode of reasoning is all right for the businessman. But it was 

7. These considerations explode the objections raised against the time-pref- 
erence cheory by Frank H. Knight in his arriclc, "Capital, 'Time and the Interest 
Hate," Economics, n.s., I, 257-286. 

Human Action 
a serious mistake for the economists to agree with the businessman's 
superficial view. They erred in classifying "capital" as an independent 
factor of production along with the nature-given material resources 
and labor. The capital goods-the factors of further production pro- 
duced in the past-are not an independent factor. They are the joint 
products of the cooperation of the two original factors-nature and 
labor-expended in the past. They have no productive power of 
their own. 
Neither is it correct to call the capital goods labor and nature 
stored up. They are rather labor, nature, and time stored up. The 
difference between production without the aid of capital goods and 
that assisted by the employment of capital goods consists in time. 
Capital goods are intermediary stations on the way leading from the 
very beginning of production to its final goal, the turning out of 
consumers' goods. He who produces with the aid of capital goods 
enjoys one great advantage over the man who starts without capital 
goods; he is nearer in time to the ultimate goal of his endeavors. 
There is no question of an aIleged productivity of capital goods. 
The difference between the price of a capital good, e.g., a machine, 
and the sum of the prices of the complementary original factors of 
production required for its reproduction is entirely due to the time 
difference. He who employs the machine is nearer the goal of produc- 
tion. The period of production is shorter for him than for a com-
petitor who must start from the beginning. In buying a machine he 
buys the original factors of production to be expended in its repro- 
duction plus time, i.e., the time by which his period of production is 
shortened. 
The value of time, i.e., time preference or the higher valuation of 
want-satisfaction in nearer periods of the future as against that in 
remoter periods, is an essential element in human action. It determines 
every choice and every action. There is no man for whom the differ- 
ence between sooner and later does not count. The time element is 
instrumental in the formation of all prices of all commodities and 
services. 

4. Period of Production, Waiting Time, and 
Period of Provision 
If one were to measure the length of the period of production spent 
in the fabrication of the various goods available now, one would 
have to trace back their history to the point at which the first ex- 
penditure of original factors of production took place. One would 


Action in the Passing of Time 

497 

have to establish when natural resources and labor were first em- 
ployed for processes which-besides contributing to the production 
of other goods-also contributed ultimately to the production of 
the good in question. The solution of this problem would require 
the solubiIity of the problem of physical imputation. It would be 
necessary to establish in quantitative terms to what extent tools, 
raw materials, and labor which directly or indirectly were used in 
the production of the good concerned contributed to the result. One 
would have to go back in these inquiries to the very origins of capital 
accunmlation by saving on the part of people who previously lived 
from band to mouth. It is not only practical difficulties which prevent 
such historical studies. The very insolubility of the problem of phys- 
ical imputation stops us at the first step of such ventures. 

Keither acting man himself nor economic theory needs a meas- 
urement of the time expended in the past for the production of goods 
available today. They would have no use for such data even if they 
kncw them. Acting man is faced with the problem of how to take 
bcst advantage of the available supply of goods. He makes his choices 
in employing each part of this supply in such a way as to satisfy 
the most urgent of the not yet satisfied wants. For the achievcment 
of this task he must know the length of the waiting time which sepa- 
rates him from the attainment of the various goals among which he has 
to choose. As has been pointed out and must be emphasized again, 
there is no need for him to look backward to the history of the 
various capital goods available. Acting man counts waiting time and 
the period of production always from today on. In the same way in 
which there is no need to know whether more or less labor and 
material factors of production have been expendcd in the production 
of the products available now, there is no need to know whether their 
production has absorbed more or less time. Things are valued ex-
clusively from the point of view of the services they can render for 
the satisfaction of future wants. The actual sacrifices made and the 
time absorbed in their production are beside the point. These things 
belong to the dead past. 

It is necessary to realize that all cconomic categories are related 

to human action and have nothing at a11 to do directly with the 

physical properties of things. Economics is not about goods and 

services; it is about human choice and action. The praxeological con- 

cept of time is not the concept of physics or biology. It refers to the 

sooner or thc later as operative in the actors' judgments of vaIue. The 

distinction between capital goods and consumers' goods is not a rigid 

distinction based on the physical and physiological properties of the 


Human Action 

goods concerned. It depends on the position of the actors and the 
choices they have to make. The same goods can be looked upon as 
capital goods and as consun~ers' goods. A supply of goods ready for 
immediate enjoyment is capital goods from the point of view of a 
man who looks upon it as a means for his own sustenance and that of 
hired worlrcrs during a waiting time. 

An increase in the quantity of capital goods available is a necessary 
condition for thc adoption of processes in which the period of 
production and therefore waiting time are longer. If one wants to 
attain ends which are temporally farther away, one must resort to 
a longer period of production bccause it is impossible to attain the 
end sought in a shorter period of production. If one wants to resort 
to methods of production with which the quantity of output is higher 
per unit of input expended, one must lengthen the period of produc- 
tion. For the processes with which output is smaller per unit of input 
have been chosen only on account of the shorter period of production 
they require. But on the other hand, not cvcry employment chosen for 
the utilization of capital goods accumulated by means of additional 
saving requires a process of production in which the period of pro- 
duction from today on to the maturing of the product is longer than 
with all processes already adopted previously. It may be that pcoplc, 
having satisfied thcir more urgent needs, now want goods which 
can be produced w-ithin a comparatively short period. The reason 
why these goods have not been produced previously was not that the 
period of production required for them alone was deemed too long, 
but that there was a more urgent employment open for the factors 
required. 

If one chooses to assert that every increase in the supply of capital 
goods available rcwlts in a Iengthening of the period of production 
and of waiting timc, one reasons in thc following way: If n are the 
goods already previously produced and b the goods p;oduced in the 
new processes startcd with thc aid of the increase in capital goods, 
it is obvious that people had to wait longer for a and b than they had 
to wait for a alone. In ordcr to producc rr and b it was not only neces- 
sary to acquire the capital goods required for the production of a, 
but also those required for the production of b. If one had expended 
for an increase of immediate consumption the means of sustenance 
savcd to make workcrs available for the production of b, one would 
have attained the satisfaction of some wants sooner. 

The treatment of the capital problem customary with those econ- 

omists who are opposed to the so-called "Austrian" view assumes that 

the technique cmployed in production is unalterably determined by 


Action in the Passing of Time 493 

the given state of technological knowledgc. The "Austrian" econ-
omists, on the other hand, show that it is the supply of capital goods 
available at cach momcnt that determines which of the many known 
technological methods of production will be empl~yed.~ 

The cor- 
rectness of thc "Austrian" point of view can easily be demonstrated 
by a scrutiny of the problem of scarcity of capital. 

Let us look at thc condition of a country suffering from scarcity of 
capital. Take, for instance, the state of affairs in Rumania about I 860. 
What was lacking was ccrtainly not technological knowledge. There 
was no secrecy concerning the technological methods practiced by 
the advanced nations of the West. l'hey were described in innumer- 
able books and taught at many schools. The elite of Rumanian youth 
had received full information about thcm at the technological uni-
versities of Austria, Switzerland, and France. Hundreds of foreign 
experts were ready to apply their knowledge and skill in Rumania. 
What was wanting was the capital goods needed for a transformation 
of the backward Rumanian apparatus of production, transportation, 
and communication according to Western patterns. If the aid granted 
to the Rumanians on the part of the advanced foreign nations had 
consisted merely in providing them with technological knowledge, 
they would have had to rcalize that it would take a very long time 
until they caught up with the West. The first thing for them to have 
done would haw been to savc in order to make workers and material 
factors of production available for the performance of more time- 
consuming proccsscs. Only then could they succcssivcly produce the 
tools required for the construction of those plants which in the fur- 
ther course were to produce the equipment needed for the construc- 
tion and operation of modcrn plants, farms, mines, railroads, telegraph 
lines, and buildings. Scores of decades would have passed until they 
had made up for the time lost. There would not have been any means 
of accelerating this process than by restricting current consump- 
tion as far as physiologically possible for the intermediary period. 

However, things devclopcd in a different way. The capitalist 
West lent to the backward countries the capital ioocls needed for 
an instantaneous transformation of a great part of their methods of 
production. It saved them time and made it possible for them to 
multiply very soon the productivity of their labor. The effect for

awkward indeed to attach to certain lines of thought national labels. As Hayck 
remarks pertinently (p. 47, n. I), the classical English economists since Ricardo, 
and particularly J. S. Mill (the latter probably partly under the influence of J. 
Rae) were in some regards more "Austrian" than their recent Anglo-Saxon 
successors.

the Rumanians was that they could immediatel\; enjoy the advantages 
derived from the modern technological procedures. It was as if they 
had started at a much earlier date to save and to accumulate capital 
goods. 

Shortage of capital means that one is further away from the at- 
tainment of a goal sought than if one had started to aim at it at an 
earlier date. Because one neglected to do this in the past, the inter- 
mediary products are wanting, although the nature-given factors 
from which they are to be produced are availablc. Capital shortage 
is dearth of time. It is the effect of the fact that one was late in 
beginning the march toward the aim concerned. It is impossible to 
dcscribe the advantages derived from capital goods available and 
the disadvantages resulting from the paucity of capital goods with- 
out resorting to the time element of sooner and later.g 

To have capital goods at one's disposal is tantamount to being nearer 
to a goal aimed at. An increment in capital goods available makes it 
possible to attain temporally remoter ends without being forced to 
restrict consumption. A loss in capital goods, on the other hand, makes 
it necessary either to abstain from striving after certain goals which 
one could aim at before or to restrict consumption. To havc capita1 
goods means, other things being equa1,'O a temporal gain. As against 
those who lack capital goods, the capitalist, under the given state of 
technological knowledge, is in a position to reach a definite goal 
sooner without restricting consumption and without increasing the 
input of labor and nature-given material factors of production. His 
head start is in time. A rival endowed with a smaller supply of capital 
goods can catch up only by restricting his consumption. 

The start which the peoples of the West have gained over the other 

peoples consists in the fact that they havc long since crcated the 

political and. institutional conditions required for a smooth and by 

and large uninterrupted progress of the process of larger-scalc saving, 

capital accumulation, and investment. Thus, by the middle of the 

nineteenth century, they had aiready attained a state of w-eii-being 

which far surpassed that of poorer races and nations less successful 

in substituting the ideas of acquisitive capitalism for those of predatory 

militarism. Left alone and unaided by foreign capital these backward 

peoples would have needed much more timc to improvc their meth- 

ods of production, transportation, and communication.

Action ir2 the Passing of Time 

development of the relations benveen West and East in the last 
centuries, if one does not comprehend the importance of this large- 
scale transfer of capital. Tbc West has given to the East not only 
technological and therapeutical knowledge, but also the capital goods 
needed for an immediate practical application of this knowledge. 
These nations of Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa have been able, 
thanks to the foreign capital imported, to reap the fruits of modern 
industry at an earlier date. They were to some extent relieved from 
the necessity of restricting their consumption in order to accumulate 
a sufficient stock of capital goods. This was the true nature of the 
alleged exploitation of the backward nations on the part of Western 
capitalism about which their nationaIists and the Marxians lament. 
It was a fecundation of the economically backward nations by the 
wealth of the more advanced nations. 

The benefits derived were mutual. What impelled the capitalists 
of the West to embark upon foreign investment was the demand 
of the consumers. Consumers asked for goods which could not be 
produced at a11 at home and for a'cheapening of goods which could 
be produced at home only with rising costs. If the consumers of the 
capitalist West had behaved in a different way or if the institutional 
obstacles to capital export had proved insurmountable, no capital 
export would have occurred. There would have been more longi- 
tudinal expansion of domestic production instead of lateral expansion 
abroad. 

It is not the task of catallactics but of history to deal with the con- 
sequences of the internationalization of the capital market, its work- 
ing, and its final disintegration brought about by the expropriation 
policies adopted by the receiving countries. Catallactics has only to 
scrutinize the effects of a richer or poorer supply of capital goods. 

We compare the conditions of two isolated market systems A and 

B. Both arevequal in size and population figures, the state of techno- 
logical knowledge, and in natural resources. They differ from one 
another only in the supply of capita1 goods, this supply being larger 
in A than in B. This enjoins that in A many processes of production 
are employed with which the output is greater per unit of input than 
with those employed in B.In B one cannot consider the adoption of 
these processes on account of the comparative scarcity of capital 
goods. Their adoption wouId require a restriction of consumption. 
In B many manipulations are performed by manual labor which in 
A are performed by labor-saving machines. In A goods are produced 
with a longer durability; in B one must abstain from producing them 
although the lengthening of durability is obtained by a less than

proportionate increase in input. In A the productivity of labor and 
consequently wage rates and the standard of living of the wage 
earners are higher than in B.I1 

Prolongation of 
the Period of Provision Beyond the Expected 
Duration of tl~e Actor's Life 

The judgments of value which determine the choice between satisfac- 
tion in nearer and in remoter periods of the future are expressive of present 
valuation and not of future valuation. They weigh the significance at- 
tached today to satisfaction in the nearer future against the significance 
attached today to satisfaction in the remoter future. 

The uneasiness which acting man wants to remove as far as possible is 
always present uneasiness, i.e., uneasiness felt in the very moment of action, 
and it always refers to future conditions. The actor is discontented today 
with thc expected state of affairs in various periods of the future and tries 
to alter it through purposive conduct. 

If action is primarily directed toward the improvement of other people's 
conditions and is thcrefore col-nmonly called altruistic, the uneasiness the 
actor wants to remove is his own present dissatisfaction with thc expected 
state of other people's affairs in various periods of the future. In taking 
care of other people he aims at alleviating his own dissatisfaction. 

It is thcrefore not surprising that acting man often is intent upon pro- 
longing the period of provision beyond the expected duration of his own 
life. 

Some Applications of the Time-Preference Theory 

Every part of economics is open to intentional misrepresentation and 
misinterpretation on the part of people eager to excuse or to justify falla- 
cious doctrines underlying their party programs. To prevent such misuse 
as far aspossible it seems expedient to add some explanatory remarks to the 
exposition of the time-preference theory. 

There are schools of thought which flatly deny that men differ with re- 
gard to innate characteristics inherited from their anccst~rs.~Vn the 
opinion of these authors the only difference between the white men of 

TT,


vvestern civiiizatior~a11d Eskimos is that the her are in arrears in their 
progress toward modern industrial civilization. This merely temporal 
difference of a few thousand years is insignificant when comparcd with 
the many hundreds of thousands of years which were absorbed by man's 
evolution from the simian state of his apelike forebears to the conditions 
of present-day homo sapiens. It does not support the assumption that racial 
differences prevail between the various specimens of mankind.

Action in the Passing of Time 

Praxeology and economics are foreign to the issues raised by this con- 
troversy. But they must take precautionary measures lest they become 
implicated by partisan spirit in this clash of antagonistic ideas. If those 
fanatically rejecting the teachings of modern genetics were not entirely 
ignorant of economics, they would certainly try to turn the time-pref- 
ercnce theory to their advantage. They would refer to the circumstance 
that the superiority of the Western nations consists merely in their having 
started earlier in endeavors to save and to accumuIate capital goods. They 
would explain this temporal difference by accidental factors, the better 
opportunity offered by environment. 

Against such possible misinterpretations one must emphasize the fact 
that the temporal head start gained by the Western nations was conditioned 
by ideological factors which cannot be, rcduced simply to the operation of 
environment. What is called human civilization has up to now been a prog- 
ress from cooperation by virtue of hegemonic bonds to cooperation by 
virtue of contractual bonds. But while many races and peoples were ar- 
rested at an early stage of this movement, others kept on advancing. The 
eminence of the Western nations consisted in the fact that they succeeded 
better in checking the spirit of predatory militarism than the rest of rnan- 
kind and that they thus brought forth the social institutions required for 
saving and investment on a broader scale. Even Marx did not contest the 
fact that private initiative and private ownership of the means of produc- 
tion were indispensable stages in the progress from primitive man's penury 
to the more satisfactory conditions of nineteenth-century Western Europe 
and North America. What the East lndies, China, Japan, and the Moham- 
medan countries lacked were institutions of safeguarding the individual's 
rights. The arbitrary administration of pashas, kadis, rajahs, mandarins, and 
daimios was not conducive to large-scale accumulation of capital. The legal 
guarantees effectively protecting the individual against expropriation and 
confiscation were the foundations upon which the unprecedented eco-
nomic progress of the West came into flowcr. These laws were not an out- 
growth of chance, historical accidents, and geographical environment. 
They were the product of reason. 

We do not know what course the history of Asia and Africa would have 
taken if these peoples had been left alone. What happened was that some 
of these peoples were subject to European rule and others-like China and 
Japan-wcre forced by the display of naval power to open their frontiers. 
The achievements of Western industrialism came to them from abroad. 
They w-ere ready to take advantage of the foreign capital lent to them and 
invested in their territories. But they were rather slow in the reception of 
the ideologies from which modern industrialism had sprung. Their assimi- 
lation to Western ways of life is superficial. 

We are in the midst of a revolutionary process which will very soon do 
away with all varieties of colonialism. This revolution is not limited to 
those countries which were subject to the ruIe of thc British. thc French 
and the Dutch. Even nations which without any infringement of their 


Human Action 

political sovereignty had profited from foreign capital are intent upon 
throwing off what they call the yoke of foreign capitalists. They are ex- 
propriating the foreigners by various devices-discriminatory taxation, rc- 
pudiation of debts, undisguised confiscation, foreign exchange restrictions. 
We are on the eve of the complete distintegration of the international 
capital market. The economic consequences of this event are obvious; its 
political repercussions are unpredictable. 

In order to appreciate the political consequences of the disintegration of 
the international capital market it is necessary to remember what effects 
were brought about by the internationalization of the capital market. 
Under the conditions of the later nineteenth century it did not matter 
whether or not a nation was prepared and equipped with the required 
capital in order to utilize adequately the natural resources of its territory. 
There was practically free access for everybody to every area's natural 
wealth. In searching for the most advantageous opportunities for invest- 
ment capitalists and promoters were not stopped by national borderlines. 
As far as investment for the best possible u'tilization of the known natural 
resources was concerned, the greater part of the earth's surface could be 
considered as integrated into a uniform world-embracing market system. 
It is true that this resuIt was attained in some areas, like the British and the 
Dutch East Indies and Malaya, only by colonial regimes and that autoch- 
thonous governments of these territories would probably not have created 
the institutional setting indispensable for the importation of capital. But 
Eastern and Southern Europe and the Western Hemisphere had of their 
own accord joined the community of the international capita1 market. 

'The Marxians were intent upon indicting foreign loans and investments 
for the lust for war, conquest, and colonial expansion. In fact the inter- 
nationalization of the capital market, together with free trade and the free- 
dom of migration, was instrumental in removing the economic incentives 
to war and conquest. It no longer mattered for a man where the political 
boundaries of his country were drawn. The entrepreneur and the investor 
were not checked by them. Precisely those nations which in the age preced- 
ing the first World War were paramount in foreign lending and invest- 
ment were committed to the ideas of peace-loving "decadent" liberalism. 
Of the foremost aggressor nations Russia, Italy, and Japan were not capital 
exporters; they themseives needed foreign capitai for the deveiopment of 
their own natural resourccs. Germany's imperialist adventures were not 
supported by its big business and finance.13 

The disappearance of the international capital market alters conditions 
entireIy. It abolishes the freedom of access to natural resourccs. If one of 
the socialist governments of the economically backward nations lacks the 
capital needed for the utilization of its natural resources, there will be no 
means to remedy this situation. If this system had been adopted a hundred 
years ago, it would have been impossible to exploit the oil fields of Mexico, 

13. Cf. ~Mises,Omnipotent Government (New Haven, 1944)-p. 99 and thc 
books quoted there. 

Action in the Passing of Time 

Venezuela, and Iran, to establish the rubber plantations in Malaya or to 
develop the banana production of Central America. It is illusoxy to assume 
that the advanced nations will acquiesce in such a state of affairs. They will 
resort to the only method which gives them access to badly needed raw 
materials; they wiIl resort to conquest. War is the alternative to freedom of 
foreign investment as realized by the international capital market. 

The inflow of foreign capital did not harm the receiving nations. It was 
European capital that accelerated considerably the marvelous economic 
evolution of the United States and the British Dominions. Thanks to 
foreign capital the countries of Latin America and Asia are today equipped 
with facilities for production and transportation which they would have 
had to forego for a very long time if they had not received this aid. Real 
wage rates and farm yields are higher today in those areas than they would 
have been in the absence of foreign capital. The mere fact that almost all 
nations are vehemcntly asking today for American credits explodes the 
fables of the Marxians and the nationalists. 

However, the mere lust for imported capital goods does not resuscitate 
the international capital market. Investment and lending abroad are only 
possible if the recciving nations are unconditionally and sincerely commit- 
ted to the principle of private property and do not plan to expropriate the 
foreign capitalists at a later date. It was such expropriations that destroyed 
the international capital market. 

Intergovernmental loans are no substitute for the functioning of an inter- 
national capital market. If they are granted on business terms, they prcsup- 
pose no less than private loans the fuIl acknowledgment of property rights. 
If they are granted, as is usually the case, as virtual subsidies without any 
regard for payment of principal and interest, they impose restrictions upon 
the debtor nation's sovereignty. In fact such "loans" are for the most part 
the price paid for military assistance in coming wars. Such military con- 
siderations already played an important role in the years in which the 
European powers prepared the great wars of our age. The outstanding 
example was provided by the huge sums which the French capitalists, 
pressed hard by the Government of the Third Republic, lent to Imperial 
Russia. The Tsars used the capita1 borrowed for armaments, not for an im- 
provement of the Russian apparatus of production. They did not invest 
it; they consumed a great part of it. 

5. The Convertibility of Capital Goods 
Capital goods are intermediary steps on the way toward a definite 
goal. If in the course of the period of production the goal is changed, 
it is not always possible to use the intermediary products already 
available for the pursuit of the new goal. Some of the capital goods 
become absolutely useless, and all expenditure made in their produc-
tion appears now as waste. Other capital goods can be utilized for the 


Human Action 

new project but only after having been subjected to a process of 
adjustment; it would have been possible to spare the costs required 
by this alteration if one had from the start aimed at the new goal. 
A third group of capital goods can be employed for the new process 
without any alteration; but if it had been known at the time they 
were produced that they would be used in the new way, it would 
have been possible to manufacture at smaller cost other goods which 
could render the same service. Finally there are also capital goods 
which can be employed for the new project just as well as for the 
original one. 

It would hardly be necessary to mention these obvious facts if it 
were not essential to refute popular misconceptions. There is no 
such thing as an abstract or ideal 'capital that exists apart from con- 
crete capital goods. If we disregard the role cash-holding plays in the 
composition of capital (we will deal with this problem in one of 
the later sections) we must realize that capital is always embodied in 
definite capital goods and is affected by everything that happens 
with regard to them. The value of an amount of capital is a derivative 
of the value of the capita1 goods in which it is embodied. The money 
equivalent of an amount of capital is the sum of the money equivalents 
of the aggregate of capital goods to which one refers in speaking of 
capital in the abstract. There is nothing which could be called "free" 
capital. Capital is always in the form of definite capital goods. These 
capital goods are better utilizable for some purposes, less utilizable 
for others, and absolutely useless for still other purposes. Every unit 
of capital is therefore in some way or other fixed capital, i.e., dedicated 
to definite processes of production. The businessman's distinction be- 
tween fixed capital and circulating capital is a difference of degree, 
not of kind. Everything that is valid with regard to fixed capital is 
also valid, although to a smaller degree, with regard to circulating 
capital. All capital goods have a more or less specific character. Of 
course, with many of them it is rather unlikely that a change in wants 
and plans will make them entirely useless. 

The more a definite process of production approaches its ultimate 
end, the closer becomes the tie between its intermediary products 
and the goal aimed at. Iron is less specific in character than iron 
tubes, and iron tubes less so than iron machine-parts. The conversion 
of a process of production becomes as a rule the more difficult, the 
farther it has been pursued and the nearer it has come to its terrnjna- 
tion, the turning out of consumers' goods. 

In looking at the process of capital accumulation from its very 
beginnings one can easily recognize that there cannot be such a thing 


Action in the Passing of Time 

as free capital. There is only capital embodied in goods of a more 
specific character and in goods of a less specific character. When the 
wants or the opinions concerning the methods of want-satisfaction 
change, the vaIue of the capita1 goods is altered accordingly. Addi- 
tional capita1 goods can come into existence only through making 
consumption lag behind current production. The additionaI capital 
is already in the very moment of its coming into existence embodied 
in concrete capital goods. These goods had to be produced before 
they could-as an excess of production over consumption-become 
capital goods. The role which the intraposition of money plays in 
the sequence of these events will be dealt with Iater. Here we need 
only recognize that even the capitalist whose whole capital consists 
in money and in claims to money does not own free capital. His funds 
are tied up with money. They are affected by changes in money's 
purchasing power and-as far as they are invested in claims to definite 
sums of money-also by changes in the debtor's solvency. 

It is expedient to substitute the notion of the convertibility of 
capital goods for the misleading distinction between fixed and free 
or circulating capital. The convertibility of capital goods is the op- 
portunity offered to adjust their utilization to a change in the data of 
production. Convertibility is graduated. It is never perfect, i.e., present 
with regard to all possible changes in the data. In the case of abso- 
lutely specific factors it is entirely absent. As the conversion of capital 
goods from the employment originally planned to other employ- 
ments becomes necessary through the emergence of unforeseen 
changes in the data, it is impossible to speak of convertibility in general 
without reference to changes in the data which have already occurred 
or are expected. A radical change in the data could make capital goods 
previously considered to be easily convertible either not convertible 
at all or convertible only with difficulty. 

It is obvious that in practice the problem of convertibility plays 
a greater role with goods the serviceability of which consists in render- 
ing a series of services over a period of time than with capital goods 
the serviceability of which is exhausted by rendering only one serv- 
ice in the process of production. The unused capacity of plants and 
transportation facilities and the scrapping of equipment which ac- 
cording to the plans underlying its production was designed for longer 
use are more momentous than the throwing away of fabrics and 
clothing out of fashion and of physically perishabIe goods. The 
problem of convertibility is peculiarly a problem of capital and 
capital goods only in so far as capital accounting makes it especially 
visible with regard to capital goods. Essentially it is a phenomenon 


Human Action 

present also in the case of consumers' goods which an individual 
has acquircd for his own use and consumption. If the conditions 
which resulted in their acquisition change, the problem of converti- 
bility becomes actual with them too. 

Capitalists and entrepreneurs in their capacity as owners of capital 
arc never perfectly frec; they are ncvcr on the eve of the first decision 
and action which will bind them. They are always already engaged 
in some way or other. Their funds are not outside the social process 
of production, but invested in definite lines. If they own cash, this 
is, according to the state of the market, either a sound or an unsound 
"investment"; but it is always an investment. They have either let 
slip the right moment for the'purchase of concrete factors of produc- 
tion which they must buy sooner or later, or the right moment to 
buy has not yet come. In the first case their holding of cash is un- 
sound; they have missed an opportunity. In the second case their 
choice was correct. 

Capitalists and entrepreneurs in expending moncy for the purchase 
of concretc factors of production value the goods exclusively from 
the point of view of the anticipated future state of the market. They 
pay prices adjusted to future conditions as they thcmsclves appraise 
them today. Errors committed in the past in thc production of capital 
goods available today do not burden the buyer; their incidence falls 
entirely on the seller. In this sense the entrepreneur who proceeds 
to buy against money capital goods for future production crosses 
out the past. His entrcprcneurial vcntures are not affected by changes 
which in the past occurred in the valuation and the prices of the 
factors of production he acquires. In this sense alone one may say 
that the owner of ready cash owns liquid funds and is free. 

6. The Influence of the Past Upon Action 
The more the accumulation of capital goods proceeds, the greater 
becomes the problem of convertibility. The primitive methods of 
farmers and handicraftsmen of earlier ages could more easily be ad-
justed to new tasks than modern capitalist methods. But it is pre- 
cisely modern capitalism that is faced with rapid changes in condi- 
tions. Changes in technological knowledge and in the demand of 
consumers as they occur daiIy in our time make obsoIete many of 
the plans directing the course of production and raise the question 
whether or not one should pursue the path started on. 

The spirit of sweeping innovation may get hold of men, may 
triumph over the inhibitions of sluggishness and indoIence, may incite 


Action in the Passing of Time 

the slothful slaves of routine to a radical rescission of traditional 
valuations, and may peremptorily urge people to enter upon new 
paths leading to new goals. Doctrinaires may try to forget that we are 
in all our endeavors the heirs of our fathers, and that our civilization, 
the product of a long evolution, cannot be transformed at one stroke. 
But however strong the propensity for innovation may be, it is kept 
in bounds by a factor that forces men not to deviate too hastily from 
the course chosen by their forebears. All material wealth is a residuum 
of past activities and is embodied in concrete capital goods of limited 
convertibility. The capital goods accumulated direct the actions of 
the living into lines which they would not have chosen if their dis- 
cretion had not been restricted by binding action accomplished in 
the past. The choice of ends and of the means for the attainment of 
those ends is influenced by the past. Capital goods are a conservative 
element. They force us to adjust our actions to conditions brought 
about by our own conduct in earlier days and by the thinking, choos- 
ing and acting of bygone generations. 

We may picture to ourselves the image of how things would be if, 
equipped with our present knowledge of natural resources, geogra- 
phy, technology, and hygienics, we had arranged all processes of 
production and manufactured all capital goods accordingly. We 
would have located the centers of production in other places. We 
would have populated the earth's surface in a different way. Some 
areas which are today denseIy inhabited and full of plants and farms 
would be less occupied. We would have assembled more people and 
morc shops and farms in other areas. All establishments would be 
equipped with the most efficient machines and tools. Each of them 
would be of the size required for the most economical utilization of its 
capacity of production. In the world of our perfect planning there 
would be no technological backwardness, no unused capacity to pro- 
duce, and no avoidable shipping of men or of goods. The productivity 
of human exertion would far surpass that prevailing in our actual, 
imperfect state. 

The writings of the socialists are full of such utopian fancies. 
Whether they call themselves Marxian or non-Marxian socialists, 
technocrats, or simply planners, they are all eager to show us how 
foolishly things are arranged in rcality and how happily men could 
live if they were to invest the reformers with dictatorial powers. It 
is only the inadequacy of the capitalist mode of production that pre- 
vents mankind from enjoying all the amenities which could be pro- 
duced under the contemporary state of technological knowledge. 

The fundamental error involved in this rationalistic romanticism 


5% Human Action 

is the misconception of the character of the capital goods available 
and of their scarcity. The intermediary products available today 
were manufactured in the past by our ancestors and by ourselves. ~ce 
plans which guided their production were an outgrowth of the then 
prcvailing ideas concerning cnds and technological procedures. If 
w-e consider aiming at different ends and choosing different methods 
of production, we are faced with an alternative. We must either 
leave unused a great part of the capital goods available and start afresh 
producing modern equipment, or we must adjust our production 
processes as far as possible to the specific character of the capital goods 
available. The choice rests, as it always does in the market economy, 
with the consumers. Their conduct in buying or not buying settles 
the issue. In choosing between old tenements and new ones equipped 
with all the gadgets of comfort, between railroad and motorcar, be- 
tween gas and electric light, between cotton and rayon goods, be- 
tween silk and nylon hosiery, they implicitly choose between a con-
tinued employment of previously accumulated capital goods and 
their scrapping. When an old building which could still be inhabited 

for years is not prematurely demolished and replaced by a modern 
house because the tenants are not preparcd to pay high& rents and 
prefer to satisfy other wants instcad of living in more comfortabIe 
homes, it is obvious how prescnt consumption is influcnced by condi- 

tions of the past. 

The fact that not every technological improvement is instantly 
applied in the whole field is not more conspicuous than the fact that 
not everybody throws away his old car or his old clothes as soon as 
a better car is on the marlrct or new patterns become fashionable. In 
all such things people are motivatcd by the scarcity of goods available. 

A new machine, more efficient than those used previously, is 
constructed. Whether or not the plants equipped with the old, less 
efficient machincs will discard them in spite of the fact that they are 
still utilizable and replace them by the new nlodcl depends on the 
degree of the new machine's superiority. Only if this superioriw 
is great enough to compensate for the additional expenditure required, 
is the scrapping of the old equipment economically sound. Let p be 
the price of the new machine, q the price that can be realized by 
selling the old machine as scrap iron, a the cost of producing one 
unit of product by the old machine, b the cost of producing one unit 
of product by the new machine without taking into account the 
costs required for its purchase. Let us further assume that the emi- 
nence of the new machine consists rnercly in a better utilization of 
raw material and labor employed and not in manufacturing a greater 


Action in the Passing of Time 

quantity of products and that thus the annual output z remains un- 
changed. Then the replacement of the old machine by the new one is 
advantagzous if the yield z (a -b) is large enough to make good for 
the expenditure of p -q. We may disregard the writing off of de- 
preciation in assuming that the annual quotas arc not greater for the 
new machine than for the old one. The same considerations hold true 
also for the transfer of an already existing plant from a place in which 
conditions of production are less favorable to a location offering 
more favorable conditions. 

Technological backwardness and economic inferiority are two dif- 
ferent things and must not be confused. It can happen that a produc- 
tion aggregate w-hich from a merely technological point of view 
appears outclassed is in a position to compete successfully with 
aggregates better equipped or located at more favorable sites. The 
degree of the superiority provided by the technologically more 
efficient equipment or by the more propitious location as compared 
with the surplus expenditure required for the transformation decides 
the issue. This relation depends on the convertibility of the capital 
goods concerned. 

The distinction between technological perfection and economic 
expediency is not, as romantic engineers would have us believe, a 
feature of capitalism. It is true that only economic calculation as 
possible solely in a market economy gives the opportunity to establish 
all th: computations required for the cognition of the relevant facts. 
A socialist nlanagement .would not be in a position to ascertain the 
state of affairs by arithmetical methods. It would therefore not know 
xvhetlier or not what it plans and puts into operation is the most ap- 
propriate procedure to employ the means available for the satisfaction 
of what it considers to be the kost urgent of the still unsatisfied wants 
of the people. But if it were in a position to calculate, it would not 
proceed in a way difFerent from that of the calculating businessman. 
It would not squander scarce factors of production for the satisfaction 
of wants deemed iess urgent if this wouid prevent the satisfaction of 
morc urgent wants. It would not hurry to scrap still utilizable produc- 
tion facilities if thc investment required would impair the expansion 
of thc production of more urgently needed goods. 

If one takrs the problem of convertibility into proper account, 
on: cnn easilv explode manv widespread fallacies. Take, for instance, 
th; infnnt industries argument advanced in favor of protection. Its 
s~lnportmassert that temporary protection is needed in order to 
develop proccssing industries in places in which natural conditions 
for their operation are more favorable or, at least, no less favorable 


Human Action 
than in the areas in which the older established competitors are located. 
These older industries have acquired an advantage by their early 
start. They are now fostered by a merely historical, accidental, and 
manifestly "irrational" factor. This advantage prevents the establish- 
ment of competing plants in areas the conditions of which give 
promise of becoming able to produce more cheaply than, or at 
least as cheaply as, the old ones. It may be admitted that protection 
for infant industries is temporarily expensive. But the sacrifices made 
will be more than repaid by the gains to be reaped later. 
The truth is that the establishment of an infant industry is ad- 
vantageous from the economic point of view only if the superiority 
of the new location is so momentous that it outweighs the disad- 
vantages resulting from the abandonment of nonconvertible and non- 
transferable capital goods invested in the older established plants. If 
this is the case, the new plants will be able to compete successfully 
with the old ones without any aid given by the government. If it 
is not the case, the protection granted to thcm is wasteful, even if 
it is only temporary and enables the new industry to hold its own at a 
later period. The tariff amounts virtually to a subsidy which the con- 
sumers are forced to pay as a compensation for the employment of 
scarce factors of production for the replacement of still utilizable 
capital goods to be scrapped and the withholding of these scarce 
factors from other employments in which they could render services 
valued higher by the consumers. The consumers are deprived of the 
opportunity to satisfy certain wants because the capital goods re- 
quired are directed toward the production of goods which were al- 
ready available for them in the absence of tariffs. 
There prevails a universal tendency for all industries to move to 
those locations in which the potentialities for production are most 
propitious. In the unhampered market economy this tendencv is 
slowed down as much as due consideration to the inconvertibkty 
of scarce capital goods requires. This historical element does not 
give a permanent superiority to the old industries. It only prevents 
the waste originating from investments which bring about unused 
capacity of still utilizable production facilities on the one hand and 
a restriction of capital goods available for the satisfaction of un-
satisfied wants on the other hand. In the absence of tariffs the migra- 
tion of industries is postponed until the capita1 goods investcd in the 
old plants are worn out or become obsolete by technological im- 
provements which are so momentous as to necessitate their replace- 
ment by new equipment. The industrial history of the United States 
povidls numerous examples of the shifting, within the boundaries 


Action in the Passing of Time 

of the country, of centers of industrial production which was not 
fostered by any protective measures on the part of the authorities. 
The infant industries argument is no less spurious than all the other 
arguments advanced in favor of protection. 

Another popuIar fallacy refers to the alleged suppression of useful 
patents. A patent is a legal monopoly granted for a limited number 
of years to the inventor of a new contrivance. At this point we are 
not concerned with the question whether or not it is a good policy to 
grant such exclusive privileges to inventors.14 We have to deal only 
with the assertion that "big business" misuses the patent system to 
withhold from the public benefits it could derive from technological 
improvement. 

In granting a patent to an inventor the authorities do not investigate 
the invention's economic significance. They are concerned merely 
with the priority of the idea and limit their examination to technologi- 
cal problems. They deal with the same impartial scrupulousness with 
an invention which revolutionizes a whole industry and with some 
trifling gadget, the uselessness of which is obvious. Thus patent pro- 
tection is provided to a vast number of quite worthless inventions. 
Their authors are ready to overrate the importance of their contri- 
bution to the progress of technological knowledge and build exag- 
gerated hopes upon the material gain it could bring them. Disap- 
pointed, they grumble about the absurdity of an economic sys- 
tem that deprives the people of the benefi; of technological prog- 
ress. 

The conditions under which it is economical to substitute new 
i~nproved equipment for still utilizable older tools have been pointed 
out above. If these conditions are absent, it does not pay, either for 
private enterprise in a market economy or for the socialist manage- 
ment of a totalitarian system, to adopt the new technological process 
immediately. The new machinery to be produced for new plants, 
the expansion of already existing plants and the replacement of old 
equipment torn out will be effected according to the new design. 
But the still utilizable equipment will not be scrapped. The new proc- 
ess will bc adopted only step by step. The plants equipped with the 
old devices are for some time still in a position to stand the competi- 
tion of those equippcd with the new ones. Those questioning the 
correctness of this statement should ask themselves whether they 
always throw away their vacuum cleaners or radio sets as soon as 
better models are offered for sale. ' 

It does not make any difference in this regard whether the new 

14. Cf. above, pp. 382-383, and below, pp. 676677. 

Human Action 
invention is or is not protected by a patent. A firm that has acquired 
a license has already expended money for the new invention. If it 
nonetheless does not adopt the new method, the reason is that its 
adoption does not pay. It is of no avail that the government-created 
nlonopoly which the patent provides prevents competitors from 
applying it. What counts alone is the degree of superiority secured 
by the new invention as against old methods. Superiority means re- 
duction in the cost of production per unit or such an improvement 
in the quality of the product that buyers are ready to pay adequately 
higher prices. The absence of a sufficient degree of superioritv to 
make the cost of transformation profitable is proof of the fact-that 
consumers are more intent upon acquiring other goods than upon en- 
joying the benefits of the new invention. It is the consumers with 
whom the ultimate decision rests. 
Superficial observers sometimes fail to see these facts because they 
are deluded by the practice of many big enterprises of acquiring the 
rights granted by a patent in their field regardIess of its usefulness. 
This practice stems from various considerations: 

I. The economic significance of the innovation is not yet recog- 
nizable. 
z. The innovation is obviously useless. But the firm beIieves that it 
could develop it in such a way as to make it useful. 
3. The immediate application of the innovation does not pay. But 
the firm intends to apply it later when replacing its worn-out equip- 
ment. 
4. The firm wants to encourage the inventor to continue his re- 
search in spite of the fact that up to now his endeavors have not re- 
sulted in a practically utilizable innovation. 
j. The firm wants to placate litigious inventors in order to spare 
the money, time, and nervous strain which frivolous infringement 
suits bring about. 
6. The firm resorts to hardly disguised bribery or yields to veiled 
3.
o~ackmaii when paying for quite usciess patents to oficers, engineers, 
or other influential personnel of firnis or institutions which are its 
customers or potential customers. 

If an invention is so superior to the old processes that it makes the 
old equipment obsolete and peremptorily demands its immediate re- 
placement by new machines, the transformation will be effected no 
matter whether the privilege conferred by the patcnt is in the hands 
of the owners of the old equipmeht or of an independent firm. The 
assertions to the contrary are based on the assumption that not only 
the inventor and his attorneys but aIso all people already active in 


Action in the Passing of Time 

the field of production concerned or prepared to enter into it if an 
opportunity is offered to them fail entirely to grasp the importance 
of the invention. The inventor sells his rights to the old firm for a 
trifle because no one else wants to acquire them. And this old firm is 
also too dull to see the advantages that it could derive from the ap- 
plication of the invention. 

Now, it is true that a technological improvement cannot be 
adopted if people are blind to its usefulness. Under a socialist manage- 
ment the incompetence or stubborness of the officers in charge of 
the department concerned would be enough to prevent the adoption 
of a more economical method of production. The same is the case 
with regard to inventions in fields dominated by the government. 
The most conspicuous examples are provided by the failure of 
eminent military experts to comprehend the significance of new 
devices. The great Napoleon did not recognize the help which steam- 
boats could give to his plans to invade Great Britain; both Foch and 
the German general staff underestimated on the eve of the first World 
War the importance of aviation, and later the eminent pioneer of air 
power, General Billy Mitchell, had very unpleasant experiences. But 
things are entirely different in the orbit in which the market economy 
is not hampered by bureaucratic narrow-mindedness. There a tend-
ency to overrate rather than to underestimate the potentialities of 
an innovation prevails. The history of modern capitalism shows in- 
numerable instances of abortive attempts to push innovations which 
proved futile. Many promoters have paid heavily for unfounded 
optimism. It would be more realistic to blame capitalism for its 
propensity to over-value useless innovations than for its alleged sup- 
pression of useful innovations. It is a fact that large sums have been 
wasted for the purchase of quite useless patent rights and for fruitless 
ventures to apply them in practice. 

It is absurd to speak of an alleged bias of modern big business 
against technological improvement. The great corporations spend 
hrirrp PIT-S the sCzr& processes afid fie.,t. devices.

Those lamenting an alleged suppression of inventions on the part 
of free enterprise must not think that they have proved their case 
by referring to the fact that many patents are either never utilized 
at all or only used after a long delay. It is manifest that numerous 
patents, perhaps the far greater number of them, are quite useless. 
Those alleging suppression of useful innovations do not cite a single 
instance of such an innovation's being unused in the countries pro- 
tecting it by a patent while it is used by the Soviets-no respecters of 
patent privileges. 


51° Hman Action 
The limited convertibility of capital goods plays an important 
role in human geography. The present distribution of human abodes 
and industrial centers over the earth's surface is to a certain degree 
determined by historical factors. The fact that definite sites were 
chosen in a distant past is still operative. There prevails, it is true, a 
universal tendency for people to move to those areas which offer the 
most propitious potentialities for production. However, this tendency 
is restrained not only by institutional factors, such as migration 
barriers. A historical factor also plays a momentous role. Capital goods 
of limited convertibility have been invested in areas which, from the 
point of view of our present knowledge, offer less favorable op- 
portunities. Their immobilization counteracts the tendency to locate 
plants, farms, and dwelling places according to the state of our 
contemporary information about geography, geology, plant and 
animal physiology, climatology, and other branches of science. 
Against the advantages of moving toward sites offering better physical 
opportunities one must weigh the disadvantages of leaving unused 
capital goods of limited convertibility and transferability. 
Thus the degree of convertibility of the supply of cipital goods 
available affects all decisions concerning production and consumption. 
The smaller the degree of convertibility, the more realization of 
technological improvement is delayed. Yet it would be absurd to 
refer to this retarding effect as irrational and antiprogressive. To 
consider, in planning action, all the advantages and disadvantages 
expected and to weigh them against one another is a manifestation of 
rationality. Not the soberly calculating businessman, but the romantic 
technocrat is to blame for a delusive incomprehension of reality. 
What sloxvs down technological improvemenr is not the imperfect 
convertibility of capital goods, but their scarcity. We arc not rich 
enough to renounce the services which still utilizable capital goods 
could provide. The fact that a supply of capital goods is available 
does not check progress; it is, on the contrary, the indispensable 
condition of any improvement and progress. The heritage of the past 
embodied in our suppIy of capital goods is our wealth and the fore- 
most means of further advancement in well-being. It is true, we 
would be stilI better off if our ancestors and we ourselves in our 
past actions had succeeded in better anticipating the conditions under 
which we must act today. The cognizance of this fact explains many 
phenomena of our time. But it does not cast any blame upon the 
past nor does it show any imperfection inherent in the market econ- 
omy.

7. Accumulation, Maintenance and Consumption 
of Capital 
Capita1 goods are intcrmediary products which in the further 
course of production activities are transforrncd into consumers' 
goods. All capital goods, including those not called perishable, perish 
cither in wearing out their serviceablencss in the performance of 
production proccsses or in losing their serviceablencss, evcn before 
this happens, through a change in the market data. There is no 
question of keeping a stock of capital goods intact. They are transient. 

The notion of wealth constancy is an outgrowth of deliberate 
planning and acting. It refers to the concept of capital as applied in 
capital accounting, not to the capital goods as such. The idca of 
capital has no counterpart in the physical universe of tangible things. 
It is nowhcre but in the minds of planning mcn. It is an element in 
economic calculation. Capita1 accounting serves one purpose only. 
It is dcsigncd to make us know how our arrangement of production 
and consumption acts upon our power to satisfy future wants. The 
question it answers is whether a certain course of conduct increases 
or dccreases thc productivity of our future exertion. 

The intention of preserving the avaiIable supply of capital goods 
in full power or of increasing it could also direct the actions of men 
who did not have the mental too1 of economic calculation. Primitive 
fishcrmen and hunters were certainly aware of the difference between 
maintaining their tools and devices in good shape and serviceableness 
and wearing them out without providing for adequate replacements. 
An old-fashioned peasant, committed to traditional routine and 
ignorant of accountancy, knows very we11 the significance of main- 
taining intact his live and dead stock. Under the simple conditions 
of a stationary or slowly progrcssing cconorny it is feasible to operate 
successfully evcn in the abscnce of capital accounting. There the 
maintcnance of a by and large u~~changed supply of capital goods 
can be effccted either by currcnt production of pieces destined 
to replace those worn out or by the accumuIation of a fund of con- 
sumcrs' goods which makes it possible to devote effort at a latcr time 
toward the replacement of such capital goods without bcing forced 
to restrict consumption temporarily. But a changing industrial econ- 
omy cannot do without economic calculation and its fundamental 
concepts of capita1 and income. 

Conceptual realism has muddied the comprehension of the con- 


Human Action 

cept of capital. It has brought about a mythology of capital.15 An 
existence has been attributed to "capital," independent of the capital 
goods in which it is embodied. Capital, it is said, reproduces itself and 
thus provides for its own maintenance. Capital, says the Marxian, 
hatches out profit. All this is nonsense. 

Capital is a praxeological concept. If we were to resort to the 
terminology of traditional philosophy, which is characterized by 
neglect of all praxeological issues, we could call it a voIuntaristic 
concept. It is a product of reasoning, and its placc is in the human 
mind. It is a mode of looking at the problems of acting, a method of 
appraising them from the point of view of a definite plan. It dcter- 
mines the course of human action and is, in this scnsc only, a real 
factor. It is inescapably linked with capitalism, the market economy. 
It is a mere shadow in economic systems in which there is no market 
exchange and no money prices of goods of all orders. 

The capital concept is operative as far as men in their actions let 
themselves be guided by capital accounting. If the entrepreneur has 
employed factors of production in such a way that the money equiv- 
alent of the products at least equals the money equivalent of the 
factors expended, he is in a position to replace the capital goods ex- 
pended by new capital goods the money equivalent of which equals 
the money equivalent of those expended. But the employment of the 
gross proceeds, their allotment to the maintenance of capital, con- 
sumption, and the accumulation of new capital is always the outcome 
of purposive action on the part of the entrepreneurs and capitalists. 
It is not "automatic"; it is by necessity the result of deliberate action. 
And it can be frustrated if the computation on which it is based was 
vitiated by negligence, error, or misjudgment of future conditions. 

Additional capital can be accumulated only by saving, i.e.. a surplus 
of production over consumption. Saving may consist in a restriction 
of consumption. But it can also be brought about, without a further 
restriction in consumption and without a change in the input of capita1

in different ways: 

I. hTatural conditions have become more propitious. Harvests are 
more plentiful. People have access to more fertile soil and have dis- 
covered mines yielding higher returns per unit of input. Cataclysms 
and catastrophes which in repeated occurrence frustrated human 
effort have become less frequent. Epidemics and cattle plagucs have 
subsided. 
'5. Cf. Hayek, "The Mythology of Capital," The Quarterly Joqmnl of 
Economics, L (1936), 223 ff. 


Action in the Passing of Time 

z. People have succeeded in rendering some production processes 
more fruitful without investing more capital goods and without a 
further lengthening of the period of production. 
3. institutional disturbances of production activitics have become 
lcss frccpent. The losses caused by war, rcvolutions, strikes, sabotage, 
and other crimes have been reduced. 
If the surpluses thus brought about arc employed as additional 
investment, they further increase future net proceeds. Then it be- 
comes possible to expand consumption without prejudice to the sup- 
ply of capital goods available and the productivity of labor. 

Capital is always accumulated by individuals or groups of individ- 
uals acting in concert, nevcr by the Volkswirtschaft or the society.'" 
It may happen that while some actors are accumulating additional 
capital, others are at the same time consuming capital previously 
accumulated. If these two processes are equal in amount, the sum 
of the capital funds avajlabIe in the market system remains unaltered 
and it is as if no change in the total amount of capital goods available 
had occurred. The accumulation of additional capital on the part of 
some people merely removes the necessity of shortening the period 
of production of some processcs. But no further adoption of processes 
with a longer period of production becomes feasible. If we look at 
affairs from this angle wc may say that: a transfer of capital took place. 
But one must guard oneself against confusing this notion of capital 
transfer with the conveyance of property from one individual or 
group of individuals to others. 

The sale and purchase of capital goods and the loans granted to 
business are not as such capita1 transfer. They are transactions which 
are instrumental in conveying the concretc capital goods into the 
hands of those entrepreneurs who want to employ them for the 
performance of definite projects. They are only ancillary steps in 
the course of a long-range sequence of acts. lheir composite effect 
decides the success or failure of the whole project. But neither profit 
nor loss directly brings about either capita1 accumulation or capital 
consumption. It is the way in which those in whose fortune profit 
or loss occurs arrange their consumption that alters the amount of 
capital available. 

Capital transfer can be effected both without and with a convey- 
ance in the owncrship of capital goods. The formcr is the casc when 
one man consumes capital while another man independentlv ac-
cumulates capital in the same amount. The latter is the case if the 

16.The state and the municipaliries, in the market economy, are also merely 
actors representing concerted action on the part of definite groups of individuals. 

5'4 Human Action 

seller of capital goods consumes the proceeds while the buyer pays 
the price out of a nonconsumed-saved-surplus of net proceeds 
over consumption. 

Capital consumption and the physical extinction of capital goods 
are two different things. A11 capital goods sooner or later enter into 
final products and cease to exist through use, consumption, wear 
and tear. What can be preserved by an appropriate arrangement of 
consumption is only the value of a capital fund, never the concrete 
capital goods. It may sometimes happen that acts of God or man- 
made destruction result in so great an extinction of capital goods that 
no possible restriction of consumption can bring about in a short time 
a replenishment of the capital funds to its previous level. But what 
brings about such a depletion is always the fact that the net proceeds 
of current production devoted to the maintenance of capital are not 
sufficiently large. 

8. The Mobility of the Investor 
The limited convertibility of the capital goods does not immovably 
bind their owner. The investor is free to alter the investment of his 
funds. If he is able to anticipate the future state of the market more 
correctly than other people, he can succeed in choosing only invest- 
ments whose price will rise and in avoiding investments whose price 
will drop. 

Entrepreneurial profit and loss emanate from the dedication of 
factors of production to definite projects. Stock exchange specula- 
tion and analogous transactions outside the securities market deter- 
mine on whom the incidence of these profits and losses shall fall. 
A tendency prevails to make a sharp distinction between such purely 
speculative ventures and genuinely sound investment. The distinc- 
tion is one of degree only. There is no such thing as a nonspeculative 
investment. In a changing economy action always involves specula- 
tion. Investments may be good or bad, but they are always speculative. 
A radical change in conditions may render bad even investments 
commonly considered perfectly safe. 

Stock speculation cannot undo past action and cannot change any- 

thing with regard to the limited convertibility of capital goods al- 

ready in existence. What it can do is prevent additional investment in 

branches and enterprises in yhich, according to the opinion of the 

speculators, it would be misplaced. It points the specific way for 

a tendency, prevailing in the market economy, to expand profitable 

production ventures and to restrict the unprofitable. In this sense the 

stock exchange becomes simply "the market," the focal point of the 


Action in the Passing of Time 

market economy, the ultimate device to make the anticipated de- 
mand of the consumers supreme in the conduct of business. 

The mobility of the investor manifests itself in the phenomenon 
called capital flight. Individual investors can go away from invest- 
ments which they consider unsafe provided that they are ready to 
take the loss already discounted by the market. Thus they can pro- 
tect themselves against anticipated further losses and shift them to 
people who are less realistic in their appraisal of the future prices of 
the goods concerned. Capital flight does not withdraw inconvertible 
capital goods from the lines of their investment. It consists merely 
in a change of ownership. 

It makes no difference in this regard whether the capitalist "flees" 
into another domestic investment or into a foreign investment. One 
of the main objectives of foreign exchange control is to prevent 
capital flight into foreign countries. However, foreign exchange 
control only succeeds in preventing the owners of domestic in- 
vestments from restricting their losses by exchanging in time a 
domestic investment they consider unsafe for a foreign investment 
they consider safer. 

If all or certain classes of domestic investment are threatened by 
partial or total expropriation, the market discounts the unfavorable 
consequences of this policy by an adequate change in their prices. 
When this happens, it is too late to resort to flight in order to avoid 
being victimized. Only those investors can come off with a small 
loss who are keen enough to forecast the disaster at a time when the 
majority is still unaware of its approach and its significance. What- 
ever the various capitalists and entrepreneurs may do, they can never 
make mobile and transferable inconvertible capital goods. While this, 
at least, is admitted by and large with regard to fixed capital, it is 
denied with regard to circulating capital. It is asserted that a business-
man can export products and fail to reimport the proceeds. People 
do not see that an enterprise cannot continue its operations when de- 
prived of its circulating capital. If a businessman exports his own 
funds employed for the current purchase of raw materials, labor, 
and other essential requirements, he must replace them by funds 
borrowed. The grain of truth in the fable of the mobility of cir- 
culating capital is the fact that it is possible for an investor to avoid 
losses menacing his circulating capital independently of the avoidance 
of such losses menacing his fixed capital. However, the process of 
capital flight is in both instances the same. It is a change in the person 
of the investor. The investment itself is not affected; the capital 
concerned does not emigrate. 


Human Action 

Capital flight into a foreign country presupposes the propensity 
of foreigners to exchange their investments abroad against those in 
the country from which capital flees. A British capitalist cannot flee 
from his British investments if no foreigner buys them. It foilows that 
capital flight can never result in the much talked about deterioration 
of the balance of payments. Seither can it tnake foreign exchange 
rates rise. If many capitalists-whether British or foreign-want to 
get rid of British securities, a drop in their prices will ensue. But it 
u41 not affect the exchange ratio between the sterling and foreign 
currencies. 

The same is valid with regard to capital invested in ready cash. 
The owner of French francs who anticipates the consequences of 
the French Government's inflationary policy can either flee into 
"real goods" by the purchase of goods or into foreign exchange. 
But he must find people \vho are ready to take francs in exchange. 
He can flee only as long as there are still people left who appraise 
the future of the franc more optimistically than hc himself does. 
What makes commodity prices and foreign exchange rates rise is 
not the conduct of those ready to give away francs, but the conduct 
of those refusing to take them except at a low rate of exchange. 

Governments pretend that in resorting to foreign exchange re- 
strictions to prevent capital flight they are motivated by considera- 
tion of the nation's vital interests. What they really bring about is 
contrary to the materiai interests of many citizens without any 
benefit to any citizen or to the phantom of the Volkswirtschaft. If 
there is inflation going on in France, it is certainly not to the advan- 
tage either of the nation as a whole or of any citizen that all the 
disastrous consequences should affect Frenchmen only. If some 
Frenchmen were to unload the burden of these losses on foreigners 
hy selling them French banknotes or bonds redeemable in such 
banknotes, a part of these losses would fall upon foreigners. The 
manifest outcome of the prevention of such transactions is to make 
some Frenchmen poorer without malting any Frenchmen richer. 
From the nationalist point of view this hardly seems desirable. 

PopuIar opinion finds something objectionable in every possible 
aspect of stock market transactions. If prices are rising, the specula- 
tors are denounced as profiteers who appropriate to themsclves what 
by rights belongs to other people. If prices drop, the spxulators are 
denounced for squandering the nation's wealth. The profi:s of the 
speculators are vilified as robbery and thzft at the expense of the 
rest of the nation. It is insinuated that they are the cause of the 
public's poverty. It is customary to draw a distinction between 


Action in the Passing of Time 

this dishonest bounty of the jobbers and the profits of the manu- 
facturer who does not merely gamble but supplies the consumers. 
Even financial writers fail to realize that stock exchange transactions 
produce neither profits nor losses, but are only the consummation 
of profits and losses arising in trading and manufacturing. These 
profits and losses, the outgrowth of the buying public's approval or 
disapproval of the investments effected in the past, are made visible 
by the stock market. The turnover on the stock market does not 
affect the public. It is, on the contrary, the public's reaction to the 
mode in which investors arranged production activities that det.er- 
mines the price structure of the securities market. It is ultimately the 
consumers' attitude that makes some stocks rise, others drop. Those 
not saving and investing neither profit nor lose on account of fluctua- 
tions in stock exchange quotations. The trade on the securities mar- 
ket merely decides which investors shaIl earn profits and which shall 

suffer losses.1T 

9. Money and Capital; Saving and Investment 
Capital is computed in terms of money and represents in such ac- 
counting a definite sum of money. But capital can also consist of 
amounts of money. As capital goods also are exchanged and as such 
exchanges are effected under the same conditions as the exchange of 
all other goods, here too indirect exchange and the use of money 
become peremptory. In the market economy no participant can 
forego the advantages which cash-holding conveys. Not only in 
their capacity as consumers, but also in their capacity as capitalists 
and entrepreneurs, individuals are under the necessity of keeping 
cash holdings. 

Those who have seen in this fact something puzzling and contra- 
dictory have been misled by a misconstruction of monetary calcula- 
tion and capital accounting. They attempt to assign to capital account- 
ing tasks which it can never achieve. Capital accounting is a mental 
tool of calculating and computing suitable for individuals and groups 
of individuals acting in the market economy. Only in the frame of 
monetary calculation can capital become computable. The sole task 
that capital accounting can perform is to show to the various individ- 
uals acting within a market economy whether the money equiv- 
alent of their funds devoted to acquisitive action has changed and to 
what extent. For all other purposes capital accounting is quite useless.

is critically analyzed and entirely refuted by F. Machlup, The Stock Marker, 
Credit and Capital Formation, trans. by V.Smith (London, 1940)~pp. 6-1jj. 

Hunzan Action 
If one tries to ascertain a magnitude called the volks.'~i~tschaftliche 
capital or the social capital as distinct both from the acquisitive capital 
of various individuals and from the meaningless concept of the sum 
of the various individual's acquisitive capital funds, then, of course, 
one is troubled by a spurious problem. What is the role of money, 
one asks, in such a concept of social capital? One discovers a momen- 
tous difference between capita1 as seen from the individual's point of 
view and as seen from the standpoint of society. However, this 
whole reasoning is utterly fallacious. It is obviously contradictory to 
eliminate reference to money from the computation of a magnitude 
which cannot be computed otherwise than in terms of money. It is 
nonsensical to resort to monetary calculation in an attempt to ascertain 
a magnitude which is meaningIess in an economic system in which 
there cannot be any money and no money prices for factors of 
production. As soon as our reasoning passes beyond the frame of a 
market society, it must renounce every reference to money and 
money prices. The concept of social capital can only be thought of 
as a collection of various goods. It is impossible to compare nvo 
colIections of this type otherwise than by declaring that one of them 
is more serviceable in removing the uneasiness felt by the whole of 
society than the other. (Whether or not such a comprehensive judg- 
ment can be pronounced by any mortal man is another question,) 
No monetary expression can be applied to such collections. Mone- 
tary terms are void of any meaning in dealing with the capital prob- 
lems of a social system in which there is no market for factors of 
production. 
In recent years economists have paid special attention to the role 
cash holding plays in the process of saving and capital accumulation. 
Many fallacious conclusions have been advanced about this role. 
If an individual employs a sum of money not for consumption but 
for the purchase of factors of production, saving is directly turned 
into capital accumulation. If the individual saver employs his addi- 
tionai savings for increasing his cash holding because this is in his 
eyes the most advantageous mode of using them, he brings about a 
tendency toward a fall in commodity prices and a rise in the mone- 
tary unit's purchasing power. If we assume that the supply of money 
in the market system does not change, this conduct on the part of the 
saver will not directly influence the accumulation of capital and its 
employment for an expansion of production.18 The effect of our 

18. Indirectly capital accumulation is affected by the changes in wealth and in- 
comes which every instance of cash-induced change in the purchasing power of 
money brings about. 

Action in the Passing of Time 

saver's saving, i.e., the surplus of goods produced over goods con- 
sumed, does not disappear on account of his hoarding. The prices 
of capital goods do not rise to the height they would have attained 
in the absence of such hoarding. But the fact that more capital goods 
are available is not affected by the striving of a number of people 
to increase their cash holdings. If nobody employs the goods-the 
nonconsumption of which brought about thc additional saving-for 
an expansion of his consumptive spending, they remain as an incre- 
ment in the amount of capital goods available, whatever their prices 
may be. The two processes-increased cash holding and increased 
capital accumulation-take place side by side. 

A drop in commodity prices, other things being equal, causes 
a drop in the money equivalent of the various individuals' capital. 
But this is not tantamount to a reduction in the supply of capital goods 
and does not require an adjustment of prod~~ction 

activities to an 
alleged impoverishment. It merely alters the moncy items to be ap- 
plied in monetary calculation. 

Now let us assume that an increase in thc quantity of credit money 
or of fiat money or credit expansion produces the additional money 
required for an expansion of the individuals' cash holdings. Then 
three processes takc their course indcpendently: a tendency toward 
a fall in commodity prices brought about by the increase in the 
amount of capital goods available and the resulting expansion of 
production activities, a tendency toward a fall in prices brought about 
by an increased demand of money for cash holding, and finally a 
tendency toward a rise in prices brought about by the increase in 
the supply of money (in the broader sense). The three processes 
are to some extent synchronous. Each of them brings about its 
particular effects which, according to the circumstances, may be 
intensified or weakened by the opposite effects originating from 
one of the other two. But the main thing is that the capital goods 
resulting from the additional saving are not destroyed by the coinci- 
dent monctary changes-changes in the demand for and the supply 
of money (in the broader sense). Whenever an individual devotes 
a sum of money to saving instead of spending it for consumption, the 
proccss of saving agrees perfectly with the process of capital ac- 
cumulation and investment. It does not matter whether the individual 
saver does or does not increase his cash hoIding. The act of saving 
always has its counterpart in a supply of goods produced and not 
consumed, of goods available for further production activities. A 
man's savings are always embodied in concrete capital goods. 

The idea that hoarded money is a barren part of the total amount 


Human Action 
of wealth the increase of which causes shrinkage in that part of 
wealth that is devoted to production is correct only to the extent that 
the rise in the monetary unit's purchasing power results in the em- 
ployment of additional factors of production for the mining of gold 
and in the transfer of gold from industrial to monetary employment. 
But this is brought about by the striving after increased cash holdings 
and not by saving. Saving, in the tnarket economy, is possibIe only 
through abstention from the consumption of a part of income. The 
individual saver's employment of his savings for hoarding influences 
the determination of money's purchasing power, and may thus reduce 
the nominal amount of capital, i.e., its money equivalent; it does not 
rendcr any part of the accumulated capital sterile. 


XIX. THE RATE OF INTEREST 
I. The Phenomenon of Interest 
IT 
every 
has been shown that time preference is a category inherent in 

human action. Time preference manifests itself in the 
phenomenon of originary interest, i.e., the discount of future goods 
as against present goods. 

Interest is not merely interest on capital. Interest is not the specific 
income derived from the utilization of capital goods. The corre-
spondence between three factors of production-labor, capital, and 
land-and three classes of income-wages, profit, and rent-as taught 
by the classical economists is untenable. Rent is not the specific 
revenue from land. Rent is a general catallactic phenomenon; it plays 
in the yield of labor and capital goods the same role it plays in the 
yield of land. Furthermore there is no homogcneous source of income 
that could be called profit in the sense in which the classical econo- 
mists applied this term. Profit (in the sense of entrepreneurial profit) 
and interest are no more characteristic of capital than they are of land. 

The prices of consumers' goods are by the interplay of the forces 
operating on the market apportioned to the various complementary 
factors cooperating in their production. As the consumers' goods are 
present goods, while the factors of production are means for the pro- 
duction of future goods, and as present goods are valued higher than 
future goods of the same kind and quantity, the sum thus apportioned, 
even in the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy, 
falls behind the present price of the consumers' goods concerned. 
This difference is the originary interest. It is not specifically con- 
nected with any of the three classes of factors of production which 
the classical economists distinguished. Entrepreneurial profit and loss 
are produced by changes in the data and the resulting price changes 
which occur in the passing of the period of production. 

Naive reasoning does not see any problem in the current revenue 
derived from hunting, fishing, cattle breeding, forestry, and agricul- 
ture. Nature generates deer, fish, and cattle and makes them grow, 
causes the cows to give milk and the chickens to lay eggs, the trees 
to put on wood and to bear fruit, and the seeds to shoot into ears. 


5*2 Human Action 

He who has a title to appropriate for himself this recurring wealth 
enjoys a steady income. Like a stream w-hich continualIy carries new 
water, the "strcam of income" flows continually and conveys again 
and again new wealth. The whole process is plainly a natural phenom- 
enon. But for thc economist a prohlem is presented in the determina- 
tion of prices for land, cattle, and all the rest. If future goods were 
not bought and sold at a discount as against present goods, the buyer 
of land would ham to pay a price which equals the sum of all future 
net revenues and which would leave nothing for a current reiterated 
income. 

The yearly recurring proceeds of the owners of land and cattle 
are not marked by any characteristic which would catallactically dis- 
tinguish them from the procecds stemming from produced factors of 
production which are used up sooner or later in the processes of pro- 
duction. The power of disposal over a piece of land is the control of 
this field's cooperation in the production of all the fruit which can 
ever be grown on it, and the power of disposal over a mine is the 
control of its cooperation in the extraction of all the minerals which 
can ever be brought to the surface from it. In the same way the own- 
ership of a machine or a hale of cotton is the control of its cooperation 
in thc manufacture of all goods which are produced with its coopera- 
tion. The fundamental fallacy implied in all the productivity and use 
approaches to the problem of interest was that they traced back the 
phcnomcnon of interest to these productive services rendered by the 
factors of production. However, the serviceableness of the factors of 
production determines the prices paid for them, not interest. These 
prices exhaust the whole difference between the productivity of a 
process aided by a definite factor's cooperation and that of a process 
lacking this cooperation. The djffercnce between the sum of the 
prices of the complen~entary factors of production and the products 
which emerges even in the absence of changes in the markct data 
concerned, is an outcome of the higher valuation of present goods as 
compared wih iumre goods. As production goes on, the factors of 
production arc transformed or ripen into present goods of a higher 
value. This increment is the source of specific proceeds flowing into 
the hands of the owncrs of thc factors of production, of originary 
interest. 

The owners of the material factors of production-as distinct from 
the pure entrepreneurs of the imaginary construction of an integra- 
tion of catallactic functions-harvest two catallactically different 
itcms: the prices paid for the productive cooperation of the factors 
they control on the one hand and interest on the other hand. These 


The Rate of Interest 

523 

two things must not be confused. It is not permissible to refer, in the 
explanation of interest, to the services rendered by the factors of pro- 
duction in the turning out of products. 

Intercst is a homogeneous phenomenon. There are no different 
sources of interest. Interest on durable goods and interest on consump- 
tion-credit are like other kinds of interest an outgrowth of the 
higher valuation of present goods as against future goods. 

2. Originary Interest 
Originary interest is the ratio of the value assigned to want-
satisfaction in the immediate future and the value assigned to want- 
satisfaction in remoter periods of the future. It manifests itself in the 
market economy in the discount of future goods as against present 
goods. It is a ratio of commodity prices, not a price in itself. There 
prevails a tendency toward the equalization of this ratio for a11 com- 
modities. In the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating econ- 
omy the rate of originary interest is the same for all commodities. 

Originary interest is not "the price paid for the services of capi- 
tal." The higher productivity of more time-consuming roundabout 
methods of production which is referred to by Bohm-Bawerk and 
by some later economists in the explanation of interest, does not ex- 
plain the phenomenon. It is, on the contrary, the phenomenon of 
originary interest that explains why lcss time-consuming methods of 
production are resorted to in spite of the fact that more time-
consuming methods would render a higher output per unit of input. 
Moreover, the phenomenon of originary interest explains why pieces 
of usable land can be sold and bought at finite prices. If the future 
services which a piece of land can render were to be vaIued in the 
same way in which its present services are valued, no finite price 
would be high enough to impel its owner to sell it. Land could 
ncithcr be bought nor sold against definite amounts of rnoncy, nor 
bartered against goods which can render only a finite number of 
services. Pieces of land would be bartered only against other pieces 
of land. A superstructure that can yield during a period of tcn years 
an annual revenue of one hundred dollars would be priced (gpart 
from the soil on which it is built) at the beginning of this period at 
one thousand dollars, at the beginning of the second year at nine 
hundred dollars, and so on. 

Originary interest is not a price determincd on the market by the 

I. This is the popular definition of interest as, for instance, given by EIy, 
Adams, Lorenz, and Young, Outlines of Economics (jd ed. New York, rgzo), 
p. 493-

Human Action 

interplay of the denland for and the suppIy of capital or capital 
goods. Its height docs not depend on the extent of this dcmand and 
supply. It is rather the rate of originary interest that determines both 
the demand for and the supply of capital and capital goods. It de- 
termines how much of the available supply of goods is to be devoted 
to consumption in the immediate future and how much to provision 
for remoter periods of the future. 

People do not save and accumulate capital because there is interest. 
Interest is neither the impetus to saving nor the reward or the com- 
pensation granted for abstaining from immediate consumption. It 
is the ratio in the mutual valuation of present goods as against future 
goods. 

The loan market does not determine the rate of interest. It adjusts 
the rate of interest on loans to the rate of originary interest as mani- 
fested in the discount of future goods. 

Originary interest is a category of human action. It is operative in 
any valuation of external things and can never disappear. If one day 
the state of affairs were to return which was actual at the close of the 
first millennium of the Christian era when people believed that the 
uItimate end of all earthly things mas impending, mcn would stop 
providing for future secular wants. The factors of production would 
in their eyes bccome useless and worthlcss. The discount of future 
goods as against present goods would not vanish. It would, on the 
contrary, increase beyond all measure. On the other hand, the fading 
away of originary interest would mean that people do not care at a11 
for want-satisfaction in nearer periods of the future. It would mean 
that they prefer to an apple available today, tomorrow, in one year 
or in ten years, two apples available in a thousand or ten thousand 
years. 

We cannot even think of a world in which originary interest would 
not exist as an inexorable element in every kind of action. Whether 
there is or is not division of labor and social cooperation and whether 
society is organized on the basis of private or of public control of 
the means of production, originary interest is always present. In a 
socialist commonwealth its role would not differ from that in the 
market economy. 

~iihrn-~awerk

has once for all unmasked the fallacies of the nai've 
productivjty explanations of interest, ie., of the idea that interest is 
the expression of the physical productivity of factors of production. 
However, Biihm-Bawcrk has himself based his own theory to some 
extent on the productivity approach. In referring in his explanation 
to the technological superiority of more time-consuming, roundabout 


The Rate of Internt 

processes of production, he avoids the crudity of the naive produc- 
tivity fallacies. But in fact he returns, although in a subtler form, 
to the productivity approach. Those later economists who, neglect- 
ing the tinie-preference idea, have stressed excIusively the produc- 
tivity idea contained in Bohm-Bawerk's theory cannot help con-
cluding that originary interest must disappear if men were one day 
to reach a state of affairs in which no further lengthening of the 
period of production could bring about a further increase in pro- 
ductivity."This is, however, utterly wrong. Originary interest can- 
not disappear as long as there is scarcity and therefore action. 

As long as the world is not transformed into a land of Cockaigne, 
men are faced with scarcity and must act and economize; they arc 
forced to choose between satisfaction in ncarcr and in remoter periods 
of the future because neither for the former nor for the latter can 
full contentment be attained. Then a change in the eznployment of 
factors of production which withdraws such factors from their em- 
ployment for want-satisfaction in the nearer future and devotes them 
to want-satisfaction in the remoter future must necessarily impair 
the state of satisfaction in the nearer future and improve it in the 
remoter future. If we were to assume that this is not the case, we 
should become embroiIed in insoiuble contradictions. We may at 
best think of a state of affairs in which technological knowledge and 
skill have reached a point beyond which no further progress is pos- 
sible for mortal men. No new processes increasing the output per unit 
of input can henceforth be invented. But if we suppose that some 
factors of production are scarce, we must not assunlc that all proc- 
esses which-apart from the timc they absorb-are the most pro- 
ductive ones are fully utilized, and that no process rendering a 
smaller output per unit of input is resorted to merely because of the 
fact that it produces its final result sooner than other, physically 
more productive processes. Scarcity of factors of production means 
that we are in a position to draft plans for the improvement of our 
well-being the realization of which is unfeasible because of the in- 
sufficient quantity of the means available. It is precisely the un-
feasibility of such desirable improvements that constitutes the ele- 
ment of scarcity. The reasoning of the modern supporters of the 
productivity approach is misled by the connotations of B6hm-
Bawerk's term roundabout method$ of production and the idea of 

2. Cf. Hayek, "The Mythology of Capital," The Quarterly Iournal of Eco-
nomics,L (igj6), 223 ff. Howcver Professor Hayek has since partly changed his 
point of view. (Cf. his article 'Time-Preference and Productivity, a Reconsidera-
tion," Economics, XI1 [ 19451, 22-25.) But the idea criticized in the text is still 
widely held by cconornists. 

Human Action 

technological improvement which it suggests. However, if there is 
scarcity, there must always be an unused technological opportunity 
to improve the state of well-being by a lengthening of the period 
of production in some branches of industry, regardless of whether or 
not the state of technological knowledge has changed. If the means 
are scarce, if the praxeological correlation of ends and means still 
exists, there are by logical necessity unsatisfied wants with regard 
both to nearer and to remoter periods of the future. There are always 
goods the procurement of which we must forego because the way that 
leads to their production is too long and would prevent us from 
satisfying more urgent needs. The fact that we do not provide more 
amply for the future is the outcome of a weighing of satisfaction 
in nearer periods of the future against satisfaction in remoter periods 
of the future. The ratio which is the outcome of this valuation is 
originary interest. 

In such a world of perfect technological knowledge a promoter 
drafts a plan A according to which a hotel in picturesque, but not 
easily accessible, mountain districts and the roads leading to it should 
be buiIt. In examining the practicability of this plan he discovers that 
the means available are not sufficient for its execution. Calculating 
the prospects of the profitability of the investment, he comes to the 
conclusion that the expected proceeds are not great enough to 
cover the costs of material and labor to be expended and interest 
on the capital to be invested. He renounces the execution of project 
A and embarks instead upon the realization of another plan, B. Ac-
cording to plan B the hotel is to be erected in a more easily accessible 
location which does not offer a11 the advantages of the picturesque 
landscape which plan A had selected, but in which it can be built 
either with lower costs of construction or finished in a shorter time. 
If no interest on the capital invested were to enter into the calcula- 
tion, the illusion could arise that the state of the market data-supply 
of capital goods and the valuations of the public-allows for the 
execution of plan A. However, the realization of plan A would with- 
draw scarce factors of production from employments in which they 
could satisfy wants considered more urgent by the consumers. It 
would mean a manifest malinvestment, a squandering of the means 
available. 

A lengthening of the period of production can increase the quan- 
tity of output per unit of input or produce goods which cannot be 
produced at all within a shorter period of production. But it is not 
true that the imputation of the value of this additional wealth to the 
capital goods required for the Iengthening of the period of produc- 


The Rate of Interest 

527 

tion generates interest. If one were to assume this, one would relapse 
into the crassest errors of the productivity approach, irrefutably ex- 
ploded by Bohm-Bawerlr. The contribution of the complementary 
factors of production to the result of the process is the reason for 
their being considered as valuable; it explains the prices paid for 
them and is fully taken into account in the determination of these 
prices. No residuum is left that is not accounted for and could explain 
interest. 

It has been asserted that in the imaginary construction of the 
evenly rotating economy no interest would appear.Wowever, it can 
be shown that this assertion is incompatible with the assu~nptions 
on which the construction of the evenly rotating economy is based. 

We begin with the distinction between two classes of saving: plain 
saving and capitalist saving. Plain saving is merely the piling up of 
consumers' goods for later consumption. Capitalist saving is the ac- 
cumulation of goods which are designed for an improvement of 
production processes. The aim of plain saving is later consumption; 
it is merely postponement of consumption. Sooner or later the goods 
accumula;ed will be consumed and nothing will be left. The aim of 
capitalist saving is first an improvement in the productivity of effort. 
It accumulates capital goods which are cmploped for further produc- 
tion and are not merely reserves for later consumption. The boon 
derived from plain saving is later consumption of the stock not in- 
stantly consumed but accumulated for later use. The boon derived 
from capitalist saving is the increase of the quantity of goods pro- 
duced or the production of goods which could not be produced at all 
without its aid. In constructing the image of an evcnly rotating 
(static) economy, economists disregard the process of capital ac-
cumulation; the capital goods are given and remain, as, according 
to the underlying assumptions, no changes occur in the data. There 
is neither accumulation of new capital through saving, nor consump- 
tion of capital availabIe through a surplus of consumption over in- 
come, k., current production minus the funds required for the 
maintcnance of capital. It is now our task to demonstrate that these 
assumptions are incompatible with the idea that there is no interest. 

There is no need to dwell, in this reasoning, upon plain saving. The 

objective of plain saving is to provide for a future in which the saver 

could possibly be less amply supplied than in the present. Yet, one of 

the fundamental assumptions characterizing the imaginary construc- 

tion of the evcnly rotating economy is that the future does not differ 

3. Cf. J. Schumpeter, The Theory of Econowzic Development, trans. by £2. 
Opie (Cambridge, 19341,pp. 34-46, 54. 

j28 Human Action 

at all from the present, that the actors are fully aware of this fact 
and act accordingly. Hence, in the frame of this construction, no 
room is left for the phenomenon of plain saving. 

It is different with the fruit of capitalist saving, the accumulated 
stock of capital goods. There is in the evenly rotating economy 
neither saving and accumulation of additional capital goods nor eat- 
ing up of already existing capita1 goods. Both phenomena would 
amount to a change in the data and would thus disturb the even 
rotation of the imaginary system. hTow, the magnitude of saving 
and capital accumulation in the past-i.e., in the period preceding 
the establishment of the evenly rotating economy-was adjusted to 
the height of the rate of interest. If-with the estabIishment of the 
conditions of the evenly rotating economy-the owners of the 
capital goods were no longer to receive any interest, the conditions 
which were operative in the allocation of the available stocks of 
goods to the satisfaction of wants in the various periods of the future 
would be upset. The altered state of affairs requires a new allocation. 
Also in the evenly rotating economy the difference in the valuation 
of want-satisfaction in various periods of the future cannot disappear. 
Also in the frame of this imaginary construction, people will assign 
a higher value to an apple available today as against an apple available 
in ten or a hundred years. If the capitalist no longer receives interest, 
the balance between satisfaction in nearer and remoter periods of 
the future is disarranged. The fact that a capitalist has maintained 
his capital at just ~oo,ooo dollars was conditioned by the fact that 
~oo,ooo present dollars were equal to 105,ooo dollars available twelve 
months later. These 5,000 dollars were in his eyes sufficient to out- 
weigh the advantages to be expected from an instantaneous con- 
sumption of a part of this sum. If interest payments are eliminated, 
capital consumption ensues. 

This is the essential deficiency of the static system as Schumpeter 
depicts it. It is not sufficient to assume that the capital equipment of 
such a system has been accumuiated in the past, that it is now avaii- 
able to the extent of this previous accumulation and is henceforth 
unalterably maintained at this level. We must also assign in the frame 
of this imaginary system a role to the operation of forces which bring 
about such a maintenance. If one eliminates the capitalist's role as 
receiver of interest, one replaces it by the capitalist's role as consumer 
of capital. There is no longer any reason why the owner of capital 
goods should abstain from employing them for consumption. Under 
the assumptions implied in the imaginary construction of static condi- 
tions (the evenly rotating economy) there is no need to keep them 


The Rate of Interest 

529 

in reserve for rainy days. But even if, inconsistently enough, we 
were to assume that a part of them is devoted to this purpose and 
therefore withheld from current consumption, at least that part of 
capital will be consumed which corresponds to the amount that 
capitalist saving exceeds plain saving.' 

If there were no originary interest, capital goods would not be 
devoted to in~mediate consumption and capital would not be con- 
sumed. On the contrary, under such an unthinkable and unimagi- 
nable state of affairs there would be no consumption at all, but only 
saving, accumulation of capital, and investment. Not the impossible 
disappearance of originary intercst, but the abolition of payment of 
interest to the owncrs of capital, would resuIt in capital consumption. 
The capitalists would consume their capital goods and their capita1 
preciseIy because there is originary interest and present want-satis- 
faction is preferred to later satisfaction. 

Therefore there cannot be any question of abolishing interest by 
any institutions, laws, and devices of bank manipulation. He who 
wants to "abolish" interest will have to induce people to value 
an apple available in a hundred years no less than a present apple. 
What can be abolished by laws and decrees is merely the right of 
the capitalists to receive interest. But such laws would bring about 
capital consumption and would very soon throw mankind back 
into the original state of natural poverty. 

3. The Height of Interest Rates 
In plain saving and in the capitalist saving of isolated economic 
actors the difference in thc valuation of want satisfaction in various 
p-iods of the future manifests itself in the extent to which people 
pavide in a more ample way for nearer than for remoter periods of 
the future. Under the conditions of a market economy the rate of 
originary intercst is, provided the assumptions involved in the imagi- 
nary construction of the evenly rotating economy are present, equal 
to the ratio of a definite amount of money available today and the 
amount availabk at a later date which is considered as its equivaknt. 

The ratc of originary interest directs the investment activities of 

the entrepreneurs. It determines the length of waiting time and of the 

period of production in every branch of industry. 

People often raise the question of which rate of interest, a "high" or 

a "low," stimulates saving and capital accumulation more and which 

4. Cf. Robbins, "On a Certain Ambiguity in the Conception of Stationary 
Equilibrium," The Economic Journal, XL (193o),21 I ff. 

Human Action 
less. The question makes no sense. The lower the discount attached 
to future goods is, the lower is the rate of originary interest. People 
do not save more because the rate of originary intcrcst rises, and the 
rate of originary interest does not drop on account of an increase in 
the amount of saving. Changes in the originary rates of interest and 
in the amount of saving are-other things, especially the institutional 
conditions, being equal-two aspects of the same phenomenon. The 
disappearance of originary interest would be tantamount to the dis- 
appearance of consumption. The increase of originary interest be- 
yond all measure would be tantamount to the disappearance of 
saving and any provision for the future. 
The quantity of the available supply of capital goods influences 
neither the rate of originary interest nor the amount of further saving. 
Even the most plentifuI supply of capital need not neccssarily bring 
about either a lowering of the rate of originary intcrcst or a drop in 
the propensity to save. The increase in capital accumulation and the 
per capita quota of capital invested which is a characteristic mark of 
economically advanced nations does not necessarily either lower the 
rate of originary interest or weaken the propensity of individuaIs to 
make additiona1 savings. PeopIe are, in dealing with these problems, 
for the most part misled by comparing merely the market rates of 
interest as they are determined on the loan market. However, these 
gross rates arc not merely expressive of the height of originary inter- 
est. They contain, as will be shown later, other elements besides, the 
effect of which accounts for the fact that the gross rates are as a rule 
higher in poorer countries than in richer ones. 
It is generally asserted that, other things being equal, the better 
individuals are supplied for the immediate future, the better they 
provide for wants for the rernotcr future. Consequently, it is said, 
the amount of total saving and capital accumulation wifhin an eco- 
nomic system depends on the arrangement of the population into 
groups of different income levels. In a society with approximate in- 
come equality there is, it is said, less saving than in a society in which 
there is more inequality. There is a gr.rain of truth in sudh obscrva- 
tions. However, they are statements about psychological facts and 
as such lack the universal validity and necessity inherent in prax- 
eological statements. Moreover, the other things the equality of which 
they presuppose comprehend the various individuals' valuations, their 
subjective value judgments in weighing the pros and cons of imme- 
diate consumption and of postponement of consumption. There are 
certainly many individuals whose behavior they describe correctly, 
but there also are other individuals who act in a different way. The 


The fire of Interest 531 

French peasants, although for the most part people of moderate 
wealth and income, were in the nineteenth century widely known 
for their parsimonious habits, while the wealthy members of the 
aristocracy and the heirs of huge fortunes amassed in commerce 
and industry were no Iess renowned for their profligacy. 

It is therefore impossible to formulate any praxeological theorem 
concerning the relation of the amount of capital available in the whole 
nation or to individual people on the one hand and the amount of 
saving or capital consumption and the height of the originary rate 
of interest on the other hand. The allocation of scarce resources to 
want satisfaction in various periods of the future is determined by 
value judgments and indirectly hy all those factors which constitute 
the individuality of the acting man. 

4. Originary Interest in the Changing Economy 
So far we have dealt with the problem of originary interest under 
certain assumptions: that the turnover of goods is effected by the 
employment of neutral money; that saving, capital accurnuiation, 
and the determination of interest rates are not hampered by institu- 
tionaI obstacles; and that the whole economic process goes on in the 
frame of an evenly rotating economy. We shall eliminate the first 
two of thcsc assumptions in the following chapter. Now we want to 
deal with originary interest in a changing economy. 

He who wants to provide for the satisfaction of future needs must 
correctly anticipate these needs. If he fails in this understanding of 
the future, his provision will prove less satisfactory or totalIy futile. 
There is no such thing as an abstract saving that could provide for 
all classes of want-satisfaction and would be neutral with regard to 
changes occurring in conditions and valuations. Originary interest can 
therefore in the changing economy never appear in a pure unalloyed 
form. It is only in the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating 
economy that the mere passing of time matures originary interest; in 
the passage of time and with the progress of the process of production 
Inore and more value accrues, as it were, to the complementary 
factors of production; with the termination of the process of produc- 
tion the lapse of time has generated in the price of the product the 
full quota of originary interest. In the changing economy during the 
period of production there also arise synchronously other changes 
in valuations. Some goods are valued higher than previously, some 
lower. These alterations are the source from which entrepreneurial 
profits and losses stem. Only those entrepreneurs who in their planning 


Human Action 

have correctly anticipated the future state of the market are in a 
position to reap, in selling the products, an excess over the costs of 
prod~~ction

(inclusive of net originary interest) expended. An entre- 
prcneur who has failed in his speculative understanding of the future 
can sell his products, if at all, only at prices which do not cover com- 
pletcly his expenditures plus originary interest on the capital invested. 

Like entrepreneurial profit and loss, intcrcst is not a price, but a 
magnitude which is to be disengaged by a particular mode of com- 
putation from the price of the products of successful business opera- 
tions. Thc gross difference between the price at which a commodity 
is sold and the costs expended in its production (exclusive of interest 
on the capital invested) was called profit in the terminology of 
British classical economics."Jodern economics conceives this magni- 
tude as a complex of catallactically disparate items. The excess of 
gross receipts over expenditures which the classical economists called 
profit includes the price for the entrepreneur's own labor employed 
in the process of production, interest on the capital invested, and 
finally entrepreneurial profit proper. If such an excess has not been 
reaped at all in the sale of the products, the cntrepreneur not only fails 
to get profit proper, he receives neither an equivalent for the market 
value of the labor hc has contributed nor interest on the capital in- 
vested. 

The breaking down of gross profit (in the classical sense of the 
term) into managerial wages, interest, and entrepreneurial profit is 
not merely a device of economic theory. It devcloped, with progress- 
ing perfection in business practices of accountancy and calculation, 
in the field of commercial routine independently of the reasoning 
of the economists. The judicious and sensible businessman does not 
attach practical significance to the confused and garbled concept of 
profit as employed by the classical economists. His notion of costs of 
production includes the potcntial market price of his own services 
contributed, the interest paid on capital borrow-ed, and the potential 
interest hc could earn, according to the conditions of the market, on 
his own capital invested in the enterprise by lending it to other people. 
Only the excess of proceeds over the costs so calculated is in his 
eyes entrepreneuria1 pr~fit.~

6. But, of course, the present-day intentional confusion of all economic con- 
cepts is conducive to obscuring this distinction. Thus, in the United States, in 
dealing with thc dividends paid by corporations people speak of "profits." 

The Rate of Interest 

the other items included in the profit concept of classical economics 
presents no particular problem. It is more difficult to sunder entre- 
preneurial profit from originary interest. In the changing economy 
interest stipulated in loan contracts is always a gross magnitude out 
of which the pure rate of originary interest must be computed by a 
particular process of computation and analytical repartition. It has 
been shown already that in every act of lending, even apart from 
the probIem of changes in the monetary unit's purchasing power, 
there is an element of entrepreneurial venture. The granting of 
credit is necessarily always an entrepreneurial speculation which 
can possibly result in failure and the loss of a part or of the total 
amount lent. Every interest stipulated and paid in loans includes not 
only originary interest but also entrepreneurial profit. 

This fact for a long time misled the attempts to construct a satis- 
factory theory of interest. It was only the elaboration of the imagi- 
nary construction of the evenly rotating economy that made it possible 
to distinguish precisely between originary interest and entrepre- 
neuriaI profit and loss. 

5. The Computation of Interest 
Originary interest is the outgrowth of valuations unceasingly 
fluctuating and changing. It fluctuates and changes with them. The 
custom of computing interest pro anno is merely commercial usage 
and a convenient rule of reckoning. It does not affect the height of 
the interest rates as determined by the market. 

The activities of the entrepreneurs tend toward the establishment 

of a uniform rate of originary interest in the whole market economy. 

If there turns up in one sector of the market a margin between the 

prices of present goods and those of future goods which deviates from 

the margin prevailing in other sectors, a trend toward equalization 

is brought about by the striving of businessmen to enter those sectors 

in which this margin is higher and to avoid those in which it is lower. 

The finaI rate of originary interest is the same in all parts of the 

market of the evenly rotating economy. 

The valuations resulting in the emergence of originary interest 

prefer satisfaction in a nearer period of the future to satisfaction of 

the same kind and extent in a remoter period of the future. Nothing 

would justify the assun~ption that this discounting of satisfaction in 

remoter periods progresses continuousIy and evenly. If we were to 

assume this, we would imply that the period of provision is infinite. 

However, the mere fact that individuals differ in their provision 


5 34 Human Action 

for future needs and that even to the most provident actor provision 
beyond a definite period appears supererogatory, forbids us to think 
of the period of provision as infinite. 

The usages of the loan market must not mislead us. It is customary 
to stipulate a uniform rate of interest for the whole duration of a 
loan contract and to apply a uniform rate in computing compound 
interest. Thc real determination of intcrest rates is independent of 
these and other arithmetical devices of interest computation. If the 
rate of interest is unaltcrably fixed by contract for a period of time, 
intcrvening changes in the market rate of interest are reflected in 
corresponding changes in the prices paid for the principal, due 
allowance being rnadc for the fact that the amount of principal to be 
paid back at thc maturity of the loan is unalterably stipulated. It 
does not affect the result whether one calculates with an unchanging 
rate of intercst and changing- prices of the principal or with changing 
intercst rates and an unchanging amount of the principal, or with 
changes in both magnitudes. 

The terms of a loan contract arc not independent of the stipulated 
duration of thc loan. Kot only because those components of the 
gross rate of market interest which made it deviate from the rate of 
originary interest are affected by differences in the duration of the 
loan, but also on account of factors which bring about changes in the 
rate of originary interest, loan contracts are valued and appraised 
differently according to the duration of the loan stipulated. 

7. There are, of course, also deviations from this usage. 

XX.INTEREST, CREDIT EXPANSION, 
AND THE TRADE CYCLE 

I. The Problems 
1N 
are performed by the intermediary of money, the category of 
the market economy in which all acts of interpersonal exchange 

originary interest manifests itself primarily in the interest on money 
loans. 

It has been pointed out already that in the imaginary construction 
of the evenly rotating economy, the rate of originary interest is 
uniform. There prevails in the whole system only one rate of inter- 
est. The rate of interest on loans coincides with the rate of originary 
interest as manifested in the ratio between prices of present and of 
future goods. We may call this rate the neutral rate of interest. 

The evenly rotating economy presupposes neutral money. As 
money can never be neutral, special problems arise. 

If the money relation-i.e., the ratio between the demand for and 
the supply of money for cash holding-changes, all prices of goods 
and services are affected. These changes, however, do not affect the 
prices of the various goods and services at the same time and to the 
same extent. The resulting modifications in the wealth and income 
of various individuals can also alter the data determining the height 
of originary interest. The final state of the rate of originary interest 
to the establishment of which the system tends after the appearance 
of changes in the money relation, is no longer that final state toward

power to bring about lasting changes in the final rate of originary in- 
terest and neutral interest. 

Then there is a second, even more momentous, problem which, 
of course, may also be looked upon as another aspect of the same 
problem. Changes in the money relation may under certain circum- 
stances first affect the loan market in which the demand for and sup- 
ply of loans influences the market rate of interest on loans, which we 
may call the gross money (or market) rate of interest. Can such 
changes in the gross money rate cause the net rate of interest included 


Human Action 

in it to deviate lastingly from the height which corresponds to the 
rate of originary intercst, i.e., the difference between the valuation 
of present and futurc goods? Can events on the loan market partialIy 
or totally eliminate originary interest? No economist will hesitate to 
answer thcse questions in the negative. But then a further problem 
arises: How docs the interplay of the market factors readjust the 
gross money rate to the height conditioned by the rate of originary 
interest? 

These are great problems. These were the problems economists 
tricd to solve in discussing banking, fiduciary media and circulation 
credit, credit cxpansion, gratuitousness or nongratuitousness of credit, 
the cyclical movements of trade, and all other problems of indirect 
exchange. 

2. The Entreprcneurial Component in the Gross 
Market Rate of Interest 
The market rates of interest on loans arc not pure interest rates. 
Among the components contributing to their determination there 
are also elements which are not interest. The moneylender is always 
an entrepreneur. Every grant of credit is a speculative entrepreneurial 
venture, the success or failure of which is uncertain. The lender is 
always faced with the possibility that he may lose a part or the whole 
of the principal lent. His appraisal of this danger determines his 
conduct in bargaining with the prospective debtor about the terms of 
the contract. 

There can never be perfect safety either in moneylending or in 

other classes of credit transactions and deferred payments. Debtors, 

guarantors, and warrantors may become insolvent, collateral and 

mortgages may become worthless. The creditor is always a 

virtual partner of the debtor or a virtual owner of the pledged and 

mortgaged property. He can be affected by changes in the market 

data concerning them. He has linked his fate with that of the debtor 

or with the changes occurring in the price of the collateral. Capital 

as such does not bear interest; it must be well employed and invested 

not only in order to yield interest, but also lest it disappear entirely. 

The dictum pecunia pecuniawz parere non potest (money cannot 

beget money) is rncaningful in this sense, which, of course, differs 

radically fro~n the sense which ancient and medieval philosophers 

attached to it. Gross interest can be reaped only by creditors who 

have been successful in thcir lending. If they earn any net interest 

at all, it is included in a yield which contains more than merely net 


Intewst, Credit E.xpamion, the Trade Cycle 5 3 7 

interest. Net intcrcst is a magnitude which only analytical thinking 
can extract from the gross proceeds of the creditor. 

The entrepreneurial component included in the creditor's goss 
proceeds is determined by all those factors which are operative in 
every entrepreneurial venture. It is, moreover, codetermined by the 
legal and institutional setting. The contracts which place the debtor 
and his fortune or the collateral as a buffer betwecn the creditor and 
the disastrous consequences of maIinvestmcnt of the capital lent, 
arc conditioned bv laws and institutions. The creditor is less exposcd 
to loss and failure'than the debtor only in so far as this legal and insti- 
tutional framcwork makes it possiblc for him to enforce his claims 
against refractory debtors. Thcrc is, however, no need for economics 
to enter into a dctailed scrutiny of thc legal aspects involved in bonds 
and debentures, preferred stock, mortgages, and other kinds of credit 
transactions. 

The entrepreneurial component is present in all species of loans. 
It is customary to distinguish bctween consumption or personal loans 
on the one hand, and productive or business loans on the other. The 
characteristic mark of the formcr class is that it enables the borrorver 
to spend expected future proceeds. In acquiring a claim to a share in 
these future proceeds, the lender becomes an entrepreneur, as in 
acquiring a claim to a share in the futurc proceeds of a business. The 
particular uncertainty of the outcome of his lending consists in the 
uncertainty about these future proceeds. 

It is furthermore customary to distinguish between private and 
public loans, ie., loans to governments and subdivisions of govern- 
ments. The particular uncertainty inherent in such loans concerns 
the life of secuIar power. Enlpires may crumble and governments 
may bc overthrown by revolutionaries who are not prepared to as- 
sume responsibility for the clcbts contracted by their predecessors. 
That thcre is, besides, something basically vicious in all kinds of 
long-term government debts, has been pointed out a1ready.l 

Over all species of deferred payments hangs, like a sword of 
DarnocIcs, the danger of government interference. Public opinion 
has always heen biased against creditors. It identifies creditors with 
the idle rich and debtors with the industrious poor. It abhors the 
former as ruthless esploitcrs and pities the latter as innocent victims 
of oppression. It considers government action designed to curtail the 
claims of the creditors as measures extremcly beneficial to the im- 
mcnsc majority at the expense of a small minority of hardboiled 
usurers. It did not notice at all that nineteentb-century capitalist in- 

I. Cf. above, pp. 227-229. 

Human Action 

novations have wholly changed the composition of the classes of 
creditors and debtors. In the days of Solon the Athenian, of ancient 
Rome's agrarian laws, and of the Middle Ages, the creditors were by 
and large the rich and the debtors the poor. But in this age of bonds 
and debentures, mortgage banks, savings banks, life insurance policies, 
and social security benefits, the masses of people with more moderate 
income are rather themselves creditors. On the other hand, the rich, 
in their capacity as owners of common stock, of plants, farms, and 
real estate, are more often debtors than creditors. In asking for the 
expropriation of creditors, the masses are unwittingly attacking their 
own particular interests. 

With public opinion in this state, the creditor's unfavorable chance 
of being harmed by anticreditor measures is not balanced by a 
favorable chance of being privileged by antidebtor measures. This 
unbalance would bring about a unilateral tendency toward a rise 
of the entrepreneurial component contained in the gross rate of 
interest if the political danger were limited to the loan market, and 
would not in the same way affect today all kinds of private owner- 
ship of the means of production. As things are in our day, no kind of 
investment is safe against the political dangers of a general expropria- 
tion of all private property. A capitalist cannot reduce the vulner- 
ability of his weaIth by p;eferring direct investment in business to 
lending his capital to business or to the government. 

The political risks involved in moneylending do not affect the 
height of originary interest; they affect the entrepreneurial compo- 
nent included in the gross market rate. In the limiting case-i.e., in a 
situation in which the impending nullification of all contracts con- 
cerning deferred payments is generally expected-they would cause 
the entrepreneurial component to increase beyond all meas~re.~ 

3. The Price Premium as a Component of the Gross 
Market Rate of Interest 
Money is neutral if the cash-induced changes in the monetary unit's 
purchasing power affect at the same time and to the same extent 
the prices of all commodities and services. With neutral money, a 
neutral rate of interest would be conceivable, provided there were 
no deferred payments. If there were deferred payments and if we 

2. The difference between this case (case b) and the case of the expected end 
rif all earthly things dealt with on p. 524 (case a) is this: in case a originary 
interest increases beyond all measure because future goods become entirely 
worthless; in case b originary interest does not change while the entrepreneurial 
component increase beyond all measure. 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 539 

disregard the entrepreneurial position of the creditor and the ensuing 
entrepreneurial component in the gross rate of interest, we must 
furthermore assume that the eventuality of future changes in purchas- 
ing power is taken into account in stipulating the terms of the con- 
tract. The principal is to be multiplied periodically by the index 
number and thus to be increased or decreased in accordance with the 
changes that have come to pass in purchasing power. With the ad- 
j ustment of the principal, the amount from which the rate of interest 
is to be calculated changes too. Thus, this rate is a neutral rate of in- 
terest. 

With neutral money, neutralization of the rate of interest could 
also be attained by another stipulation, provided the parties are in a 
position to anticipate correctly the future changes in purchasing 
power. They could stipulate a gross rate of interest containing an 
allowance for such changes, a percentile addendum to, or subtra- 
hendum from, the rate of originary interest. We may call this allow- 
ance the-positive or negative-price premium. In the case of a 
quickly progressing deflation, the negative price premium could not 
only swallow the whole rate of originary interest, but even reverse 
the gross rate into a minus quantity, a rate to be passed on the debtor's 
account. If the price premium is correctly calculated, neither the 
creditor's nor the debtor's position is affected by intervening changes 
in purchasing power. The rate of interest is neutral. 

However, all these assumptions are not only imaginary, they cannot 
even hypothetically be thought of without contradictions. In the 
changing economy, the rate of interest can never be neutral. In the 
changing economy, there is no uniform rate of originary interest; 
there only prevails a tendency toward the establishment of such mi- 
formity. Before the final state of originary interest is attained, new 
changes in the data emerge which divert anew the movement of in- 
terest rates toward a new final state. Whcre everything is unceasingly 
in flux, no neutral rate of interest can be established. 

In the world of reality all prices are fluctuating and acting men are 
forced to take full account of these changes. Entrepreneurs embark 
upon business ventures and capitalists change their investments only 
because they anticipate such changes and want to profit from the&. 
The market economy is essentially characterized as a social systcm 
in which there prevails an incessant urge toward improvement. The 
most provident and enterprising individuals are driven to earn profit 
by readjusting again and again the arrangement of production activi- 
ties so as to fill in the best possible way the needs of the consumers, 
both those needs of which the consumers themselvcs are already 


aware and those latent needs of the satisfaction of which they have 
not yet thought thcmselves. These speculative ventures of the pro- 
moters revolutionize afresh each day the structure of prices and 
thereby also the height of the gross market rate of interest. 

He who expects a risc in certain prices enters the loan market as a 
borrower and is ready to allow a higher gross rate of interest than he 
would allow if he were to expect a less momentous rise in prices or 
no risc at all. On the other hand, the lender, if he himself expects a 
rise in prices, grants Ioans only if the gross rate is higher than it would 
be under a state of the market in which less momentous or no upward 
changes in prices are anticipated. The borrower is not deterred by a 
higher rate if his project seems to offer such good chances that it can 
afford higher costs. The lender would abstain from lending and would 
himself enter the market as an cntrcpreneur and bidder for commodi- 
ties and services if the gross rate of interest were not to compensate 
him for the profits he could reap this way. The expectation of rising 
prices thus has thc tendency to make the gross rate of interest rise, 
while the expectation of dropping prices makes it drop. If the ex- 
pected changes in the price structure concern only a limited group 
of commodities and services, and are counterbalanced by the expecta- 
tion of an opposite change in the prices of other goods, as is the case 
in the absence of changes in the money relation, the two opposite 
trends by and large counterpoise each other. But if the money relation 
is sensibly altered and a general rise or fall in the prices of all com- 
modities and services is expected, one tendency carries on. A positive 
or negative price premium emerges in all deals concerning deferred 
payments.' 

The role of the price premium in the changing economy is dif- 
ferent from that we ascribed to it in the hypothetical and unrealizable 
scheme developed above. It can never entircly remove, even as far 
as credit operations alone are concerned, the effects of changes in the 
money relation; it can never make interest rates neutral. It cannot 
alter the fact that money is essentially equipped with a driving force 
of its own. Even if all actors were to know correctly and completely 
the quantitative data concerning the changes in the supply of money 
(in the broader sense) in the whole economic system, the dates on 
which such changes were to occur and what individuals were to be 
first affected by them, they would not be in a position to know be- 
forehand whether and to what extent the demand for money for cash 
holding would change and in what temporal sequence and to what 
extent the prices of the various commodities would change. The 

3. Cf. Irving Fisher, The Rate of Interest (New York, 19071, pp. 77 ff. 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 541 

price premium could counterpoise the effects of changes in the money 
relation upon the substantial importance and the economic signifi- 
cance of crcdit contracts only if its appearance were to precede the 
occurrence of the price changes generated by the alteration in the 
money relation. It would have to be the rcsult of a reasoning by virtue 
of which the actors try to compute in advance the date and the extent 
of such price changes with regard to all commodities and services 
which dircctly or indirectly count for their own state of satisfaction. 
However, such computations cannot be established because their 
performance would require a perfect knowledge of future conditions 

and valuations. 

?he emergence of the price premium is not the product of an 
arithmetical operation which could provide reliable knowledge and 
eliminate the uncertainty concerning the future. It is the outcome 
of the promoters' understanding of the future and their calculations 
based on such an understanding. It comes into existencc step by step 
as soon as first a few and then successively more and more actors be- 
come aware of the fact that the market is faced with cash-induced 
changes in the money relation and consequently with a trend oriented 
in a definite direction. Only when people begin to buy or to sell in 
order to take advantage of this trend, does the price premium come 
into existence. 

It is necessary to realize that the price premium is the outgrowth 

of speculations having regard for anticipated changes in the money 

relation. What induces it, in the case of the expectation that an in- 

flationary trend will keep on going, is already the first sign of that 

phenomenon which later, when it becomes general, is called "flight 

into real values" and finally produces the crack-up boom and the 

crash of thc monetary system concerned. As in every case of the 

understanding of future hevelopments, it is possible that the specu-

lators may err, that the inff ationary or deflationary movement will be 

stopped or slowed down, and that prices will differ from what they 

expected. 

The increased propensity to buy or to sell, which generates the 

price premium, affects as a rule short-term loans sooner and to a 

greater extent than long-term loans. As far as this is the case, the price 

premium affects the market for short-term loans first, and only later, 

by virtue of the concatenation of all parts of the market, also the 

market for long-term loans. However, there are instances in which 

a price premium in long-term loans appears independently of what 

is going on with regard to short-term loans. This was especialIy the 

case in international lending in the days in which there was still a 


Human Action 

live international capital market. It happened occasionally that lenders 
were confident with regard to the short-term deveIopment of a 
foreign country's national currency; in short-term loans stipulated 
in this currency there was no price premium at all or only a slight 
one. But the appraisal of the long-term aspects of the currency con- 
cerned was less favorable, and in long-term contracts a considerable 
price premium was taken into account. The result was that long-term 
loans stipulated in this currency could be floated only at a higher rate 
than the same debtor's loans stipulated in terms of gold or a foreign 
currency. 

We have shown one reason why the price premium can at best 
practically deaden, but never eliminate entirely, the repercussions of 
cash-induced changes in the money relation upon the content of 
credit transactions. (A second reason will be dealt with in the next 
section.) The price premium always lags behind the changes in pur- 
chasing power because what generates it is not the change in the sup- 
ply of money (in the broader sense), but the-necessarily later-
occurring-effects of these changes upon the price structure. Only 
in the final state of a ceaseless inflation do things become different. 
The panic of the currency catastrophe, the crack-up boom, is not 
only characterized by a tendency for prices to rise beyond all meas- 
ure, but also by a rise beyond ail measure of the positive price pre- 
mium. hTo gross rate of interest, however great, appears to a prospec- 
tive lender high enough to compensate for the losses expected from 
the progressing drop in the monetary unit's purchasing power. He 
abstains from lending and prefers to buy himself "real" goods. The 
loan market comes to a standstill. 

4. The Loan Market 
The gross rates of interest as determined on the loan market are 
not uniform. The entrepreneurial component which they always in- 
ciude varies according to the pecuiiar characteristics of the specific 
deal. It is one of the most serious shortcomings of all historical and 
statistical studies devoted to the movement of interest rates that they 
neglect this factor. It is useless to arrange data concerning interest 
rates of the open ~narket or the discount rates of the central banks in 
time series. The various data available for the construction of such 
time series are incommensurable. The same central bank's rate of 
discount meant something different in various periods of time. The 
institutional conditions affecting the activities of various nations' 
central banks, their private banks, and their organized loan markets 


Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 543 

are so different, that it is entirely misleading to compare the nominal 
interest rates without paying full regard to these diversities. We know 
a priori that, other things being equal, the lenders are intent upon 
preferring high interest rates to low ones, and the debtors upon pre- 
ferring low rates to high ones. But these other things are never equal. 
There prevails upon the loan market a tendency toward the equaliza- 
tion of gross interest rates for loans for which the factors determining 
the height of the entrepreneurial component and the price premium 
are equal. This knowledge provides a mental tool for the interpreta- 
tion of the facts concerning the history of interest rates. Without 
the aid of this knowledge, the vast historical and statistical material 
available would be merely an accumulation of meaningless figures. 
In arranging time series of the prices of certain primary commodities, 
empiricism has at least an apparent justification in the fact that the 
price data dealt with refer to the same physical object. It is a spurious 
excuse indeed as prices are not related to the unchanging physical 
properties of things, but to the changing values which acting men 
attach to them. But in the study of interest rates, even this lame ex- 
cuse cannot be advanced. Gross interest rates as they appear in reality 
have nothing else in common than those characteristics which catal- 
lactic theory sees in them. They are complex phenomena and can 
never be used for the construction of an empirical or a posteriori 
theory of interest. They can neither verify nor falsify what economics 
teachis about the problems involved. They constitute, if carefully 
analyzed with all the knowledge economics conveys, invaluable docu- 
mentation for economic history; they are of no avail for economic 
theory. 

It is customary to distinguish the market for short-term loans 
(money market) from the market for long-term loans (capital mar- 
ket). A more penetrating analysis must even go further in classifying 
loans according to their duration. Besides, there are differences with 
regard to the legal characteristics which the terms of the contract 
assign to the iender's ciaim. in short, the ioan market is not homo- 
geneous. But the most conspicuous differences arise from the entre- 
preneurial component included in the gross rates of interest. It is 
this that people refer to when asserting that credit is based on trust or 
confidence. 

The connexity between all sectors of the loan market and the 
gross rates of interest determined on them is brought about by the 
inherent tendency of the net rates of interest included in these gross 
rates toward the final state of originary interest. With regard to this 
tendency, catallactic theory is free td deal with the market rate of 


Human Action 

interest as if it were a uniform phenomenon, and to abstract from the 
cntrcpreneurial component which is necessarily always included in 
the gross rates and from the price premium which is occasionally in- 
cluded. 

The prices of all commodities and services are at any instant moving 
toward a final state. If this final state were ever to be reached, it 
would show in the ratio between the prices of present goods and 
future goods the final state of originary interest. However, the chang- 
ing economy never reaches the imaginary final state. Sew data 
emerge again and again and divert the trend of prices from the pre- 
vious goal of their movement toward a different final state to which 
a different rate of originary interest may correspond. In the rate of 
originary interest there is no more permanence than in prices and 
wage rates. 

TThose people whose provident action is intent upon adjusting 
the employment of thc factors of production to the changes occurring 
in the data-viz., the entrepreneurs and promoters-base their cal- 
culations upon the prices, wage rates, and interest rates as deter- 
mined on the market. They discover discrepancies between the 
present prices of the complementary factors of production and the 
anticipated prices of the products minus the market rate of interest, 
and are eager to profit from them. The role which the rate of interest 
plays in these deliberations of the planning businessman is obvious. 
It shows him how far lie can go in withholding factors of production 
from employment for want-satisfaction in nearer periods of the future 
and in dedicating them to want satisfaction in remoter periods. It 
shows him what period of production conforms in every concrete 
case to the difference which the public makes in the ratio of valuation 
between present goods and future goods. It prevents him from em- 
barking upon projects the execution of which would not agree with 
the limited amount of capital goods provided by the saving of the 
public. 

It is in influencing this primordial function of the rate of interest 
that the driving force of money can become operative in a particular 
way. Cash-induced changes in the money relation can under certain 
circumstances affect the loan market before they affect the prices 
of commodities and of labor. The increase or decrcase in the supply 
of money (in the broader sense) can increase or decrease the supply 
of money offered on the loan market and thereby lower or raise the 
gross market rate of interest although no change in the rate of original 
interest has taken place. If this happens, the market rate deviates from 
the height which the state of originary interest and the supply of 


Interest, Credit Expansio~~, 545

the Trade Cycle 

capital goods available for production would require. Then the 
market rate of interest fails to fulfill the function it plays in guiding 
entrepreneurial decisions. It frustrates the entrepreneur's calculation 
and diverts his actions from those lines in which they would in the 
best possible way satisfy the most urgent needs of the consumers. 

Then there is a second important fact to realize. If, other things 
being equal, the supply of money (in the broader sense) increases 
or decreases and thus brings about a general tendency for prices to 
rise or to drop, a positive or negative price prcmium would have to 
appear and to raisc or lower the gross rate of market interest. But 
if such changes in the money relation affect first the loan market, 
they bring about just the opposite changes in the configuration of 
the gross market rates of interest. While a positive or negative price 
premium would be required to adjust the market rates of interest to 
the changes in the money relation, gross interest rates are in fact 
dropping or rising. 'This is the second reason why the instrumentality 
of the price premium cannot entirely eliminate the repercussions of 
cash-induced changes in the money relation upon the content of con- 
tracts concerning deferred payments. Its operation begins too late, it 
lags behind the changes in purchasing power, as has been shown above. 
Now we see that under certain circumstances the forces that push in 
the opposite direction manifest themselves sooner on the market than 
the price premium. 

5. The Effects of Changes in the Money Relation 
Upon Originary Interest 
Like every change in the market data, changes in the money rela- 
tion can possibly influence the rate of originary interest. -4ccording 
to the inflationist view of history, inflation by and large tends to 
increase the earnings of the entrepreneurs. Commodity prices rise 
sooner and to a steeper level than wage rates. On the one hand, wage 
earners and salaried peopie, ciasses who spend the greater part of 
their income for consumption and save little, are adversely affected 
and must accordingly restrict their expenditures. On the other hand, 
the proprietary strata of the population, whose propensity to save 
a considerable part of their income is much greater, are favored; they 
do not increase their consumption in proportion, but also increase 
their savings. Thus in the community as a whole there arises a tendency 
toxvard an intensified accumulation of new capital. Additional in- 
vestment is the corollary of the restriction of consumption imposed 
upon that part of the population which consumes the much greater 


Human Action 
part of the annual produce of the economic system. This forced 
saving lowers the rate of originary interest. It accclcrates the pace of 
economic progress and the improvement in technological methods. 
It is important to realize that such forced saving can originate from 
an inflationary movement and actually often did so originate in the 
past. In dealing with the effects of changes in the money relation upon 
the height of interest rates, one must not neglect the fact that such 
changes can under certain circumstances rcally alter the rate of 
originary interest. But several other facts must be taken into account, 
too. 
First one must realize that forced saving can result from inflation, 
but need not necessarily. It depends on thc particular data of each 
instance of inflation whether or not the rise in wage ratcs lags behind 
the rise in commodity prices. A tendency for real wage rates to drop 
is not an inescapable consequence of a decline in the monetary unit's 
purchasing power. It could happen that nominal wage rates rise 
more than or sooner than commodity pricesn4 
Furthermore, it is necessary to remember that the greater propen- 
sity of the wealthier classes to save and to accumulate capital is merely 
a psychological and not a praxeological fact. It could happen that 
these pcople to whom the inflationary movcrnent conveys additional 
proceeds do not save and invest their boon but employ it for an in- 
crease in their consumption. It is impossible to predict with the 
apodictic definiteness which characterizes all theorems of economics, 
in what way those profiting from the inflation will act. History can 
tell us what happened in the past. But it cannot assert that it must 
happen in the future. 
It w-ould be 3 serious blunder to neglect the fact that inflation also 
generates forces which tend toward capital consumption. One of its 
consequences is that it falsifies cconomic calculation and accounting. 
It produces the phenomenon of imaginary or apparent profits. If the 
annual depreciation quotas are determined in such a way as not to 
pay full regard to the fact that the replacement of worn-out equip- 
ment will require higher costs than the amount for which it was pur- 
chased in the past, they are obviously insufficient. If in selling inven- 
tories and products the whole difference bctween the price spent for 
their acquisition and the price realized in the sale is entered in the 
books as a surplus, the error is the same. If the rise in the prices of 
stocks and real estate is considered as a gain, the illusion is no less 
manifest. What makes people believe that inflation results in general 

4. We are dealing here with conditions on an unhampered labor market. About 
the argument advanced by Lord Keynes, see below, pp. 771 and 786-787. 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 547 

prosperity is prccisely such illusory gains. They feel lucky and be- 
come openhanded in spending and enjoying life. They embellish 
their homcs, they build new mansions and patronize the cntertain- 
ment business. In spending apparent gains, the fanciful result of false 
reckoning, they are consun~ing capital. It does not matter who these 
spenders are. They may be businessmen or stock jobbers. Thcy may 
bc wage earncrs whose demand for higher pay is satisfied by the 
easygoing employers who think that they are getting richer from 
day to day. They may be people supported by taxes which usually 
absorb a great part of thc apparent gains. 

Finally, with the progress of inflation more and morc peoplc be- 
come aware of the fall in purchasing power. For those not personally 
engaged in busincss and not familiar with the conditions of the 
stock market, thc main vehicle of saving is the accumulation of savings 
deposits, the purchase of bonds and life insurance. All such savings 
are prejudiccd by inflation. Thus saving is discouraged and extrava- 
gance sccms to he indicated. The ultimate reaction of the public, the 
"flight into real values," is a desperate attempt to salvage some debris 
from the ruinous breakdown. It is, viewed from the angle of capital 
prescrvation, not a remedy, but merely a poor emergency measure. 
It can, at best. rescue a fraction of the saver's funds. 

The main thesis of thc champions of inflationism and cxpansionism 
is thus rather weak. It may be admitted that in the past inflation often, 
but not always, resuIted in forced saving and an increase in capital 
available. However, this does not mean that it must produce the 
same effects in the futurc, too. On the contrary, one must rcalize 
that under modcrn conditions the forces driving toward capital con- 
sumption are more likely to prevail under inflationary conditions 
than those driving toward capital accumulation. At any rate, the 
final effect of such changes upon saving, capital. and the originary 
rate of intcrcst depends upon the particulzr data of each instance. 

The same is valid with the necessary changes with regard to the 

analogous conscquences and effccts of' a deflationist or restrictionist 

movement. 

6. The Gross Market Ratc of Interest as- Affected by 
Inflation and Credit Expansion 
Whatcver the ultimate effects of an inflationary or deflationary 
movement upon the height of the rate of originarv interest mav be, 
therc is no correspondence between them and the'tcmporary altera- 
tions which a cash-induced change in the money relation can bring 


54s Human Action 
about in the gross market rate of interest. If the inflow of money and 
money-substitutes into the market system or the outflow from it 
affects the loan market first, jt remporarily disarranges the congruity 
between the gross market rates of intercst and the rate of originary 
intercst. The market rate rises or drops on account of thc decrease or 
increase in the amount of money offcred for lending, with no correla- 
tion to changes in the originary rate of interest which in the later 
course of events can possibly occur from thc changes in the money 
relation. The market rate deviates from the height dctermincd by 
that of the originary ratc of interest, and forces come into operation 
which tend to adjust it anew to the ratio which corresponds to that 
of originary interest. It may happen that in the period of time which 
this adjustment requires, the height of originary intcrcst varies, and 
this change can also be caused by the inflationary or deflationary proc- 
ess which brought about the deviation. Then the final ratc of origi- 
nary interest determining the final marlcct rate toward which the 
readjustment tends is not the same rate which prevaiIed on the eve 
of the disarrangement. Such an occurrence may affect the data of the 
process of adjustment, but it does not affect its essence. 
The phenomenon to be dealt with is this: The rate of originary 
interest is determined by the discount of future goods as against 
present goods. It is essentially independent of the supply of money 
and money-substitutes, notwithstanding the fact that changes in the 
supply of money and money-substitutes can indirectly affect its 
height. But the gross market rate of interest can be affected by changes 
jn the money relation. A readjustment must take place. What is the 
nature of the process which brings it about? 
In this section we are concerned only with inflation and credit 
expansion. For the sake of simplicity we assume that the whole addi- 
tional amount of money and money-substitutes flows into the loan 
market and reaches the rest of the market only via the loans granted. 
This corresponds precisely to the conditions of an expansion of cir- 
culation credit.Wur scrutiny thus amounts to an analysis of the 
process caused by credit expansion. 
In dealing with this analysis, we must refer again to the price 
premium. It has been mentioned already that at the very begillning 
of a credit expansion no positive price premium arises. A price 
premium cannot appear until the additional supply of money (in 
the broader sense) has already begun to affect the prices of com-
modities and services. But as long as credit expansion goes on and 
additional quantities of fiduciary media are hurled on the loan mar- 

s. About the "long-wave" fluctuations, see below, pp. 572-273. 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 549 

ket, there continues a pressure upon the gross market rate of interest. 
The gross market rate would have to rise on account of the positive 
price premium which, with the progress of the expansionist process, 
would have to rise continually. But as credit expansion goes on, the 
gross market rate continues to lag behind the height at which it would 
cover both originary interest plus the positive price premium. 

It: is necessary to stress this point because it explodes the customary 
methods according to which people distinguish benveen what they 
consider low and high rates of interest. It is usual to take into account 
merely the arithmetical height of the rates or the trend which appears 
in their movement. Public opinion has definite ideas about a "normal" 
rate, something between 3 and 5 per cent. When the market rate rises 
above this hcight or when the market rates-without regard to their 
arithmetical ratio-are rising above their previous height, people be- 
lieve that they are right in speaking of high or rising interest rates. 
As against these errors, it is necessary to emphasize that under the 
conditions of a general rise in prices (drop in the monetary unit's 
purchasing power) the gross market rate of interest can be considered 
as unchanged w-ith regard to conditions of a period of a by and large 
unchanging purchasing power only if it includes a by and large ade- 
quate positive price premium. In this sense, the German Reichsbank's 
discount rate of go per cent was, in the fall of 1923, a low rate-indeed 
a ridiculously low rate-as it considerably lagged behind the price 
premium and did not leave anything for the other components of 
the gross market rate of interest. Essentially the same phenomenon 
manifests itseIf in every instance of a prolonged credit expansion. 
Gross market rates of interest rise in the further course of every ex- 
pansion, but they are nonetheless low as they do not correspond to 
the hcight required by the expected further general rise in prices. 

In analyzing the process of credit expansion, suppose we assume 
that the economic system's process of adjustment to the market data 
and of movement toward the establishment of final prices and interest 
rates is disturbed by the appearance of a new datum, namely, an 
additional quantity of fiduciary media offered on the loan market. 
At the gross market rate which prevailed on the eve of this disturb- 
ance, all those who were ready to borrow money at this rate, due 
allowance being made for the entrepreneurial component of each 
instance, could borrow as much as they wanted. Additional loans can 
be placed only at a lower gross market rate. It does not matter whether 
this drop in the gross market rate expresses itself in an arithmetical 
drop in the percentage stipulated in the loan contracts. It could hap- 
pen that the nominal interest rates remain unchanged and that the 


5 50 Human Action 

expansion manifests itself in the fact that at these rates loans are 
negotiated which would not have been made before on account of 
the height of the entrepreneurial component included. Such an out- 
come too amounts to a drop in gross market rates and brings about the 
same consequences. 

A drop in the gross market rate of interest affects the entrepre- 
neur's calculation concerning the chances of the profitability of 
projects considered. Along with the prices of the material factors of 
production, wage rates, and the anticipated future prices of the prod- 
ucts, interest rates are items that enter into the planning business- 
man's calculation. The result of this calculation shows the business- 
man whether or not a definite project will pay. It shows him what 
investments can bc made under the given state of the ratio in the 
public's valuation of future goods as against present goods. It brings 
his actions into agreement with this valuation. It prevents him from 
embarking upon projects the realization of which would be disap- 
proved by the public because of the length of the waiting time they 
require. It forces him to employ the available stock of capital goods 
in such a way as to satisfy best the most urgent wants of the con- 
sumcrs. 

nut now the drop in interest rates falsifies the businessman's cal- 
culation. Although the amount of capital goods available did not in- 
crease, the calculation employs figures which would be utilizable only 
if such an increase had taken place. The result of such calculations is 
thcrcfore misleading. They make some projects appear profitable and 
realizable which a correct calculation, based on an interest rate not 
manipulated by credit expansion, would have shown as unrealizable. 
Entrepreneurs embark upon the execution of such projects. Business 
activities are stimulated. A boom begins. 

The additional demand on the part of the expanding entrepre- 
neurs tends to raise the prices of producers' goods and wage rates. 
With the rise in wage rates the prices of consumers' goods rise too. 
Besides, [he enucpreneurs are contributing a share to the rise in he 
prices of consumers' goods as they too, deluded by the illusory gains 
which their business accounts show, are ready to consume more. The 
general upswing in prices spreads optimism. If only the prices of 
producers' goods had risen and those of consumcrs' goods had not 
been affected, the entrepreneurs would have become embarrassed. 
They would have had doubts concerning the soundness of their 
plans, as the rise in costs of production would have upset their cal- 
culations. But they are reassured by the fact that the demand for 
consumers' goods is intensified and makes it possible to expand sales 


Interest, Csedit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 55I 

in spite of rising prices, Thus they are confident that production will 
pay, notwithstanding the higher costs it involves. They are resolved 
to go on. 

Of course, in order to continue production on the enlarged scale 
brought about by the expansion of credit, all entrepreneurs, those 
who did expand ;heir activities no less than those who produce only 
within the limits in which they produced previously, need additional 
funds as the costs of production are now higher. If the credit expansion 
consists merely in a single, not repeated injection of a definite amount 
of fiduciary media into the loan market and then ceases altogether, the 
boom must very soon stop. The entrepreneurs cannot procure the 
funds they need for the further conduct of their ventures. The gross 
market rate of interest rises because the increased demand for loans 
is not counterpoised by a corresponding increase in the quantity of 
money available for lending. Commodity prices drop because some 
entrepreneurs are selling inventories and others abstain from buying. 
The size of business activities shrinks again. The boom ends because 
the forces which brought it about are no longer in operation. The 
additional quantity of circulation credit has exhausted its operation 
upon prices and wage rates. Prices, wage rates, and the various in- 
dividuals' cash hoIdings are adjusted to the new money relation; they 
move toward the final state which corresponds to this honey relation, 
without being disturbed by further injections of additional fiduciary 
media. The rate of interest which is coordinated to this new 
structure of the market acts with fulI momentum upon the gross mar- 
ket rate of interest. The gross market rate is no longer subject to 
disturbing influences exercised by cash-induced changes in the sup- 
ply of money (in the broader sense). 

The main deficiency of all attempts to explain the boom-viz., the 
general tendency to expand production and of all prices to rise- 
without reference to changes in the supply of money or fiduciary 
media, is to be seen in the fact that they disregard this circumstance. 
A general rise in prices can only occur if there is either a drop in the 
supply of all commodities or an increase in the supply of money (in 
the broader sense). Let us, for the sake of arprnen;, admit for the 
moment that the statements of these nonmonetary explanations of 
the boom and the trade cycle are correct. Prices advance and business 
activities expand although no increase in the supply of money has 
occurred. Then very soon a tendency toward a drop in prices must 
arise, the demand for loans must increase, the gross market rates of 
interest must rise, and the short-lived boom comes to an end. In fact, 
every nonmonetary trade-cycle doctrine tacitly assurnes-or ought 


Human Action 

logically to assume-that credit expansion is an attendant phenomenon 
of the boon^.^ It cannot help admitting that in the absence of such a 
crcdit expansion no boo~n could cmcrge and that the increase in the 
supply of money (in the broader sense) is a neccssary condition of 
thc general upward movement of prices. 'Thus on close inspection the 
statements of the nonmonetary explanations of cyclical fluctuations 
shrink to the assertion that credit expansion, while an indispensable 
requisite of the boom, is in irself alone not sufficient to bring it about 
and that some further conditions are required for its appearance. 

Yet, even in this restricted sense, the tcachings of the nonmonetary 
doctrines are vain. It is cvident that every expansion of crcdit must 
bring about thc boom as dcscribed above. The boom-creating tend- 
ency of crcdit expansion can fail to come only if another factor 
simultaneously counterbalances its growth. If, for instance, u+ile the 
banks cxpand credit, it is expected that the government will com- 
pleteIy tax away the businessmen's "exccss" profits or that it will 
stop the further progrcss of crcdit expansion as soon as "pump-prim- 
ing" will havc resulted in rising prices, no boom can develop. The 
entrcprcneurs will abstain from expanding their venturcs with the 
aid of the cheap credits offered by the banks because they cannot 
expect to increase thcir gains. It is necessary to mention this fact be- 
cause it explains the failure of the New Dcal's pump-priming measures 
and other events of the 'thirties. 

The boom can last only as long as the credit expansion progresses 
at an ever-acccleratcd pace. The boom comes to an end as soon as 
additional quantities of fiduciary media are no longer thrown upon 
the loan markct. But it could iot last forever even if inflation and 
credit expansion were to go on cndlessly. It would then encounter 
the barricrs which prevent the boundless expansion of circulation 
crcdjr. It would lead to the crack-up boom and the breakdown of the 
whole monetary system. 

The essence of monetary theory is the cognition that cash-induced 

changes in the money reiation affect the various prices, wage rates, 

and intercst ratcs neither at the same time nor to the same extent. If 

this unevenness were absent, money would bc ncutral; changes in the 

moncy relation would not affect the structure of business, the size 

and direction of production in the various branchcs of industry, con- 

sumption, and the wealth and income of the various strata of the pop- 

ulation. Then the gross market rate of interest too would not be 

affected+ither temporariIy or lastingly-by changes in the sphere 

6. Cf. G. v. Haberler, Prosperity and Depression (new ed. League of Nations' 
Report, Geneva, 1939)~p. 7. 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Tmde Cycle 553 

of money and circulation credit. The fact that such changes can 
nlodifv the rate of originary interest is caused by the changes which 
this unevenness brings about in the wealth and income of various in- 
dividuals. The fact that, apart from these changes in the rate of 
originary interest, the gross market rate is temporariIy affected is in 
itself a manifestation of this unevenness. If the additional quantity of 
money enters the economic system in such a way as to reach the loan 
market only at a date at which it has already made commodity prices 
and wage rates rise, these immediate temporary effects upon the 
gross market rate of interest will be either slight or entirely absent. 
The gross market rate of interest is the more violently affected, the 
sooner the inflowing additional supply of money or fiduciary media 
yeaches the loan market. 

When under the conditions of credit expansion the whole amount 
of the additionaI money substitutes is lent to businessmen, produc- 
tion is expanded. The entrepreneurs embark either upon lateral ex- 
pansion of production (viz., the expansion of production without 
lengthening the period of production in the individual industry) or 
upon longitudinal expansion (viz., the lengthening of the period 
of production). In either case, the additional plants require the in- 
vestment of additional factors of production. But the amount of 
capital goods available for investment has not increased. Neither does 
credit expansion bring about a tendency toward a restriction of con- 
sumption. It is true, as has been pointed out above in dealing with 
forced saving, that in the further progress of the expansion a part of 
the population will be compelled to restrict its consuinption. But 
it depends on the particular conditions of each instance of credit 
expansion whether this forced saving of some groups of the people 
will overcompensate the increase in consumption on the part of other 
groups and will thus result in a net increase in the total amount of 
saving in the whole market system. At any rate, the immediate con- 
sequence of credit expansion is a rise in cbnsumption on the part of 
those wage earners whose wages have risen on account of the in- 
tensified demand for labor displayed by the expanding entrepreneurs. 
Ixt US for the sake of argument assume that the increased consump- 
tion of these wage earners favored by the inflation and the forced 
saving of other groups prejudiced by the inflation are equal in amount 
and that no change in the total amount of consumption has occurred. 
Then the situation is this: Production has been altered in such a way 
that the length of waiting time has been extended. But the demand 
for consunlers' goods has not dropped so as to make the available 
supplv last for a longer period. Of course, this fact results in a rise 


5 54 Human Action 
in the prices of consumers' goods and thus brings about the tendency 
toward forced saving. However, this rise in the prices of consumers' 
goods strengthens the tendency of business to expand. The entrc- 
preneurs draw from the fact that demand and prices are rising the 
inference that it will pay to invest and to produce morc. They go on 
and their intensified activities bring about a further rise in the prices 
of producers' goods, in wage rates, and thereby again in the prices of 
consumcrs' goods. Business boom as long as the banks are willing to 
expand credit more and more. 
On the eve of the credit expansion all thosc production processes 
were in opcration which, under the given state of the market data, 
were deemed profitablc. The system was moving toward a state in 
which all those eager to earn wages would be enlployed and all 
nonconvertible factors of production would be employed to the 
extent that the demand of the consumers and the available supply 
of nonspecific material factors and of labor would permit. A further 
expansion of production is possible only if the amount of capital goods 
is increased by additional saving, i.e., by surpluses produced and not 
consumed. The characteristic mark of the credit-expansion boom 
is that such additional capital goods have not been made available. 
The capital goods required for the expansion of business activities 
must be withdrawn from other lines of production. 
We may calI p the total supply of capital goods available on the 
eve of the credit expansion, and g the total amount of consumers' 
goods which these p could, over a definite period of time, make 
available for consumption without prejudice to further productior,. 
Now thc entrepreneurs, enticed by credit expansion, embark upon 
the production of an additional quantity of g3of goods of the same 
kind which they already used to produce, and of a quantity of g4 
of goods of a kind not produced by then1 before. For the production 
of g,a supply of p3 of capital goods is needed, and for the production 
of g4a supply of p4. But as, according to our assumptions, the amount 
of capita1 goods available has remained unaltered, the quantities f13 
and p4 are lacking. It is preciscly this fact that distinguishes the 
"artificial" boom created by credit expansion from a "normal" ex-
pansion of production which only the addition of pa and p4 to p can 
bring about. 
Let us call r that amount of capital goods which, out of the gross 
proceeds of production over a definite period of time, must be re- 
invested for the replacement of those parts of p used up in the process 
of production. If r is employed for such replacement, one will be in 
a position to turn out g again in the following period of time; if r 


Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle j55 

is withheld from this employment, p will be reduced by r, and p -r 
will turn out in thc following period of time only g -a. We may fur- 
ther assume that the economic system affected by credit expansion 
is a progressing system. It produced "normally," as it were, in the 
period of time preceding the credit expansion a surplus of capital 
goods pl +p2. If no credit expansion had intervened, p, would have 
been employed for the production of an additional quantity of g.1 
of the kind of goods produced previously, and p2 for the prdduction 
of the supply g, of a kind of goods not produced before. The total 
amount of capital goods which are at the entrepreneurs' disposal 
and with regard to which they are frce to make plans is r + pl + p,. 
However, deluded by the cheap money, they act as if r +p, +pz -+ 
p:)-+-p4were available and as if they were in a position to produce 
not only g + gl f g2,but beyond this also g~+G.They outbid 
one another in competing for a share of a supply of capital goods 
which is insufficient for the realization of their overambitious 
plans. 

The ensuing boom in the prices of producers' goods may at the 
beginning outrun the rise in the prices of consumers' goods. It may 
thus bring about a tendency toward a fall in the originary rate of in- 
terest. But with the further progress of the expansionist movement 
the rise in the prices of the consumers' goods will outstrip the rise 
in the prices of producers' goods. The rise in wages and salaries and 
the additional gains of the capitalists, entrepreneurs, and farmers, 
although a grcat part of them is merely apparent, intensify the de- 
mand for consumers' goods. There is no need to enter into a scrutiny 
of thc assertion of the advocates of credit expansion that the boom 
can, by mcans of forced saving, really increase the total supply of 
consumers' goods. At any rate, it is certain that the intensified de- 
mand for consumers' goods affects the market at a time when the 
additional investments are not yet in a position to turn out their 
products. The gulf between the prices of present goods and those 
of future goods widens again. A tendency toward a rise in the rate 
of originary interest is substituted for the tendency toward the op- 
posite which may have come into operation at the earlier stages of the 
expansion. 

This tcndency toward a rise in the rate of originary interest and 

the emergence of a positive price premium explain some character- 

istics of the boom. The banks are faced with an increased demand 

for loans and advances on the part of business. The entrepreneurs are 

prepared to borrow money at higher gross rates of interest. They go 

on borrowing in spite of the fact that the banks charge more interest. 


Human Action 

Arithmetically, the gross rates of interest are rising above their height 
on the eve of the expansion. Konetheless, they lag catallactically be-
hind the height at which they would cover originary interest plus 
entrepreneurial component and price premium. The banks believe 
that they have done a11 that is needed to stop "unsound" speculation 
when they lend on more onerous terms. They think that those critics 
who blame them for fanning the flames of ;he boom-frenzy of the 
market are wrong. 'They fail to see that in injecting more and more 
fiduciary media into the market they are in fact kindling the boom. 
It is the continuous increase in the supply of the fiduciary media that 
produces, feeds, and accelerates the boom. The state of the gross 
rnarltct rates of interest is only an outgrowth of this increase. If one 
wants to know whether or not there is credit expansion, one must 
look at the state of the supply of fiduciary media, not at the arithmet- 
ical state of interest rates. 

It is customary to describe the boom as overinvestment. However, 
additional investment is oniy possible to the extent that there is an 
additional supply of capital goods available. As, apart from forced 
saving, the boom itself does not result in a restriction but rather in 
an increase in consumption, it does not procure more capital goods 
for new investment. The essence of the credit-expansion boom is 
not overinvestment, but invcstment in wrong lines, i.e., malinvestmcnt. 
The entrepreneurs employ the available supply of 1.-4-p, +pa as if 
they were in a position to employ a supply of r +PI+ p, f p, +p4. 
They embark upon an expansion of invcstment on a scale for which 
the capital goods available do not suffice. Their projects arc unrealiz- 
able on account of the insufficient supply of capital goods. They must 
fail sooner or later. The unavoidable end of the credit expansion 
rnalrcs the faults committed visible. There are plants which cannot 
be utilized because the plants needed for the production of the 
complementary factors of production are lacking; plants the prod- 
ucts of which cannot be sold because the consumers arc more intent 
upon purchasing other goods which, however, are not produced in 
sufficient quantities; plants the construction of n~hich cannot be 
continued and finished because it has become obvious that they will 
not pay. 

The erroneous belief that the essential feature of the boom is over- 
investment and not malinvestment is due to the habit of judging condi- 
tions merely according to what is perceptible and tangible. The 
observer notices only the malinvestments which are visible and fails 
to recognize that these establishments are malinvestments only be- 
cause of the fact that other plants-those required for the production 


Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 557 

of the complementary factors of production and those required for 
the production of consumers7 goods more urgently demanded by 
the public-are lacking. TechnoIogical conditions rnakc it neces-
sary to start an expansion of production by expanding first the size 
of the plants producing the goods of those orders which are farthest 
removed from the finished consumers' goods. In order to expand the 
production of shoes, clothes, motorcars, furniture, houses, one must 
begin with increasing the production of iron, steel, copper, and other 
such goods. In employing the supply of r + PI +p~ which would 
suEce for the production of a + g1+ g2 as if it were r + pl + p2 f 
p3+ p4and would suffice for the production of a +gl +g, + g, $-
g4,one must first engage in increasing the output of those products 
and structures which for physical reasons are first required. The whole 
entrepreneurial class is, as it were, jn the position of a master-builder 
whose task it is to erect a building out of a limited supply of build- 
ing materials. If this man overestimates the quantity of the available 
supply, he drafts a plan for the execution of which the means at his 
disposal are not sufficicnt. He ovcrsizcs the groundwork and the 
foundations and only discovers later in the progress of the construc- 
tion that he lacks the material needed for the completion of the 
struccure. It is obvious that our master-builder's fault was not over- 
investment, but an inappropriate employment of the means at his 

disposal. 

It is no less erroneous to believe that the events which resulted in 
the crisis amounted to an undue conversion of "circulating" capital 
into "fixed" capital. The individual entrepreneur, when faced with 
the credit stringency of the crisis, is right in regretting that he has 
expended too much ?or an expansion of his plant and for the purchase 
of durable equipment; he would have been in a better situation if the 
funds used for these purposes were still at his disposal for the cur- 
rent conduct of business. However, raw materiaIs, primary com-
rnoditics, half-finished manufactures and foodstuffs are not lacking 
at the turning point at which the upswing turns into the depression. 
On the contrary, the crisis is precisely characterized by the fact that 
these goods are offered in such quantities as to make their prices drop 
sharply. 

The foregoing statements explain why an expansion in the pro- 
duction facilities and the production of the heavy industries, and in 
the production of durable producers7 goods, is the most conspicuous 
mark of the boom. The editors of the financial and commercial 
chronicles were right when-for more than a hundred years-they 
looked upon production figures of these industries as well as of the 


Human Action 

construction trades as an index of business fluctuations. They were 
only mistaken in referring to an alleged overinvestment. 

Of course, the boom affects also the consumers' goods industries. 
They too invest more and expand their production capacity. How- 
ever, the new plants and the new annexes added to the already existing 
plants are not always those for the products of which the demand of 
the public is most intense. They may we11 have agreed with the whole 
plan aiming at the production of r $-g, +.g2 $ g3 $-g4. The failure 
of this oversized plan discloses their inappropriateness. 

A sharp rise in commodity prices is not always an attending phe- 
nomenon of the boom. The increase of the quantity of fiduciary 
media certainly always has the potential effect of making prices rise. 
But it may happen that at the same time forces operating in the 
opposite direction are strong enough to keep the rise in prices within 
narrow limits or even to remove it entirely. The historical period in 
which the smooth working of the market economy was again and 
again interrupted through expansionist ventures was an epoch of 
continuous economic progress. The steady advance in the accumula- 
tion of new capital made technological improvement possible. Output 
per unit of input was increased and business fiIled the markets with 
increasing quantities of cheap goods. If the synchronous increase in 
the supply of money (in the broader sense) had been less plentiful 
than it really was, a tendency toward a drop in the prices of all 
commodities would have taken effect. As an actual historical event 
credit expansion was always embedded in an environment in which 
powerful factors were counteracting its tendency to raise prices. 
As a rule the resultant of the clash of opposite forces was a pre- 
ponderance of those producing a rise in prices. But thcrc were some 
exceptional instances too in which the upward movement of prices 
was only slight. The most remarkable example was provided by the 
American boom of I~zG-29. 

The essential features of a credit expansion are not affected by such 
a particular constellation of the market data. What induces an entre- 
preneur to embark upon definite projects is neither high prices nor 
low prices as such, but a discrepancy between the costs of production, 
inclusive of interest on the capital required, and the anticipatcd prices 
of the products. A lowering of the gross market rate of interest as 
brought about by credit expansion always has the effect of making 
some projects appear profitable which did not appear so before. It 
actuates business to employ r +pl+pz as if it were r +PI+ pz + 
p3 +p,. It necessarily brings about a structure of investment and 
production activities which is at variance with the real supply of 


Interest, Credit Expansion,the Trade Cycle 559 

capital goods and must finally collapse. That sometimes the price 
changes involved are laid against a background of a general tendency 
toward a rise in purchasing power and do not convert this tend- 
ency into its ~nanifest opposite but only into something which may 
bv and large be called price stability, modifies merely some accessories 
oi the process. 

However conditions may be, it is certain that no manipulations of 
the banks can provide the economic system with capital goods. What 
is needed for a sound expansion of production is additional capital 
goods, not money or fiduciary media. The boom is built on the sands 
of banknotes and deposits. It must collapse. 

The breakdown appears as soon as the banks become frightened 
by the accelerated pace of the boom and begin to abstain from fur- 
ther expansion of credit. The boom could continue only as long as 
the banks were ready to grant freely all those credits which business 
needed for the execition of its excessive projects, utterly disagreeing 
with the red state of the supply of factors of production and the 
valuations of the consumers. These illusory plans, suggested by the 
falsification of business calculation as brought about by the cheap 
money policy, can be pushed forward only if new credits can be 
obtained at gross rnarket rates which are artificially lowered below 
the height they would reach at an unhampered loan market. It is 
this margin that gives them the deceptive appearance of profitability. 
The change in the banks' conduct does not create the crisis. It merely 
makes visible the havoc spread by the faults which business has com- 
mitted in the boom period. 

Neither couId the boom last endlessly if the banks were to cling 
stubbornly to their expansionist policics. Any attempt to substitute 
additional fiduciary media for nonexisting capital goods (namely, the 
qtmtities p, and p,i) is doomed to failure. If the credit expanu&n is 
not stopped in timc, the boom turns into the crack-up boom; the 
flight into real values begins, and the whole monetary system founders. 
However, as a rule, the banks in the past have not pushed things to 
extremes. They have become alarmed at a date when the final catas- 
trophe was still far away.? 

7. One sllould not fall prey to the illusion that these changes in the credit 
policies of the banks were caused by the bankers' and the monetary authorities' 
insight into the unavoidable consequences of a continued credit expansion. What 
induced the turn in the banks' conduct was certain institutional conditions to be 
dealt with further below, on pp. 790-791. Among the champions of economics 
some private bankers were prominent; in particular, the elaboration of the early 
form of the theory of business fluctuations, the Currency Theory, was for the 
most part an achievement of British bankers. But the management of central 
banks and the conduct of the various governments' monetary policies was as a 

As soon as the afflux of additional fiduciary media comes to an 
end, the airy castle of the boom collapses. The entrepreneurs must 
restrict their activities because they lack the funds for their con-
tinuation on the exaggerated scale. Prices drop suddenly because 
these distressed firms try to obtain cash by throwing inventories on 
the market dirt cheap. Factories are closed, the continuation of con- 
struction projects in progress is halted, workers are discharged. As 
on the one hand many firms badly need money in order to avoid 
bankruptcy, and on the other hand no firm any longer enjoys con- 
fidence, the entrepreneurial component in the gross market rate of 
interest jumps to an excessive height. 

Accidental institutional and psychological circumstances generally 
turn the outbreak of the crisis into a panic. The description of these 
awful events can be left to the historians. It is not the task of catallactic 
theory to depict in detail the calamities of panicky days and weeks 
and to dwell upon their sometimes grotesque aspects. Economics is 
not interested in what is accidental and conditioned by the individual 
historical circumstances of each instance. Its aim is, on the contrary, 
to distinguish what is essential and apodictically necessary from what 
is merely adventitious. It is not interested in the psychological aspects 
of the panic, but only in the fact that a credit-expansion boom must 
unavoidably lead to a process which everyday speech calls the 
depression. It must realize that the depression is in fact the process 
of readjustment, of putting production activities anew in agreement 
with the given state of the market data: the available supply of factors 
of production, the valuations of the consumers, and particularly 
also the state of originary interest as manifested in the public's valua- 
tions. 

'These data, however, are no longer identical with those that pre- 

vailed on the eve of the expansionist process. A good many things 

have changed. Forced saving and, to an even greater extent, regular 

voluntary saving may have provided new capital goods which were 

not totaiiy squandered rhrough maiinvestment and overconsump- 

tion as induced by the boom. Changes in the weaIth and income of 

various individuals and groups of individuals have been brought about 

by the unevenness inherent in every inflationary movement. Apart 

from any causal relation to the credit expansion, population may 

have changed with regard to figures and the characteristics of the 

individuals comprising them; technological knowledge may have 

advanced, demand for certain goods may have been altered. The 

rule entrusted to men who did not find any fault with boundless credit expansion 
and took offense at every criticism of their expansionist ventures. 


Interest, Credit Expnnsion, the Trade Cycle j6 I 

final state to the establishnient of which the market tends is no longer 
the same toward which it tended bcfore thc disturbances created 
by the credit expansion. 

Some of the invcstnicnts niadc jn the boom period appear, whcn 
appraised with the sober judgment of the rcadjmtment period, no 
longer din~ncd by thc illusions of thc upswing, as absolutely hope-
less failures. They must simply be abandoned hecausc thc current 
rneans requircd for their further exploitation cannot be recovered 
in selling their products; this "circulatiug" capital is rnorc urgently 
11ecdcd in other branches of want-satisfaction; the proof is that it 
can t)c employed in a more profitable way in other fields. Other 
~nalinvestmcnts offer somewhat more favoratrlc chances. Tt is, of 
course, true that one would not have embarked upon pntting capital 
goods into thcm if one had correctly calculated. The inconvertible 
invcstnlents niade on their behalf are certainly wastcd. But as they 
are inconvertible, a fait accowzpli, they prescnt further action with 
a ncw problem. If the proceeds which the sale of thcir products 
promises are expected to exceed the costs of current operation, it is 
profitable to carry on. Although the prices ~.hich the buving public 
is prepared to allow for their products are not high cno@h to make 
thc whole of thc inconvertible investmcnt profitable, they are sufficient 
to make a fraction, hou~cver small, of the investment profitable. The 
rest of the investment must be considercd as expenditure without 
any offset. as capital squandercd and lost. 

If one looks at this outcome from the point of view of the con- 
sumers, the rcsnIt is, of course, thc same. The consumers would be 
[letter off if the iIlusions created by the casy-moncy policy had not 
emiced the entrcprencurs to waste scarce capital goods by investing 
them for the satisfaction of lcss urgent needs and withholding thcm 
from lines of production in which they would have satisfied more 
urgent nceds. But as things are now, they cannot but put up with 
uhat is irrevocable. They must for the tirnc being rcnouncc certain 
amenities which thcy c;uld have enjoyed if the boom had not en- 
gendcred rnalinvcstment. But, on the othcr hand, thev can find partial 
compensation in the fact that some enjoyments aie now available 
to thcm which would have been beyond thcir reach if the smooth 
course of cconomic activitics had n& been disturbed by the orgies 
of the boom. It is slight compensation only, as their demand for those 
other things which the); do not get because of inappropriate empIoy- 
nlent of capital goods is more intensc than their demand for these 
"s~htitutcs," as it were. But it is the only choicc left to thern as 
conditions and data are now. 


j62 Human Action 

The final outcome of the credit expansion is gencral impoverish- 
ment. Some people may have increased their wealth; they did not let 
their reasoning be obfuscated by the mass hysteria, and took advantage 
in time of the opportunities offered by the mobility of the individual 
investor. Other individuals and groups of individuals may have been 
favored, without any initiative of their own, by the mere time lag 
between the rise in ;he prices of the goods they sell and those they 
buy. But the immense majority must foot the bill for the malinvest- 
ments and the overco~~sumption 

of the boom episode. 

One must guard oneself against a misinterpretation of this term 
impoverishment. It does not mean impoverishment whcn compared 
with the conditions that prevailed on the eve of the credit expansion. 
Whether or not an impoverishment in this sense takes place depends 
on the particular data of each case; it cannot be predicated apodicti- 
cally by catallactics. What catallactics has in mind when asserting 
that impoverishment is an unavoidablc outgrowth of credit expansion 
is in~poverishment as compared with the state of affairs which would 
have developed in the absence of credit expansion and the boom. The 
characteristic mark of cconomic history under capitalism is unceasing 
economic progress, a steady increase in the quantity of capital goods 
available, and a continuous trend toward an improvement in the 
general standard of living. The pace of this progress is so rapid that, 
in the course of a boom period, it may well outstrip the synchronous 
losses caused by rnalinvestment and overconsumption. Then the eco- 
nornic system as a whole is more prosperous at the end of the boom 
than it was at its very beginning; it appears impoverished only when 
compared with the potentialities which existed for a still bettcr state 
of satisfaction. 

The Alleged Absence of Depressions Under Totalitarian Management 

Many socialist authors emphasize that the recurrence of economic crises 
and business depressions is a phenon~enon inherent in the capitalist mode 
of production. On the other hand, a socialist system is safe against this evil. 

As has already become obvious and will be shown later agaln, the cycl~cal 
fluctuations of business are not an occurrence originating in the sphere of 
the unhampered market, but a product of government interference with 
business conditions designed to lower the rate of interest below the height 
at which the free market would have fixed it.8 At this point we have only 
to deal with the alleged stabiliv as secured by socialist planning. 

It is essential to realize that what makes the economic crisis emerge is the 

democratic process of the market. The consumers disapprove of the em- 

ployment of the factors of production as effected by the entrepreneurs. 

8. Cf. below, pp. 787-789. 

Irztc~est,Credit Expmsion, the Tmde Cycle 

They manifest their disapprobation by their conduct in buying and absten- 
tion from buying. The entrepreneurs, misled by the illusions of the artifi- 
cially lowered gross market rate of interest, have failed to invest in those 
lines in which the most urgent needs of the public would have been satisfied 
in the best possible way. As soon as the credit expansion comes to an end, 
these faults become manifest. The attitudes of the consumers force the 
businessmen to adjust their activities anew to the best possible want-satis- 
faction. It is this process of liquidation of the faults committed in the boom 
and of readjustment to the wishes of the consumers which is called the de- 
pression. 

But in a sociaIist economy it is only the government's value judgments 
that count, and the people are deprived of any means of making their own 
value judgments prevail. A dictator does not bother about whether or not 
the masses approve of his decision concerning how much to devote for 
current consumption and how much for additional investment. If the 
dictator invests more and thus curtails the means available for current con- 
sumption, the people must eat less and hold their tongues. No crisis emerges 
because the subjects have no opportunity to utter their dissatisfaction. 
Where there is no business at all, business can be neither good nor bad. 
There may be starvation and famine, but no depression in the sense in 
which this term is used in dealing with the problems of a market economy. 
Where the individuals are not free to choose, they cannot protest against 
the methods applied by those directing the course of production activities. 

It is no answer to this to object that public opinion in the capitalist coun- 
tries favors the policy of cheap money. The masses are misled by the as- 
sertions of the pseudo-experts that cheap money can make them prosperous 
at no expense whatever. They do not realize that investment can be ex- 
panded only to the extent that more capital is accumulated by saving. They 
are deceived by the fairy tales of monetary cranks. Yet what counts in 
reality is not fairy tales, but people's conduct. If men are not prepared to 
save more by cutting down their current consumption, the means for a 
substantial expansion of investment are lacking. l'hcse means cannot be 
provided by printing banknotes and by credit on the bank books. 

It is a common phenomenon that the individual in his capacity as a voter 
virtually contradicts his conduct on the market. Thus, for instance, he may 
vote for measures which will raise the price of one commodity or of all 
commodities, while as a buyer he wants to see these prices low. Such con- 
flicts arise out of ignorance and error. As human nature is, they can happen. 
But in a social organization in which the individual is neither a voter nor a 
buyer, or in which voting and buying are merely a sham, they are absent. 


7. The Gross Market Rate of Interest as Affected by 
Deflation and Credit Contraction 
We assume that in the course of a deflationary process the whole 
amount by which the supply of money (in the broader sense) is 
reduced is taken from the loan market. Then the loan market and 
the gross market rate of interest are affected at the very beginning of 
the process, at a moment at which the prices of commodities and 
services are not yet altered by the change going on in the money 
relation. We may, for instance, posit that a government aiming at 
deflation floats a loan and destroys the paper money borrowed. Such 
a procedure has been, in the last two hundred years, adopted again 
and again. The idea was to raise, after a prolonged period of in- 
flationary policy, the national monetary unit to its previous ~netallic 
parity. Of course, in most cases the deflationary projects were soon 
abandoned as their execution encountered increasing opposition and, 
moreover, heaviIy burdened the treasury. Or we may assume that 
the banks, frightened by their adverse experience in the crisis brought 
about by credit expansion, are intent upon increasing the reserves 
held against their liabilities and therefore restrict the amount of cir- 
culation credit. A third possibility would be that the crisis has re- 
sulted in the bankruptcy of banks which granted circulation credit 
and that the annihilation of the fiduciary media issued by these banks 
reduces the supply of credit on the loan market. 

In all these cases a temporary tendency toward a rise in the gross 
market rate of interest ensues. Projects which would have appeared 
profitable before appear so no longer. A tendency develops toward 
a fall in the prices of factors of production and later toward a fall in 
the prices of consumers' goods also. nusiness becomes slack. The 
deadlock ceases only when prices and wage rates are by and large 
adjusted to the new money relation. Then the loan market too adapts

is no longer disarranged by a shortage of money offered for advances. 
Thus a cash-induced rise in the gross market rate of interest produces 
a temporary stagnation of business. Deflation and credit contraction 
no less than inflation and credit expansion are ele~nents disarranging 
the smooth course of economic activities, and sources of disturbance. 
However, it is a blunder to look upon deflation and contraction as if 
they were simply counterparts of inflation and expansion. 

Expansion produces first the illusory appearance of prosperity. It 
is extremely popular because it seems to make the majority, even 


Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 565 

everybody, more affluent. It has an enticing quality. A special moral 
effort is needed to stop it. On the other hand, contraction immediately 
produces conditions which everybody is ready to condemn as evil. 
Its unpopularity is even greater than the popularity of expansion. It 
creates violent opposition. Very soon the ~olitical forces fighting it 
become irresistible. 

Fiat: money inflation and cheap loans to the government convey 
additional funds to the treasury; deflation depletes the treasury's 
vaults. Credit expansion is a boon for the banks, contraction is a 
forfeiture. There is a temptation in inflation and expansion and a 
repellent in deflation and contraction. 

But the dissimilarity between the two opposite modes of money 
and credit manipulation not only consists in the fact that while one of 
them is popular the other is universally loathed. Deflation and con- 
traction are less likely to spread havoc than inflation and expansion not 
merely because they are only rarely resorted to. They are less dis- 
astrous also on account of their inherent effects. Expansion squanders 
scarce factors of production by malinvestment and overconsumption. 
If it once comes to an end, a tedious process of recovery is needed 
in order to wipe out the impoverishment it has left behind. But 
contraction produces neither malinvestment nor overconsumption. 
The temporary restriction in business activities that it engenders may 
by and large be offset by the drop in consumption on the part of the 
discharged wage earners and the owners of the material factors of 
production the sales of which drop. No protracted scars are left. When 
the contraction comes to an end, the process of readjustment does not 
need to make good for losses caused by capital consumption. 

Deflation and credit restriction never played a noticeable role in 

economic history. The outstanding examples were provided by Great 

Britain's return, both after the wartime inflation of the Napoleonic 

wars and after that of the first World War, to the prewar gold parity 

of the sterling. In each case Parliament and Cabinet adopted the 

deflationist policy without having weighed the pros and cons of the 

two neth hods open for a return to the gold standard. In the second 

decade of the nineteenth century they could be exonerated, as at that 

time monetary theory had not yet 'clarified the problems involved. 

More than a hundred years later it was simply a display of inexcusable

Ignorance manifests itself also in the confusion of deflation and 

contraction and of the process of readjustment into which every 

expansionist boom must lead. It depends on the institutiona1 structure

of thc credit system which created the boom whether or not the 
crisis brings about a restriction in the amount of fiduciary media. Such 
a restriction may occur svhen the crisis result5 in the bankruptcy of 
banks granting circulation credit and the falling off is not counter- 
poised by a corresponding expansion on thc part of thc remaining 
banks. But it is not necessarily an attendant phenomenon of the de- 
pression; it is beyond doubt that it has not appcared in the last eighty 
years in Europe and that the extent to which it occurred in the United 
States under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913has been grossly ex- 
aggerated. The dearth of credit which marks thc crisis is caused not 
by contraction but by the abstention from further credit expansion. 
It hurts all enterprise;-not only those which are doomed at any ratc, 
but no less those whose business is sound and could flourish if appro- 
priate credit were available. As the outstanding debts are not paid 
back, the banks lack the means to grant credits even to the most solid 
firms. The crisis becomes general and forces all branches of business 
and all firms to restrict the scopc of their activities. But there is no 
means of avoiding these secondary consequences of the preceding 
boom. They are inevitable. 

As soon as the depression appears, there is a general lament over 
deflation and people clamor for a continuation of the expansionist 
policy. Now, it is truc that even with no restrictions in the supply 
of money propcr and fiduciary media a\iailable, thc depression brings 
about a cash-induced tendency toward an increase in the purchasing 
power of the monetary unit. Every firm is intent upon increasing its 
cash holdings, and these endeavors affect the ratio between the supply 
of money (in the broader sense) and the demand for money (in the 
broader sense) for cash holding. This may bc properly called deflation. 
But it is a serious blunder to bclieve that the fall in commodity prices 
is causccl by this striving after greater cash holding. The causation is 
the other way around. Prices of the factors of production-both 
material and human-have rcached an excessive height in the boom 
period. They must come down before business can become profitabie 
again. The entrepreneurs enlarge their cash holding because they 
abstain from buying goods and hiring workcrs as long as the structurre 
of priccs and wages is not adjusted to the real state of the market data. 
Thus any attempt of the government or the labor unions to prevent 
or to delay this adjustment merely prolongs the stagnation. 

Even cconomists often failed to comprehend this concatcnation. 
Thcy argued thus: The structure of prices as it developed in the boom 
was a product of the expansionist pressure. If the further increase in 


Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 567 

fiduciary media comes to an end, the upward movement of prices and 
wages must stop. But, if there were no deflation, no drop in prices 
and wage rates co~dd result. 

This reasoning would be correct if the inflationary pressure had 
not affected the loan market before it had exhausted its direct effects 
upon commodity prices. Let us assume that a government of an 
isolated country issues additional paper money in order to pay doles 
to the citizens of moderate income. The rise in commodity prices 
thus brought about would disarrange production; it would tend to 
shift production from the consumers' goods regularly bought by the 
nonsubsidized groups of the nation to those which the subsidized 
groups are demanding. If the policy of subsidizing some groups in 
this way is later abandoned, the prices of the goods demanded by 
those formerly subsidized will drop and the prices of the goods de- 
manded by those formerly nonsubsidized will rise more sharply. But 
there will be no tendency of the monetary unit's purchasing power 
to return to the state of the' pre-inflation period. The structure of 
prices will be lastingly affected by the inflationary venture if the 
government does not withdraw from the market the additional 
quantity of paper money it has injected in the shape of subsidies. 

Conditions are different under a credit expansion which first affects 

the loan market. In this case the inflationary effects are multiplied by 

the consequences of capital malinvestment and overconsumption. 

Overbidding one another in the struggle for a greater share in the 

limited supply of capital goods and labor, the entrepreneurs push 

prices to a height at which they can remain only as long as the credit 

expansion goes on at an accelerated pace. A sharp drop in the prices 

of all comnlodities and services is unavoidable as soon as the further 

inflow of additional fiduciary media stops. 

While the boom is in progress, there prevails a general tendency to 

buy as much as one can buy because a further rise in prices is antici- 

pated. In the depression, on the other hand, people abstain from buying 

because they expect that prices will continue to drop. The recovery 

and the return to "normalcy" can only begin when prices and wage 

rates are so low that a sufficient number of peoplc assume that they 

will not drop still more. Therefore the only means to shorten the 

period of bad business is to avoid any attempts to delay or to check the 

fall in prices and wage rates. 

Only when the recovery begins to take shape does the change in 

the money relation, as effected by the increase in the quantity of 

fiduciary media, begin to manifest itself in the structure of prices. 


j68 Human Action 

The Difference Between Credit Expansion and Simple Inflation 

In dealing with the consequences of credit expansion we assumed that the 
total amount of additional fiduciary media enters the market system via 
the loan market as advances to business. All that has been predicated with 
regard to the effects of credit expansion refers to this condition. 

There are, however, instances in which the legal and technical methods 
of credit expansion are used for a procedure catallactically utterly differ- 
ent from genuine credit expansion. Political and institutional convenience 
sometimes makes it expedient for a government to take advantage of the 
facilities of banking as a substitute for issuing government fiat money. The 
treasury borrows from the bank, and the bank provides the funds needed 
by issuing additional banknotes or crediting the government on a deposit 
account. Legally the bank becomes the treasury's creditor. In fact the 
whole transaction amounts to fiat money inflation. The additional fiduci- 
ary media enter the market by way of the treasury as payment for various 
items of government expenditure. It is this additional government demand 
that incites business to expand its activities. The issuance of these newly 
created fiat money sums does not directly interfere with the gross market 
rate of interest, whatever the rate of interest may be which the government 
pays to the bank. They affect the loan market and the gross market rate of 
interest, apart from the emergence of a positive price premium, only if a 
part of them reaches the loan market at a time at which their effects upon 
commodity prices and wage rates have not yet been consumrnatcd. 

Such were, for example, the conditions in the United States in the second 
World War. Apart from the credit expansion policy, which the Adminis- 
tration had already adopted before the outbreak of the war, the govern- 
ment borrowed heavily from the commercial banks. This was technically 
credit expansion; essentially it was a substitute for the issuance of green- 
backs. Even more complicated techniques were resorted to in many coun- 
tries. Thus, for instance, the German Reich in the first World War sold 
bonds to the public. The Reichsbank financed these purchases by lending 
the greater part of the funds needed to the buyers against the same bonds 
as collateral. Apart from the fraction which the buyer contributed from 
his own funds, the roIe that the Bank and the public played in the whoIe 
transaction was mereiy formal. Virtuaily, the adciitionai banknotes were 
inconvertible paper money. 

It is important to pay heed to these facts in order not to confuse the con- 
sequences of credit expansion proper and those of government-made fiat 
money inflation. 

8. The Monetary or Circulation Credit Theory of the 
Trade Cycle 
The theory of the cyclical fluctuations of business as elaborated by 
the British Currency School was in two respects unsatisfactory. 


Inte~est, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 569 

First it faiIed to recognize that circulation credit can be granted not 
only by the issue of banlmotcs in excess of the banks' holding of cash 
reserves, but also by creating bank deposits subject to check in excess 
of such reserves (checkbook money, deposit currency). Consequently 
it did not realize that deposits payable on demand can also be used as 
a device of credit expansion. This error is of little weight, as it can 
be easily amended. It is enough to stress the point thxt all that rcfcrs 
to credit expansion is valid for all varieties of credit expansion no 
matter whether the additional fiduciary media are banknotes or de- 
posits. However, the teachings of the Currency SchooI inspired British 
legislation designed to prevent the rcturn of credit-expansion booms 
and their necessary consequence, deprcssions, at a time when this 
fundamental dcfect was not yet unmasked. Peel's Act of 184.4 and 
its imitations in other countries did not attain the ends sought, and 
this failure shook the prestige of the Currency School. The Banking 
School triumphed undeservedly. 

The second shortcoming of the Currency Theory was more mo- 
mentous. It rcstricted its reasoning to the problem of the external 
drain. It dealt only with a particular case, viz., credit expansion in one 
country only whiIe there is either no credit expansion or only credit 
expansion to a smaller extent in other areas. This was, by and large, 
sufficient to explain the British crisis of the first part of the nineteenth 
century. But it touched only the surface of the problem. The essential 
question was not raised at all. Nothing was done to clarify the con- 
sequences of a general expansion of credit not confined to a number 
of banks with a restricted clientele. Thc reciprocal relations between 
the supply of moncy (in the broader sense) and the rate of interest 
werc not analyzed. The multifarious projects to lower or to abolish 
interest altogether by means of a banking reform were haughtily 
derided as quackery, but not critically dissected and refuted. The 
nai've presumption of money's neutrality was tacitly ratified. Thus 
a free hand was left to all futile attempts to interpret crises and busi- 
ness fluctuations by means of the theory of direct exchange. hiany 
decades passed before the spell was broken. 

The hindrance that the monctary or circulation credit theory had 

to ovcrcome was not merely theoietical crror but also political bias. 

Public opinion is prone to see in interest nothing but a mcrely institu- 

tional obstacle to the expansion of production. It does not reaIize that 

the discount of future goods as against present goods is a necessary 

and eternal category of human action and cannot be abolished by bank 

manipulation. In tile eyes of cranks and demagogues, interest is a 

product of the sinister machinations of rugged exploiters. The age-old 


Human Action 
disapprobation of interest has been fully revived by modern inter- 
ventionism. It clings to the dogma that it is one of the foremost duties 
of good government to lower the rate of interest as far as possible or 
to abolish it altogether. A11 present-day governments are fanatically 
committed to an easy money policy. As has been mentioned already, 
the British Government has asserted that credit expansion has per- 
formed "the miracle . . . of turning a stone into bread." loA Chair-
man of the Fcderal Reserve Bank of New York has declared that 
"final freedom from the domestic money market exists for every 
sovereign national state where there exists an institution which func- 
tions in the manner of a modern central bank, and whose currency is 
not convertible into gold or into some other commodity." Many 
governments, universities, and institutes of economic research lavishly 
subsidize publications whose main purpose is to praise the blessings 
of unbridled credit expansion and to slander all opponents as ill-
intentioncd advocates of the selfish interests of usurers. 
The wavelike movement affecting the economic system, the re- 
currence of periods of boom which are followed by periods of de- 
pression, is the unavoidable outcome of the attempts, repeated again 
and agin, to lower the gross market rate of interest by means of credit 
expansion. There is no means of avoiding the finaI colfapse of a boom 
brought about by credit expansion. The alternative is only whether 
the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment 
of further credit expansion, or later as a final and total catastrophe of 
the currency system involved. 
The only objection ever raised against the circulation credit theory 
is lame indeed. It has been asserted that the lowering of t+ gross 
market rate of interest below the height it would have reached on an 
unhampered loan market may appear not as the outcome of an in- 
tentional policy on the part of the banks or the monetary authorities 
but as the unintentional effect of their conservatism. Faced with a 
situation which would, when left alone, result in a raise in the market 
rate, the banks refrain from altering the interest they charge on ad- 
vances and thus willy-nilly tumble into expansion.12 These assertions 
are unwarranted. But if we are prepared to admit their correctness 
for the sake of argument, they do not affect at all the essence of the 
monetary explanation of the trade cycle. It is of no concern what the 
particuIar conditions are that induce the banks to expand credit and

12. Machlup (The Stock Market, Credit and Capital Formation, p. 248) calls 
this conduct of the banks "passive inflationism." 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 571 

to underbid the gross market rate of interest which the unhampered 
market would have determined. What counts is solely that the banks 
and the monetary authorities are guided by the idea that the height 
of interest rates as the free loan market determines it is an evil, that it 
is the objective of a good economic poIicy to lower it, and that credit 
expansion is an appropriate means of achieving this end without harm 
to anybody but parasitic moneylenders. It is this infatuation that 
causes them to embark upon ventures which must finally bring about 
the slump. 

If one takes these facts into consideration one could be tempted 
to abstain from any discussion of the problems involved in the frame 
of the theory of the pure market economy and to relegate it to the 
analysis of interventionism, the interference of government with the 
market phenomena. It is beyond doubt that credit expansion is one of 
the primary issues of interventionism. Nevertheless the right place for 
the analysis of the problems involved is not in the theory of intcr- 
ventionism but in that of the pure market economy. For the problem 
we have to deal with is essentially the relation between the supply of 
money and the rate of interest, a problcm of which the consequences 
of credit expansion are only a particular instance. 

Everything that has been asserted with regard to credit expansion is 
equally valid with regard to the effects of any increase in the supply 
of money proper as far as this additional supply reaches the loan 
rnarltet at an early stage of its inflow into the market system. If the 
additional quantity of money increases the quantity of money offered 
for loans at a time when commodity prices and wage rates have not 
yet been completely adjusted to the change in the money relation, 
the effects are no different from those of a credit expansion. In analyz-
ing the problem of credit expansion, c~tallactics completes thc struc- 
ture of the theory of money and of interest. It implicitly demolishes 
the age-old errors concerning interest and explodes the fantastic plans 
to "abolish" interest by means of monetary or credit reform. 

what differentiates credit expansion from an increase in the suppIy 
of money as it can appear in an economy employing only commodity 
money and no fiduciary media at a11 is conditioned by divergences 
in the quantity of the increase and in the temporal sequence of its 
effects on the various parts of the market. Even a rapid increase in the 
production of the precious metals can never have the range which 
credit expansion can attain. The gold standard was an efficacious check 
upon credit expansion, as it forced the banks not to exceed certain 
limits in their expansionist ventures.lThe gold standard's own infla- 

13. Cf. below, p. 472. 

Human Action 

tionary potentialities were kept within limits by the vicissitudes of 
gold mining. Moreover, only a part of the additional gold immediately 
increased the supply offered on the loan market. The greater part 
acted first upon commodity prices and wage rates and affected the 
loan market only at a later stage of the inflationary process. 

However, the continuous increase in the quantity of commodity 
money exercised a steady expansionist pressure on the loan market. 
The gross market rate of interest was, in the course of the last cen- 
turies, continually subject to the impact of an inflow of additional 
money into the loan market. Of course, this pressure for the last 
hundred and fifty years in the Anglo-Saxon countries and for the last 
hundred years in the co~~ntries 

of the European continent, was far 
exceeded by the effects of the synchronous development of circula- 
tion credit as granted by the banks apart from their-from time to 
time reiterated-straightforward endeavors to lower the gross market 
rate of interest by an intensified expansion of credit. Thus three 
tendencies toward a lowering of the gross market rate of interest were 
operating at the same time and strengthening one another. One was 
the outgrowth of the steady increase in the quantity of commodity 
money, the second the outgrowth of a spontaneous development of 
fiduciary media in banking operations, the third the fruit of inten- 
tional anti-interest policies sponsored by the authorities and approved 
by public opinion. It is, of course, impossible to ascertain in a quanti- 
tative way the effect of their joint operation and the contribution of 
each of them; an answer to such a question can only be provided by 
historical understanding. 

What catallactic reasoning can show us is merely that a slight al- 
though continuous pressure on the gross market rate of interest as 
originating from a continuous increase in the quantity of gold, and also 
from a slight increase in the quantity of fiduciary media, which is not 
overdone and intensified by purposeful easy money policy, can be 
counterpoised by the forces of readjustment and accommodation in- 
herent in the market economy. The adaptability of business not pur- 
posely sabotaged by forces extraneous to the market is powerful 
enough to offset the effects which such slight disturbances of the 
loan market can possibly bring about. 

Statisticians have tried to investigate the long- waves of business 
fluctuations with statistical methods. Such attempts are futile. The 
history of modern capitalism is a record of steady economic progress, 
again and again interrupted by feverish booms and their aftermath, 
depressions. It is generally possible to discern statistically these re- 


Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 573 

curring oscilIations from the general trend toward an increase in the 
amount of capital invested and the quantity of products turned out. 
It is impossible to discover any rhythmical fluctuation in the general 
trcnd itself. 

9. 
The Market Economy as Affected by the Recurrence 
of the Trade Cycle 
The popularity of inflation and credit expansion, the ultimate source 
of the repeated attempts to render people prosperous by credit expan- 
sion, and thus the cause of the cyclical fluctuations of business, mani- 
fests itself clearly in the customary terminology. The boom is called 
good business, prosperity, and upswing. Its unavoidable aftermath, the 
readjustment of conditions to the real data of the market, is called 
crisis, slump, bad business, depression. People rebel against the insight 
that the disturbing element is to be seen in the malinvestment and the 
overconsumption of the boom period and that such an artificially 
induccd boom is doomed. They are looking for the philosophers' 
stone to make it last. 

It has been pointed out already in what respect we are free to call 
an improvement in the quality and an increase in the quantity of 
products economic progress. If we apply this yardstick to the various 
phases of the cyclical fluctuations of business, we must call the boom 
retrogression and the depression progress. The boom squanders 
through malinvestment scarce factors of production and reduces the 
stock available through overconsumption; its alleged blessings are 
paid for by impoverishment. The depression, on the other hand, is 
the way back to a state of affairs in which all factors of production 
are em$oyed for the best possible satisfaction of the most urgent 
needs of the consumers. 

Desperate attempts have been made to find in the boom some posi- 
tive contribution to economic progress. Stress has been laid upon the 
role forced saving plays in fostering capital accumulation. The argu- 
ment is vain. It has been shown already that it is very questionable 
whether forced saving can ever achieve more than to counterbalance 
a part of the capital consumption generated by the boom. If those 
praising the allegedly beneficial effects of forced saving were con- 
sistent, they would advocate a fiscal system subsidizing the rich out 
of taxes cbllected from peoplc with modest incomes. The forced 
saving achieved by this method would provide a net increase in the 
amount of capital available without simultaneously bringing about 
capital consumption of a much greater size. 


Human Action

5 74 

Advocates of credit expansion have furthermore emphasized that 
some of the malinvestments made in the boom later become profitable. 
These investments, they say, were made too early, i.e., at a date when 
[he state of the supply of capital goods and the valuations of the con- 
sumers did not yet allow their construction. However, the havoc 
caused was not too bad, as these projects would have been executed 
anyway at a later date. It may be admitted that this description is 
adequate with regard to some instances of rnalinvestment induced 
by a boom. But nobody w-ould dare to assert that the statement is 
correct with regard to all projects whose execution has been en-
couraged by the illusions created by the easy money policy. However 
this may be, it cannot influence the consequences of the boom and 
cannot undo or deaden the ensuing depression. The effects of the 
rnalinvestment appear without regard to whether or not these malin- 
vestments will appear as sound investments at a later time under 
changed conditions. When, in 1845, a railroad was constructed in 
England which would not have been constructed in the absence of 
credit expansion, conditions in the following years were not affected 
by the prospect that in 1870 or 1880 the capital goods required for 
its construction would be available. 'The gain which later resulted 
from the fact that the railroad concerned did not have to be built by 
a frcsh expenditure of capital and labor, was in 1847 no compensation 
for the losses incurred by its premature construction. 

'She boom produces impoverishment. But still more disastrous are 
its moral ravages. It makes people despondent and dispirited. The 
more optimistic they were under the illusory prosperity of the boom, 
the grcater is their despair and their feeling of frustration. The indi- 
vidual is always ready to ascribe his good luck to his own efficicncy 
and to take it as a well-deserved reward for his talent, application, 
and probity. But reverses of fortune he always charges to other 
people, and most of all to the absurdity of social and poIitica1 institu- 
tions. He does not blame the authorities for having fostered the boom. 
He reviles them for the necessary collapse. In the opinion of the 
public, more inflation and more credit expansion are the only remedy 
against the evils which inflation and credit expansion have brought 
about. 

Here, they say, are plants and farms whose capacity to produce is 
either not used at all or not to their full extent. Here are piles of un- 
salable commodities and hosts of unemployed workers. But here are 
also masses of people who would be lucky if they only could satisfy 
their wants more amply. All that is lacking is credit. Additional credit 
would enable the entrepreneurs to resume or to expand production. 


Inte~est, Credit Expmion, the Trade Cycle 575 

The unemployed would find jobs again and could buy the products. 
This reasoning seems pIausible. Nonetheless it is utterly wrong. 

If commodities cannot be sold and worlters cannot find jobs, the 
reason can only be that the prices and wages asked are too high. He 
who wants to sell his inventories or his capacity to work must reduce 
his demand until he finds a buyer. Such is the law of the market. Such 
is the device by means of which the market directs every individual's 
activities into those lines in which they can best contributc to the 
satisfaction of the wants of the consumers. The malinvestments of thc 
boom havc misplaced inconvertible factors of production in some lines 
at the expense of other lines in which they were more urgently needed. 
Thcrc is disproportion in the allocation of nonconvertible factors to 
thc various branches of industry. This disproportion can be remedied 
only by the accun~ulation of new capital and its enlployment in those 
branches in which it is most urgently required. This is a slow process. 
While it is in progress, it is impossible to utilize fully the productive 
capacity of some plants for which the complcmentary production 
facilities are lacking. 

It is vain to object that there is also unused capacity of plants turn- 
ing out goods whose specific character is low. The slack in the sale of 
these goods, it is said, cannot be explained by disproportionality in 
the capital equipment of various branches; they can be used and are 
needed for many different employments. This too is an error. If steel 
and iron works, copper mines, and sawmills cannot be operated to their 
full capacity, the reason can only be that there arc not enough buyers 
on the market ready to purchase their whole output at prices which 
cover the costs of their current exploitation. As the variable costs can 
merely consist in prices of other products and in wages, and as the 
same is valid with rcgard to the prices of these other products, this al- 
ways means that wage rates arc too high to provide all those eager to 
work with jobs and to employ thc inconvertible equipment to the full 
limits drawn by the requirement that nonspecific capital goods and 
labor should not be withdrawn from employments in which they fill 
more urgent needs. 

Out of the collapse of the boom there is only one way back to a 

state of affairs in which progressive accumulation of capital safeguards 

a steady improvement of material well-being: ncw saving must ac- 

cumulate the capital goods needed for a harmonious equipment of 

all branches of production with the capital required. One must provide 

the capita1 goods lacking in those branches which were unduly 

neglected in the boom. Wage rates must drop; people must restrict 

their consumption temporarily untiI the capital wasted by malinvest- 


Human Action 

ment is restored. Those who dislike these hardships of the readjust- 
ment period must abstain in time from credit expansion. 

There is no use in interfering by means of a new credit expansion 
with the process of readjustment. This would at best only interrupt, 
disturb, and prolong the curative process of the depression, if not 
bring about a new boom with all its inevitable consequences. 

The process of readjustment, even in the absence of any new 
credit expansion, is delayed by the psvchological effects of disap- 
pointment and frustration. People are ;low to free themselves from 
the self-deception of delusive prosperity. Businessmen try to continue 
unprofitable projects; they shut their eyes to an insight that hurts. The 
workers delay reducing their claims to the level required by the state 
of the market; they want, if possible, to avoid lowcring thcir standard 
of living and changing their occupation and their dwelling place. 
People are the more discouraged the greater their optimism was in 
the days of the upswing. They have for the moment lost self- 
confidence and the spirit of enterprise to such an extent that they even 
fail to take advantage of good opportunities. But the worst is that 
people are incorrigible. After a few years they embark aneu7 upon 
credit expansion, and the old story repeats itseif. 

The Role Pla.yed by U?2ewzploycd Fxctors of Production 
in the First Stages of n Boom 

There are in the changing economy always unsold inventories (exceed- 
ing those quantities which for technical rcasons must be lrcpt in stock), 
unemployed workers, and unused capacity of inconvertible production 
facilities. The system is moving toward a state in which there wilI be 
neither unemployed workers nor surpIus inventories.14 But as the ap- 
pearance of new data continualIy diverts the course toward a new goal, tht. 
conditions of the evenly rotating economy are never realized. 

The presencc of unuscd capacity of inconvertible investnlents is an out- 
growth of errors committed in the past. Thc assumptions made by the in- 
vestors were, as later events proved, not correct; thc market asks more 
intensively for other goods than for those which these plants can turn out. 
The piIing up of excessivc inventories and the catallactic uncmployment 
of workers are speculative. The owner of the stock refuses to seIl at the 
market price because he hopcs to obtain a higher price at a later date. The 
unemployed worker refuses to change his occupation or his residence or 
to content himself with lower pay because he hopes to obtain at a later date 
a job with higher pay in the place of his rcsidence and in thc branch of busi- 
ness he likes best. Both hesitate to adjust their claims to the present situation 

14. Tn the evenly rotating economy also there may bc unused capacity of in- 
convertible equipment. Its nonutilization does not disturb the equilibrium any 
more than the fallowness of submarginal soil. 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 

of the market because they wait for a change in the data which will alter 
conditions to their advantage. Their hesitation is one of the reasons why 
the system has not reached the state of the evenly rotating economy. 

The advocates of credit expansion argue that what is wanted is more 
fiduciary media. Then the plants will work at full capacity, the inventories 
will be sold at prices their owners consider satisfactory, and the unem- 
ployed will get jobs at wages they consider satisfactory. This very popular 
doctrine implies that the rise in prices, brought about by the additional 
fiduciary ~nedia, would at the same time and to the same extent affect all 
other commodities and services, while the owners of the excessive inven- 
tories and the unemployed workers would content themselves with those 
nominal prices and wages they are asking-in vain, of course-today. For 
if this were to happen, the real prices and the real wage rates obtained by 
these owners of unsold inventories and unemployed workers would drop 
-in proportion to the prices of other commodities and services-to the 
height to which they must drop in order to find buyers and employers. 

The course of the boom is not substantially affected by the fact that at 
its eve there are unused capacity, unsold surplus inventories, and unem- 
ployed workers. Let us assume that there are unused facilities for the min- 
ing of copper, unsold piles of copper, and unemployed workers of copper 
mines. The price of copper is at a level at which mining does not pay for 
some mines; their workers are discharged; there are speculators who ab- 
stain from seiling their stocks. What is needed in order to make these mines 
profitable again, to give jobs to the unemployed, and to sell the piles with- 
out forcing prices down below costs of production, is an increment p in the 
amount of capital goods available large enough to make possible such an 
increase in investment and in the size of production and consumption that 
an adequate rise in the demand for copper ensues. If, however, this incre- 
ment p does not appear and the entrepreneurs, deceived by the credit ex- 
pansion, nevertheless act as if p had really been available, conditions on the 
copper market, while the boom lasts, are as if p had really been added to 
the amount of capital goods available. But everything that has been pred-
icated about the inevitable consequences of credit expansion fits this case 
too. The only difference is that, as far as copper is concerned, the inap- 
propriate expansion of production need not be achieved by the withdrawal 
of cd+d and :&or from emp:oymmts ;[I ivhidi they would better have 
filled the wants of the consumers. As far as copper is concerned, the new 
boom encounters a piece of malinvestment of capital and malemployment 
of labor already effected in a previous boom, which the process of read- 
justment has not yet absorbed. 

Thus it becomes obvious how vain it is to justify a new credit expansion 
by referring to unused capacity, unsoId-or, as people say incorrectly, 
"unsaleab1e"-stocks, and unemployed workers. The beginning of a new 
credit expansion runs across remainders of preceding malinvestment and 
malemploymcnt, not yet obliterated in the course of the readjustment 
process, and seemingly remedies the faults involved. In fact, however, this 


Human Action 

is merely an interruption of the process of readjustment and of the return 
to sound conditions.15 The existence of unuscd capacity and unemploy- 
ment is not a valid argument against the correctness of the circulation 
credit theory. The belief of the advocates of credit expansion and inflation 
that abstention from further credit expansion and inflation would perpet- 
uate the depression is utterly false. The remedies these authors suggest 
would not make the boom last forever. They would merely upset the 
process of recovery. 

The Fallacies of the Nonmonetary Explanations of the Trade Cycle 

In dealing with the futile attempts to explain the cyclical fluctuations of 
business by a nonmonetary doctrine, one point must first of all be stressed 
which has hitherto been unduly neglected. 

There were schools of thought for whom interest was merely a price 
paid for obtaining the disposition of a quantity of money or money sub- 
stitutes. From this belief they quite logically drew the inference that 
abolishing the scarcity of money and money-substitutes would abolish 
interest altogether and result in the gratuitousness of credit. If, however, 
one does not endorse this view and comprehends the nature of originary 
interest, a problem presents itself the treatment of which one must not 
evade. An additional supply of credit, brought about by an increase in the 
quantity of money or fiduciary media, has certainly the power to Iower the 
gross market rate of interest. If interest is not merely a monetary phenorn- 
enon and consequently cannot be lastingly lowered or brushed away by 
any increase, however large, in the supply of money and fiduciary media, 
it devolves upon economics to show how the height of the rate of interest 
conforming to the state of the market's nonmonetary data reestablishes 
itself. It must explain what kind of process removes the cash-induced de- 
viation of the market rate from that state which is consonant with the ratio 
in people's valuation of present and future goods. If economics were at a 
loss to achieve this, it would implicitly admit that interest is a monetary 
phenomenon and could even disappear completely in the course of changes 
in the money relation. 

For the nonmonetary explanations of the trade cycle the experience that 
there are recurrent depressions is the primary thing. Their champions first 
do not see in their scheme of the sequence of economic events any clue 
which could suggest a satisfactory interpretation of these enigmatic dis- 
orders. They desperately search for a makeshift in order to patch it onto 
their teachings as an alleged cycle theory. 

The case is different with the monetary or circulation credit theory. 
Modern monetary theory has finally cleared away all notions of an aIIeged 
neutrality of money. It has proved irrefutably that there are in the market 
economy factors operating about which a doctrine ignorant of the driving 
force of money has nothing to say. The catallactic system that involves the 

15. Hayek (Prices and Production [zd ed. London, 19351, pp. 96ff.) reaches 
the same conclusion by way of a somewhat different chain of reasoning. 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 579 

ltnowledge of money's non-neutrality and driving force presses the ques- 
tions of how changes in the money relation affect the rate of interest first 
in the short run and later in the long run. The system would be defective 
if it could not answer these questions. It would be contradictory if it were 
to provide an answer which would not simultaneousIy explain the cyclical 
Auctuations of trade. Even if there had never been such things as fiduciary 
media and circulation credit, modern catallactics would have been forced 
to raise the problem concerning the relations between changes in the 
money relation and the rate of interest. 

It has been mentioned already that every nonmonetary explanation of 
the cycle is bound to admit that an increase in the quantity of money or 
fiduciary media is an indispensable condition of the emergencc of a boom. 
It is obvious that a general tendency of prices to rise which is not caused by 
a general drop in production and in the supply of comrnoditics offered for 
sale. cannot appear if the supply of money (in the broader sense) has not 
increased. Now we can see that those fighting the monetary explanation 
are also forced to resort to the theory they slander for a second reason. 
For this theory alone answers the question of how an inflow of additional 
money and fiduciary media affects the loan market and the market rate of 
interest. Only those for whom interest is rnereIy the outgrowth of an in- 
stitutionally conditioned scarcity of money can dispcnsc with an implicit 
acknowledgment of the circulation credit theory of the cycle. This explains 
why no critic has ever advanced any tenable objection against this theory. 

The fanaticism with which the supporters of all these nonmonetary 
doctrines refuse to acknowledge their errors is, of coursc, a display of 
political bias. The Marxians have inaugurated the usage of interpreting the 
commercial crisis as an inherent evil of capitalism, as the necessary out- 
growth of its "anarchy" of production.1° The non-Marxian socialists and 
the interventionists are no less anxious to denlonstrate that the market 
economy cannot avoid the return of depressions. They are the more eager 
to assail the monetary theory as currency and credit manipulation is today 
the main instrument by means of which the anticapitalist governments are 
intent upon cstablishing government omnipotence.l7 

The attempts to connect business depressions with cosmic influences, 
the most remarkable of which was William Stanley Jevons' sunspot theory, 
failed utterly. The market economy has succeeded in a fairIy satisfactory 
way in adjusting production and marketing to all the natural conditions of 
human life and its environment. It is quite arbitrary to assume that there is 
just one natural fact-namely, allegedly rhythmic harvest variations- 
with which the market economy does not know how to cope. Why do cn- 
trepreneurs fail to recognize the fact of crop fluctuations and to adjust 
business activities in such a way as to discount their disastrous effects upon 
their plans?

tion theories, cf. above, p. 298.

j80 Human Action 

Guided by the Marxian slogan "anarchy of production," the present-day 
nonmonetary cycle doctrines explain the cyclical fluctuations of trade in 
terms of a tendency, allegedly inherent in the capitalist economy, to de- 
velop disproportionality in the size of investments ~nade in various branches 
of industry. Yet even these disproportionality doctrines do not contest the 
fact that every businessman is eager to avoid such mistakes, which must 
bring him serious financial losses. The essence of the activities of entre- 
preneurs and capitalists is precisely not to embark upon projects which 
they consider unprofitable. If one assumes that there prevails a tendency 
for businessmen to fail in these endeavors, one implies that all businessmen 
are short-sighted. They are too dull to avoid certain pitfalls, and thus 
blunder again and again in their conduct of affairs. The whole of society 
has to foot the bill for the shortcomings of the thick-headed speculators, 
promoters, and entrepreneurs. 

Now it is obvious that men are fallible, and businessmen are certainly not 
free from this human weakness. But one should not forget that on the 
market a process of selection is in continual operation. There prevails an 
unceasing tendency to weed out the less efficient entrepreneurs, that is, 
those who fail in their endeavors to anticipate correctly the future de- 
mands of the consumers. If one group of entrepreneurs produces com- 
modities in excess of the demand of the consumers and consequently 
cannot sell these goods at remunerative prices and suffers losses, other 
groups who produce those things for which the public scrambles make all 
the greater profits. Some sectors of business are distressed while others 
thrive. hTo general depression of trade can emerge. 

But the proponents of the doctrines we have to deal with arguc differ- 
ently. They assume that not only the whole entrepreneuriaI class but all of 
the people are struck with blindness. As the entrepreneurial class is not a 
closed social order to which access is denied to outsiders, as every enter- 
prising man is virtually in a position to challenge those who already belong 
to the class of entrepreneurs. as the history of capitalism provides innumer- 
able examples of penniless newcomers who brilliantly succeeded in em- 
barking upon the production of those goods which according to their own 
judgment were fitted to satisfy the most urgent needs of consumers, the 
assumption that all entrepreneurs regularly fall prey to certain errors 
tacitly implies that all practical Inen lack intelligence. It implies that no- 
body who is engaged in business and nobody who considers engaging in 
business if some opportunity is offered to him by the shortcomings of those 
already engaged in it, is shrewd enough to understand the real state of the 
market. But on the other hand the theorists, who are not themselves active 
in the conduct of affairs and merely phiIosophize about other people's 
actions, consider themselves smart enough to discover the fallacies leading 
astray those doing business. These omniscient professors are never deluded 
by the errors which cloud the judgment of everyone else. They know 
precisely what is wrong with private enterprise. Their claims ro be in- 


Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 

vested with dictatorial powers to control business are therefore fully 
justified. 

The most amazing thing about these doctrines is that they furthermore 
imply that businessmen, in their littleness of mind, obstinately cling to 
their erroneous procedures in spite of the fact that the scholars have long 
since unmasked their faults. Although every textbook explodes them, the 
businessmen cannot help repeating them. There is manifestly no means to 
prevent the recurrence of economic depression other than to entrust-in 
accordance with Plato's utopian ideas-supreme power to the philosophers. 

Let us examine briefly the two most popular varieties of these dispro- 
portionality doctrines. 

There is first the durable goods doctrine. These goods retain their ser- 
viceableness for some time. As long as their life period lasts, the buyer who 
has acquired a piece abstains from replacing it by the purchase of a new 
one. Thus, once all people have made their purchases, the demand for new 
products dwindles. Business becomes bad. A revival is possible only when, 
after the lapse of some time, the old houses, cars, refrigerators, and the like 
are worn out, and their owners must buy new ones. 

However, businessmen are as a rule more provident than this doctrine 
assumes. They are intent upon adjusting the size of their production to the 
anticipated size of consumers' demand. The bakers take account of the fact 
that every day a housewife needs a new loaf of bread, and the manufac- 
turers of coffins take into account the fact that the total annual sale of 
coffins cannot exceed the number of people deceased during this period. 
The machine industry reckons with the average "life" of its products no 
less than do the tailors, the shoemakers, the manufacturers of motorcars, 
radio sets, and refrigerators, and the construction firms. There are, to be 
sure, always promoters who in a mood of deceptive optimism are prone to 
overexpand their enterprises. In the pursuit of such projects they snatch 
away factors of production from other plants of the same industry and 
from other branches of industry. Thus their overexpansion results in a 
relative restriction of output in other fields. One branch goes on expand- 
ing while others shrink until the unprofitability of the former and the 
profitability of the latter rearranges conditions. Both the preceding boon) 
and the following slump concern only a part of business. 

-.
1he second variety of these dlsproport~onallty doctrines is known as the 
acceleration principle. A temporary rise in the demand for a certain com- 
modity results in increased production of the commodity concerned. If, 
then, demand later drops again, the investments made for this expansion 
of production appear as malinvestments. This becomes especially perni- 
cious in the field of durable producers' goods. If the demand for the con- 
sumers' good n increases by 10per cent, business increases the equipment p 
required for its production by 10per cent. The resulting rise in the demand 
for p is the more momentous in proportion to the previous demand for p, 
the longer the duration of serviceableness of a piece of p is and the smaller 


consequently the previous demand for the replacement of worn-out pieces 
of p was. If the life of a piece of p is I o years, the annual demand for p for 
replacement was 10per cent of the stock of p previously employed by the 
industry. The rise of 10per cent in the demand for a doubles therefore the 
demand for p and results in a roo per cent expansion in the equipment r 
needed for the production of p. If then the demand for a stops increasing, 
50 per cent of the production capacity of r remains idle. If the annual in-
crease in the demand for a drops from 10per cent to 5 per cent, 25 per cent 
of the production capacity of r cannot be used. 

The fundamental error of this doctrine is that it considers entrepreneur- 
ial activities as a blindly automatic response to the momentary state of de- 
mand. Whenever demand increases and renders a branch of business more 
profitable, production facilities are supposed instantly to expand in pro- 
portion. This view is untenable. Entrepreneurs often err. They pay heavily 
for their errors. But whoever acted in the way the acceleration principle 
describes would not be an entrepreneur, but a soulless automaton. Yet the 
real entrepreneur is a s~eculiltor,~~

a man eager to utilize his opinion about 
the future structure of the market for business operations promising prof- 
its. This specific anticipative understanding of the conditions of the un- 
certain future defies any rules and systematization. It can be neither taught 
nor learned. If it were different, everybody could embark upon entre- 
preneurship with the same prospect of success. What distinguishes the 
successful entrepreneur and promoter from other people is precisely the 
fact that he does not Iet himself be guided by what was and is, but arranges 
his affairs on the ground of his opinion about the future. He sees the past 
and the present as other people do; but he judges the future in a different 
way. In his actions he is directed by an opinion about the future which 
deviates from those held by the crowd. The impulse of his actions is that 
he appraises the factors of production and the future prices of the com- 
modities which can be produced out of them in a different way from other 
people. If the present structure of prices renders very profitable the busi- 
ness of those who are today selling the articles concerned, their production 
will expand only to the extent that entrepreneurs believe that the favorable 
market constellation will last long enough to make new investments pay. 
If entrepreneurs do not expect this, even very high profits of the enter- 
prises aiready operating wiii not bring about an expansion. It IS exactly thls 
reluctance of the capitalists and entrepreneurs to invest in lines which they 
consider unprofitable that is violently criticized by people who do not 
comprehend the operation of the market economy. Technocratically 
minded engineers complain that the supremacy of the profit motive pre- 
vents consumers from being amply supplied with all those goods with 
which technological knowledge could provide them. Demagogues cry out 
against the greed of capitalists intent upon preserving scarcity. 

18.It is noteworthy that the same term is employed to signify the premedita- 
tion and the ensuing actions of the promoters and cntreprcneurs and the purely 
academic rcasoning of theorists that does not directly result in any action. 

Interest, Credit Expansion, the Trade Cycle 583 

A satisfactory explanation of business fluctuations must not be built upon 
the fact that individual firms or groups of firms misjudge the future state 
of the market and therefore make bad investments. The objective of the 
trade cycle theory is the general upswing of business activities, the propen- 
sity to expand production in all branches of industry, and the following 
general depression. These phenomena cannot be brought about by the fact 
that increased profits in some branches of business result in their expansion 
and a corresponding overproportional investment in the industries manu- 
facturing the equipment needed for such an expansion. 

It is a very well known fact that the more the boom progresses, the 
harder it becomes to buy machines and other equipment. The plants pro- 
ducing these things are overloacled with orders. Their customers must wait 
a long time until the machines ordered are delivered. This clearly shows 
that the producers' goods industries are not so quick in the expansion of 
their own production facilities as the acceleration principle assumes. 

But even if, for the sake of argument, we were ready to admit that capi- 
talists and entrepreneurs behave in the way the disproportionality doctrines 
describe, it remains inexplicabIe how they could go on in the absence of 
credit expansion. The striving after such additional investments raises the 
prices of the complementary factors of production and the rate of interest 
on the loan market. These effects would curb the expansionist tendencies 
very soon if there were no credit expansion. 

The supporters of the disproportionality doctrines refer to certain oc- 
currences in the field of farming as a confirmation of their assertion con-
cerning the inherent lack of provision on the part of private business. How- 
ever, it is impermissible to demonstrate characteristic features of free 
competitive enterprise as operating in the market economy by pointing to 
conditions in the sphere of mcdium-size and small farming. In many coun- 
tries this sphere is institutionally removed from the supremacy of the 
market and the consumers. Government interference is eager to protect the 
farmer against the vicissitudes of the market. These farmers do not operate 
in a free market; they are privileged and pampered by various devices. The 
orbit of their production activities is a reservation, as it were, in which 
technological backwardness, narrow-minded obstinacy, and entrepreneur- 
ial inefficiency are artificially preserved at the expense of the nonagricul- 
turd strata of the people. If they blunder in their conduct of affairs, the 
government forces the consumers, the taxpayers, and the mortgagees to 
foot the bill. 

It is true that there is such a thing as the corn-hog cycle and analogous 
happenings in the production of other farm products. But the recurrence of 
such cycles is due to the fact that the penalties which the market applies 
against inefficient and clumsy entrepreneurs do not affect a great part of 
the farmers. These farmers are not answerable for their actions because 
they are the pet children of governments and politicians. If it were not so, 
they would long since have gone bankrupt and their former farms would 
be operated by more intelligent people. 


XXI. WORK AND WAGES 
1. Introversive Labor and Extroversive Labor 
A 
A 
MAX 111ay overcome the disutility of labor (forego the enjoy- 
ment of leisure) for various reasons. 

r. He may work in order to make his mind and body strong, vigor- 
ous, and agile. The disutility of labor is not a price expended for 
the attainment of these goals; overcoming it is inseparable from the 
contentment sought. The most conspicuous examples are genuine 
sport, practiced without any design for reward and social success; 
the search for truth and knowledge pursued for its own sake and not 
as a means of improving one's own efficiency and skill in the perform- 
ance of other kinds of labor aiming at other ends.l 
2. He may submit to the disutility of labor in order to serve God. 
He sacrifices leisure to please God and to be rewarded in the beyond 
by eternal bliss and in the earthly pilgrimage by the supreme delight 
which the certainty of having complied with all religious duties 
affords. (If, however, he serves God in order to attain worldly ends 
-his daily bread and success in his secular affairs-his conduct does 
not differ substantially from other endeavors to attain mundane ad- 
vantages by expending labor. Whether the theory guiding his conduct 
is correct and whether his expectations will materialize is irrelevant 
to the catallactic qualification of his mode of a~ting.~) 
3. He may toil in order to avoid greater mischief. He submits to 
the disutility of labor in order to forget, to escape from depressing 
thoughts and to banish annoying moods; work for him is, as it were, a 
perfected refinement of play. This refined playing must not be con- 
fused with the simple games of children which are merely pIeasure- 
producing. (However, there are also other children's games. Children 
too are sophisticated enough to indulge in refined play.) 
1. Cognition does not aim at a goal beyond the act of knowing. What satisfies 
the thinker is thinking as such, not obtaining perfect knowledge, a goal inaccessi- 
ble to man. 
2. It is hardly necessary to remark that comparing the craving for knowledge 
and the conduct of a pious life with sport and play does not imply any disparage- 
ment of either. 

Work and Wages 

4, He may work because he prefers the proceeds he can earn by 
working to the disutility of labor and the pleasures of leisure. 

The labor of the classes I, 2, and 3 is expended because the disutility 
of labor in itself-and not its product-satisfies. One toils and troubles 
not in order to reach a goal at the termination of the march, but for 
the very sake of marching. The mountain-clirnber does not want 
simply to reach the peak, he wants to reach it by climbing. He disdains 
the rack railway which would bring him to the summit more quickly 
and without trouble even though the fare is cheaper than the costs 
incurred by climbing (e.g., the guide's fee). The toil of climbing 
does not gratify him immediately; it involves disutility of labor. But 
it is precisely overcoming the disutility of labor that satisfies him. A 
less exerting ascent would please him not better, but less. 

Wc may call the labor of classes I, 2, and 3 introversive labor and 
distinguish it from the extroversive labor of class 4. In some cases 
introversive labor may bring about-as a by-product as it were- 
results for the attainment of which other people would submit to the 
disutility of labor. The devout may nurse sick people for a heavenly 
reward; the truth seeker, exclusively devoted to the search for 
knowledge, may discover a practically useful device. To this extent 
introversive labor may influence the supply on the market. But as a 
rule catallactics is concerned only with extroversive labor. 

The psychological problems raised by introversive labor are catal- 
lactically irrelevant. Seen from the point of view of economics intra- 
versive labor is to be qualified as consumption. Its performance as a 
rule requires not only the personal efforts of the individuals con- 
cerned, but also the expenditure of material factors of production and 
the produce of other peoples' extroversive, not immediately gratify- 
ing labor that must be bought by the payment of wages. The practice 
of religion requires places of worship and their equipment; sport 
requires diverse utensils and apparatus, trainers and coaches. All 
these things beIong in the orbit of consumption. 

2. Joy and Tedium of Labor 
Only extroversive, not immediately gratifying labor is a topic of 
catallactic disquisition. The dlaracteristic mark of this kind of labor 
is that it is performed for the sake of an end which is beyond its per- 
formance and the disutility which it involves. PeopIe work because 
they want to reap the produce of labor. The labor itseIf causes dis- 
utility. But apart from this disutility which is irksome and would en-
join upon man the urge to economize labor even if his power to work 


were not limited and he were able to perform unlimited work, special 
emotional phenomena sometimes appear, fcelings of joy or tedium, 
accompanying the execution of certain kinds of labor. 

Both, the joy and the tedium of labor, are in a dornain other than the 
disutility of labor. The joy of labor therefore can neither alleviate 
nor remove the disutility of labor. Kcither must the joy of labor be 
confused with the immediate gratification provided by certain kinds 
of work. It is an attendant phenomenon which proceeds either from 
labor's mediate gratification, the produce or reward, or from some 
accessory circumstances. 

People do not submit to the disutility of labor for the sake of the joy 
which accompanies the labor, but for the sake of its mediate gratifica- 
tion. In fact the joy of labor presupposes for the most part the dis- 
utility of the labor concerned. 

The sources from which the joy of labor springs are: 

I. Thc expectation of the labor's mediate gratification, the antici- 
pation of the enjoyment of its success and yield. The toiler looks at his 
work as a means for the attainment of an end sought, and the progress 
of his work delights him as an approach toward his goal. His joy 
is a foretaste of the satisfaction conveyed by the mediate gratification. 
In the frame of social cooperation this joy manifests itself in the con- 
tentment of being capable of holding one's ground in the social or- 
ganism and of rendering services which one's fellowmen appreciate 
eithcr in buying thc product or in remunerating the labor expcnded. 
The worker rcjoices because he gets self-respect and the consciousness 
of supporting himself and his family and not being dependent on other 
people's mercy. 
2. In the pursuit of his work the workcr enjoys the aesthetic ap- 
preciation of his skill and its product. This is not merely the con- 
templative pleasure of the man who views things performed by other 
people. It is the pride of a man who is in a position to say: I know 
how to make such things, this is my work. 
3. Having completed a task the worker enjoys the feeling of hav- 
ing successfully overcome all the toil and troublc involved. He is 
happy in being rid of something difficult, unpleasant, and painful, in 
being relieved for a certain time of the disutility of labor. His is the 
feeline of "I have done it." 
3

4. Some kinds of work satisfy particular wishes. There are, for ex- 
ample, occupations which meet erotic desires-either conscious or 
subconscious ones. These desires may be normal or perverse. Also 
fetishists, homosexuals, sadists and other perverts can sometimes find 
in their work an opportunity to satisfy their strange appetites. There 

Work and Wages 

587 

arc occupations which arc cspecially attractive to such people. Cruelty 
and bIood-thirstiness luxuriantly thrive under various occupationd 
cloaks. 

The various kinds of work offer difierent conditions for the ap- 
pcarance of thc joy of labor. Thcse conditions may be by and largc 
n1oJ-e homogeneous in classes I and 3 than in class 2. It is obvious that 
they are more rarely present for class 4. 

The joy of labor can be cntircIy abscnt. Psychical factors may 
clin~inatc;t altogether. On the othcr hand one can prposel; aim at 
increasing thc joy of lahor. 

Keen disccrncrs of the human soul have always been intent upon 
e~~hancing

the joy of labor. A grcat part of the achievements of the 
organizers and leadcrs of armies of mercenaries belongcd to this field. 
Their task was easy as far as the profession of arms provides the 
satisfactions of class 4. However, these satisfactions do not depend 
on the arms-bearer's Ioyalty. They also come to the soldier who leaves 
his war-lord in the lurch and turns against him in the service of new 
Icadcrs. Thus the particular task of the employcrs of nlcrcenaries was 
to promote an esprit dc corps and loyalty that could render their hire- 
lings proof against temptations. There were also, of course, chiefs who 
did not bother about such irnpalpablc matters. In the armies and navies 
of the eighteenth century the only rncans of securing obedience and 
preventing desertion wcre barbarous punishments. 

Modern ir~dustrialism uas not intent upon designedly increasing 

the joy of labor. It relied upon thc material improvenlent that it 

brought to its crnployees in their capacity as wage earners as wcll 

as in their capacity as consumers and buyers of the products. In view 

of the fact that job-seclrers thronged to the plants and cvcrvone 

scrambled for the inanufactures, there secmcd to bc no need to risort 

to special devices. 3he benefits which the masses dcrired from the 

capitalist system were so obvious that no cntrepreneur considered it 

necessary to harangue the worlters with procapitalist propaganda. 

R4odern capitalism is essentially mass production for thc ncecls of the 

masses. The buyers of the products are by and large the same pcople 

who as wage earners cooperate in their manufacturing. Rising sales 

provided dependable information to the employer about the improvc- 

rncnt of the masses' standard of living. Hc did not bother about the 

feclings of his cmplovees as vr~orltcrs. He was cxcIusivcly intent upon 

serving them as consumcrs. Even today, in face of thc most persistent 

and fanatical anticapitali\t propagmda, there is hardly any counter- 

propaganda. 

This anticapitalist propaganda is a systematic scheme for the sub- 


588 Human Action 
stitution of tedium for the joy of labor. The joy of labor of classes 
I and 2 depends to some extent on ideological factors. The worker 
rejoices in his place in society and his active cooperation in its pro- 
ductive effort. If one disparages this ideology and replaces it by 
another which represents the wage earner as the distressed victim 
of ruthless exploiters, one turns the joy of labor into a feeling of 
disgust and tedium. 
No ideology, however jmpressively emphasized and taught, can 
affect the disutility of labor. It is impossible to remove or to alleviate 
it by persuasion or hypnotic suggestion. On thc other hand it cannot 
be increased by words and doctrines. The disutility of labor is a 
phenomenon unconditionally given. The spontaneous and carefree 
discharge of one's own energies and vital functions in aimless freedom 
suits everybody better than the stern restraint of purposive effort. 
The disutility of labor also pains a man who with heart and soul and 
even with seIf-denial is devoted to his work. He too is eager to reduce 
the lump of labor if it can be done without prejudice to the mediate 
gratification expected, and he enjoys the joy of labor of class 3. 
However, the joy of labor of classes I and 2 and somctinlcs even that 
of class 3 can be eIiminated by ideological influences and be replaced 
by the tedium of labor. The worker begins to hate his work if he 
becomes convinced that what makes him submit to the disutility of 
labor is not his own higher valuation of the stipulated compensation, 
but merely an unfair social system. Deluded by the slogans of the 
socialist propagandists, he fails to realize that the disutility of labor is 
an inexorable fact of human conditions, something uItimatcly given 
that cannot be removed by devices or methods of social organization. 
He falls prey to the Marxian fallacy that in a socialist commonwealth 
work will arouse not pain but pleas~re.~ 
The fact that the tedium of labor is substituted for the joy of labor 
affects the valuation neither of the disutility of labor nor of the prod- 
uce of labor. Both the demand for labor and the supply of labor 
remain unchanged. For people do not work for the sake of labor's 
joy, but for the sake of the rnediate gratification. What is altered is 
merely the worker's emotional attitude. His work, his position in the 
cornpiex of the social division of labor, his relations to other members 
of society and to the whole of society appear to him in a new light. He 
pities himself as the defenseless victim of an absurd and unjust system. 
He becomes an ill-humored grumbler, an unbalanced personality, an 
easy prey to all sorts of quacks and cranks. To be joyful in the per-

formance of one's tasks and in overcoming the disutility of labor 
makes people cheerful and strengthens their energies and vital forces. 
To feel tedium in working makes people morose and neurotic. A 
commonwealth in which the tedium of labor prevails is an assemblage 
of rancorous, quarrelsome, and wrathful malcontents. 

However, with regard to the volitionaI springs for overcoming the 
disutility of labor, the role played by the joy and the tedium of labor 
is merely accidental and supererogatory. There cannot be any question 
of making people work for the mere sake of the joy of labor. The joy 
of labor is no substitute for the mediate gratification of labor. The only 
means of inducing a man to work more and better is to offer him a 
higher reward. It is vain to bait him with the joy of labor. When the 
dictators of Soviet Russia, hlazi Germany, and Fascist Italy tried to 
assign to the joy of labor a definite function in their system of produc- 
tion, they saw their expectations blighted. 

Neither the joy nor the tedium of labor ran influence the amount 
of labor offered on the market. ,4s far as these feelings are present 
with the same intensity in all kinds of work, the case is obvious. But 
it is the same with regard to joy and tedium which are conditioned 
by the particular features of the work concerned or the particular 
character of the worker. 1,et us look, for example, at the joy of class 

4. The eagerness of certain people to get jobs which offer an oppor- 
tunity for the enjoyment of these particular satisfactions tends to 
lower wage rates in this field. But it is precisely this effect that makes 
other people, less responsive to these questionable pleasures, prefer 
other sectors of the labor market in which they can earn more. Thus 
an opposite tendency develops which neutralizes the first one. 
The joy and the tedium of labor are psychological phenomena 
which influence neither the individual's subjective valuation of the 
disutility and the mediate gratification of labor nor the price paid 
for labor on the market. 

3. Wages 
Labor is a scarce factor of production. As such it is sold and bought 

on the market. The price paid for labor is included in the price allowed 

for the product or the services if the performer of the work is the 

seller of the product or the services. If bare labor is sold and bought 

as such, either by an entrepreneur engaged in production for sale or 

by a consumer eager to use the services rendered for his own consump- 

tion, the price paid is called wages. 

For acting man his own labor is not merely a factor of production 


Human Action 
but also the source of disutility; he values it not only with regard to 
the mediate gratification expected but also with regard to the dis- 
utility it causes. But for him, as for everyone, other people's labor as 
offered for sale on the market is nothing but a factor of production. 
Man deals with other people's labor in the same way that he deals with 
all scarce material factors of production. He appraises it according 
to the principles he applies in the appraisal of all other goods. The 
height of wage rates is determined on the market in the same way in 
which the prices of all commodities are determined. In this sensk we 
may say that labor is a commodity. The emotional associations which 
people, under the influence of Marxism, attach to this term do not 
matter. It suffices to observe incidentally that the employers deal with 
labor as they do with commodities because the conduct of the con- 
sumers forces them to proceed in this way. 
It is not permissible to speak of labor and wages in general without 
resorting to certain restrictions. A uniform type of labor or a general 
rate of wages do not exist. Labor is very different in quality, and 
each kind of labor renders specific services. Each is appraised as 3 
complementary factor for turning out definite consumers' goods and 
services. Between the appraisal of the performance of a surgeon and 
that of a stevedore there is no direct connection. But indirectIy each 
sector of the labor ~narket is connected with all other sectors. An in- 
crease in the demand for surgical services, however great, will not 
make stevedores flock into the practice of surgery. Yet the lines be- 
tween the various sectors of the labor market are not sharply drawn. 
There prevails a continuous tendency for workers to shift from their 
branch to other similar occupations in which conditions seen1 to offer 
better opportunities. Thus finally every change in demand or supply 
in one sector affects all other sectors indirectly. All groups indirectlv 
compete with one another. If more people enter the medical 
sion, men are withdrawn from kindred occupations who again are 
replaced by an inflow of people from other branches and so on. In 
thls sense there exists a connexity between aii occupationai groups 
however different the requirements in each of them may be. There 
again we are faced with the fact that the disparity in the quality of 
work needed for the satisfaction of wants is geateE than the diversity 
in men's inborn ability to perform work.4 
Connexity exists not only between different types of labor and 
the prices paid for them bit no less between labor and the material 
factors of production. Within certain limits labor can be substituted 
for material factors of production and vice versa. The extent that such 

4. Cf. above, pp. 133-135. 

Work and Wages 

substitutions are resorted to depends on the height of wage rates and 
the prices of material factors. 

The determination of wage rates-like that of the prices of material 
factors of production-can be achieved only on the market. There 
is no such thing as nonmarket wage rates, just as there are no non- 
market prices. As far as there are wages, labor is deaIt with like any 
material factor of production and sold and bought on the market. It 
is usual to call the sector of the market of producers' goods on which 
labor is hired the labor market. As with all other sectors of the market, 
the labor market is actuated by the entrepreneurs intent upon making 
profits. Each entrepreneur is eager to buy all the kinds of specific labor 
he needs for the realization of his planswat the cheapest price. But the 
wages he offers nlmt be high enough to take the workers away from 
competing entrepreneurs. The upper limit of his bidding is determined 
by anticipation of the price he can obtain for the increment in salable 
goods he expects from the employment of the worker concerned. 
The lower limit is determined by the bids of competing entrepreneurs 
who themselves are guided by analogous considerations. It is this that 
economists have in mind in asserting that the height of wage rates for 
each kind of labor is determined by its marginal productivity. An- 
other way to express the same truth is to say that wage rates are de- 
termined by the supply of labor and of material factors of production 
on the one hand and by the anticipated future prices of the consumers' 
goods. 

This catallactic explanation of the determination of wage rates has 
been the target of passionate but entirely erroneous attacks. It has 
been asserted that there is a monopoly of the demand for labor. Most 
of the supporters of this doctrine think that they have sufficiently 
proved their case by referring to some incidental remarks of Adam 
Smith concerning "a sort of tacit but constant and uniform combina- 
tion" among emphyers to keep wages down.5 Others refer in vague 
terms to the existence of trade associations of various groups of busi- 
nessmen. The emptiness of all this talk is evident. However, the fact 
that these garbled ideas are the main ideological foundation of labor 
unionism and the labor policy of all contemporary governments makes 
it necessary to analyze them with the utmost care. 

The entrepreneurs are in the same position with regard to the sellers 
of labor as they are with regard to the sellers of the ~naterial factors of 
production. They are under the necessity of acquiring all factors of 

5. Cf. Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the M7ealth of 
Nations (Basle, 1791),vol. I, Bk. I, chap. viii, p. loo. Adam Smith himself seems 
to have unconsciously given up the idea. Cf. W. H. Hutt, The Tl~eory of Collec- 
tive Bargaining (London, 1930),pp. 24-25. 

Human Actio~ 

production at the cheapest price. But if in the pursuit of this en- 
deavor some entrepreneurs, certain groups of entrepreneurs, or all 
entrepreneurs offer prices or wage rates which are too low, i.e., do not 
agree with the state of the unhampered market, they will succeed 
in acquiring what they want to acquire only if entrance into the 
ranks of entrepreneurship is blocked through institutional barriers. 
If the emergence of new entrepreneurs or the expansion of the activi- 
ties of already operating entrepreneurs is not prevented, any drop 
in the prices of factors of production not consonant with the structure 
of the market must open new chances for the earning of profits. There 
will be ~eople eager to take advantage of the margin between the 
prevailing wage rate and the marginal productivity of labor. Their 
demand for labor will bring wage rates back to the hcight conditioned 
by labor's marginal productivity. The tacit combination among the 
employers to which Adam Smith referred, even if it cxistcd, could 
not lower wages below the competitive market rate unless access to 
entrepreneurship required not only brains and capital (the latter al- 
ways available to enterprises promising the highest returns), bat in 
addition also an institutional title, a patent, or a license, rcserved to 
a class of privileged people. 

It has been asserted that a job-seeker must sell his labor at any price, 
however low, as he depends excIusively on his capacity to work and 
has no other source of income. He cannot wait and is forced to content 
himself with any reward the employers are kind enough to offer him. 
This inherent weakness makes it easy for the concerted action of the 
masters to lower wage rates. They can, if need be, wait longer, as 
their demand for labor is not so urgent as the worker's demand for 
subsistence. The argument is defective. It takes it for granted that the 
employers pocket the difference between the marginal-productivity 
wage rate and the lower monopoly rate as an extra monopoly gain and 
do not pass it on to the consumers in the form of a reduction in prices. 
For if they were to reduce prices according to the drop in costs of 
production, they, in their capacity of entrepreneurs and sellers of 
the products, would derive no advantage from cutting wages. The 
whole gain would go to the consumers and thereby also to the wage- 
earners in thcir capacity as buyers; the entrepreneurs themselves would 
be benefited only as consumers. However, to rctain the extra profit 
resulting from the "exploitation" of the workers' poor bargaining 
power would require concerted action on the part of employers in 
their capacity as sellers of the products. It would require a universal 
monopolv of all kinds of production activities which can he cre-


Work and Wages 

593 

ated only by an institutional restriction of access to entrepreneurship. 

The cssential point of the mattcr is that the alleged monopolistic 
combination of the en~ployers about which Adam Smith and a great 
part of public opinion speak would be a monopoly of demand. But 
we have already seen that such alleged monopolies of demand are in 
fact nlonopolies of supply of a particular character. The employers 
would be in a position enabling them to lower wage rates by concerted 
action only if they were to ~nonopolize a factor indispensable for 
every kind of production and ro restrict the employment of this factor 
in a monopolistic way. As thcre is no single material factor indispen- 
sable for every kind of ~roduction, they would have to nlonopolize 
all material factors of production. This condition would be present 
only in a socialist community, in which there is neither a market 
nor prices and wage rates. 

Neither would it be possible for the proprietors of the material 
factors of production, the capitalists and the landowners, to combine 
in a universal cartel against the interests of the workers. The character- 
istic mark of production activities in the past: and in the forcseeable 
future is that the scarcity of labor exceeds t:hc scarcity of most of 
the primary, nature-given material factors of production. The com- 
paratively greater scarcity of labor determines the extent to which 
the comparatively abundant primary natural factors can be utilized. 
There is unused soil, there are unused mineral deposits and so on be- 
cause there is not enough labor available for their utilization. If the 
owners of the soil that is tilled today were to form a cartel in order to 
reap monopoly gains, their plans would be frustrated by the compe- 
tition of the owners of the submarginal land. The owners of the 
produced factors of production in their turn could not combine in a 
comprehensive cartel without the cooperation of the owners of the 
primary factors. 

Various other objections have been advanced against the doctrine 

of the monopolistic exploitation of labor by a tacit or avowed com- 

bine of the employers. It has been demonstrated that at no time and 

at no place in the unhampered market economy can the existence of 

such cartels be discovered. It has been shown that it is not true that 

the job-seekers cannot wait and are therefore under the necessity of 

accepting any wage rates, however low, offered to them by the em- 

ployers. It isnot true that every unemployed worker is faced with 

starvation; the workers too have reserves and can wait; the proof is 

that they really do wait. On the other hand waiting can be financially 

ruinous to the entrepreneurs and capitalists too. If they cannot ernploir 


Human Action 

their capital, they suffer losses. Thus all the disquisitions about an 
alleged "employers' advantage" and "workers' disadvantage" in bar- 
gaining are without sub~tance.~ 

But these are secondary and accidental considerations. The central 
fact is that a monopoly of the demand for labor cannot and does not 
exist in an unhampered market economy. It could originate only as 
an outgrowth of institutional restrictions of access to entrepreneur- 
ship. 

Yet one point must be stressed. The doctrine of the monopolistic 
manipulation of wage rates by the employers speaks of labor as if it 
were a homogeneous entity. It deals with such concepts as demand 
for "labor in general" and supply of "labor in general." But such 
notions have, as has been pointed out already, no counterpart in 
reality. What is sold and bought on the labor market is not "labor in 
generd," but definite specific labor suitable to render definite services. 
Each entrepreneur is in search of workers who are fitted to accomplish 
those specific tasks which he needs for the execution of his plans. He 
must withdraw these specialists from the employments in which they 
happen to work at the moment. The only means he has to achieve 
this is to offer them higher pay. Every innovation which an entre- 
preneur plans-the production of a new article, the application of a 
new process of production, the choice of a new location for a specific 
branch or simply the expansion of production already in existence 
either in his own enterprise or in other enterprises-requires the 
employment of worlrcrs hitherto engaged somewhere else. The entre- 
preneurs are not merely faced with a shortage of "labor in generaI," 
but with a shortage of those specific types of labor they need for 
their plants. The competition among the entrepreneurs in bidding for 
the most suitable hands is no less keen than their competition in bidding 
for the required raw materials, tools, and machines and in their bidding 
for capital on the capital and loan market. The expansion of the activi- 
ties of the individual firms as well as of the whole society is not only

..

l~mited by the amount of capitai goods avaiiabie and of the suppiy 
of "labor in general." In each branch of production it is also limited 
by the available supply of specialists. This is7 of course, only a tem-
porary obstacle which vanishes in the long run when more workers, 
attracted by the higher pay of the specialists in comparatively under- 
manned branches, will have trained themselves for the special tasks 
concerned. Rut in the changing economy such a scarcity of specialists 

6. All these and many other points are carefully anaIyzed by Hutt, op. cit., 
PP. 35-72. 

Work and Wages 

emerges anew daily and determines the conduct of employers in 
their search for workers. 

Every employer must aim at buying the factors of production 
needed, inclusive of labor, at the cheapest price. An employer who 
paid more than agrees with the market price of the services his em- 
ployees render him, would be soon removed from his entrepreneurial 
position. On the other hand an employer who tried to reduce wage 
rates below the height consonant with the marginal productivity of 
labor would not recruit the type of men that the most efficient utiliza- 
tion of his equipment requires. There prevails an inevitable tendency 
for wage rates to reach the point at which they are equal to the price 
of the marginal product of the kind of labor in question. If wage 
rates drop below this point, the gain derived from the employment 
of every additional worker will increase the demand for labor and thus 
make wage rates rise again. If wage rates rise above this point, the 
loss incurred from the employment of every worker will force the 
employers to discharge workers. The competition of the unemployed 
for jobs will create a tendency for wage rates to drop. 

4. Catallactic Unemployment 
If a job-seeker cannot obtain the position he prefers, he must look 
for another kind of job. If he cannot find an employer ready to pay 
him as much as he would like to earn, he must abate his pretensions. If 
he refuses, he will not get any job. He remains unemployed. 

What causes unen~ployment is the fact that-contrary to the above- 
mentioned doctrine of the worker's inability to wait-those eager to 
earn wages can and do wait. A job-seeker who does not want to wait 
will always get a job in the unhampered market economy in which 
there is aIways unused capacity of natural resources and very often 
also unused capacity of produced factors of production. It is only 
necessary for him either to reduce the amount of pay he is asking fir 
or to alter his occupation or his place of work. 

There were and still are people who work only for some time and 
then live for another period from the savings they have accumulated 
by working. In countries in which the cultural state of the masses 
is low, it is often difficult to recruit workers who are ready to stay 
on the job. The average man there is so callous and inert that he knows 
of no other use for his earnings than to buy some leisure time. He 
works only in order to remain unemployed for some time. 

It is different in the civiIized countries. Here the worker looks 


596 Human Action 
upon unen~ployment as an evil. He would like to avoid it provided 
the sacrifice required is not too grievous. He chooses between employ- 
ment and unemployment in the same way in which he proceeds in all 
othcr actions and choices: he weighs the pros and cons. If he chooses 
unemployment, this unemployment is a market phenomenon whose 
nature is not different from other market phcnomena as they appear 
in a changing market economy. We may call this kind of unemploy- 
ment market-generated or catallactic unemployment. 
The various considerations which maj7 induce a man to decide for 
unemployment can be classified in this way: 

I. The individual believes that he will find at a later date a rc- 
inunerative job in his dwelling place and in an occupation which he 
likes better and for which he has been trained. He seeks to avoid the 
expenditure and other disadvantages involved in shifting from one 
occupation to another and from one geographical to another. 
There may be special conditions increasing these costs. A worker who 
owns a homestead is more firmly linked with the place of his residence 
than people living in rented apartments. A married woman is less 
mobile than an unrnarricd girl. Then there are occupations which im-
pair the worker's ability to resume his previous job at a later date. 
A watchmaker who works for some time as a lumberman may lose 
the dexterity required for his previous job. In all thesc cases the 
iildivid~~al
chooses temporary unemployment because he believes that 
this choice pays better in the long run. 

2. There are occupations the demand for which is subject to con- 
siderable seasonal variations. In somc months of the year the demand 
is very intense, in other months it dwindlcs or disappears altogether. 
The structure of wage rates discounts thesc seasonal fluctuations. 
The branches of industry subject to them can compete on the labor 
market only if the wages they pay in the good season are high enough 
to indemnify the wage earners for the disadvantagcs resulting from the 
seasonal irregularity in demand. Then many of the workcrs, having

JLLV~LL 

employed in the had season. 

3. The individual chooses temporary unemployment for considera- 
tions which in popular speech are calIed'noneconomic or even irra- 
tionaI. He does not take jobs which are incompatible with his reli- 
gious, moral, and political convictions. He shuns occupations the 
exercise of which would impair his social prestige. He lets himself be 
guided by traditional standards of what is proper for a gentleman and 
what is unworthy. He does not want to lose face or caste. 
Unemployment in the unhampered market is always voluntary. 


Work and Wages 

597 


In the eyes of the unemployed man, unempIoynient is the minor 
of two evils between which he has to choose. The structure of the 
market may sometimes cause wage rates to drop. But, on the un- 
hampered market, there is always for each type of Iabor a rate at 
which all those eager to work can get a job. The final wage rate is 
that rate at which all job-seekers get jobs and all employers as many 
workers as they want to hire. Its height is determined by the marginal 
productivity of each type of work. 

Wage rate fluctuations are the device by means of which the 
sovcreignty of the consumers manifests itself on the labor market. 
They are the measure adopted for the allocation of labor to the various 
branches of productior~. They penalizc disobedience by cutting wagc 
rates in the comparatively overmanned branches and recompense 
obedience by raising u,age rates in the comparatively undcrrnanned 
branches. They thus submit the individual to a harsh social pressure. 
It is obvious that they indirectly limit the individual's freedom to 
choose his occupation. Rut this coercion is not rigid. It leaves to the 
individual a margin in the limits of which he can choose 1)etween what 
suits him better and what less. Within this orbit he is free to act of 
his own accord. This amount of freedom is the maximum of freedom 
that an individual can enjoy in the framework of the social division 
of labor, and this amount of coercion is the minimum of coercion 
that is indispensable for the preservation of the system of social co- 
operation. There is only one alternative left to the catallactic pressure 
exercised by the wages system: the assignment of occupations and 
jobs to each individual by the peremptory decrees of an authority, 
a central board planning all production acitivities. This is tantamount 
to the suppression of all freedom. 

It is true that under the wages system the individual is not free to 

choose permanent unemployment. Gut no other imaginable social 

system could grant him a right to unIimited leisure. That man cannot 

avoid submitting to the disutility of labor is not an outgrowth of any 

social institution. It is an inescapable natural condition of human life 

and conduct. 

It is not expedient ro call catallactic unenlployment in a metaphor 

borrowed from mechanics "frictional" unemployment. In the 

imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy there is no 

unemployment because we have based this construction on such an 

assumption. Unemployment is a phenomenon of a changing economy. 

The fact that a worker discharged on account of changes occurring 

in the arrangement of production processes does not instantly take 

advantage of every opportunity to get another job but waits for a 


Human Action 

more propitious opportunity is not a consequence of the tardiness of 
the adjustment to the change in conditions, bnt is one of the factors 
slowing down the pace of thls adjustment. It is not an automatic reac- 
tion to the changes which have occurred, independent of the will and 
the choices of the job-seekers concerned, but the effect of their inten- 
tional actions. It is speculative, not frictional. 

Catallactic unemployment must not be confused with institutional 
z~nemployment.Institutional unemployment is not the outcome of 
the decisions of the individuaI job-seekers. It is the effect of inter- 
ference with the market phenomena intent upon enforcing by co- 
ercion and compulsion wage rates higher than those the unhampered 
market would have determined. 'The treatment of institutional un- 
employment belongs to the analysis of the problems of intervention- 
ism. 

5. Gross Wage Rates and Net Wage Rates 
What the employer buys on the labor market and what he gets 
in exchange for the wages paid is always a definite performance which 
he appraises according to its market price. The customs and usages 
prevailing on the various sectors of the labor market do not influence 
the prices paid for definite quantities of specific performances. Gross 
wage rates always tend toward the point at which they are equal 
to the price for which the increment resulting from the employment 
of the marginal worker can be sold on the market, due allowance being 
made for the price of the required materials and to originary interest 
on the capital needed. 

In weighing the pros and cons of the hiring of workers the em- 
ployer does not ask himseIf what the worker gets as take-home wages. 
The only relevant question for him is: What is the total price I have 
to expend for securing the services of this worker? In speaking of 
the determination of wage rates catallactics always refers to the total 
price which the employer must spend for a definite quantity of work 
of a definite type, i.e., to gross wage rates. If laws or business customs 
force the employer to make other expenditures besides the wages 
he pays to the employee, the take-home wages are reduced accord- 
ingly. Such accessory expenditures do not affect the gross rate of 
wages. Their incidence falls entirely upon the wage-earner. Their 
total amount reduces the height of take-home wages, is., of net 
wage rates. 

It is necessary to realize the following consequences of this state of 

affairs: 

I. It does not matter whether wages are time wages or piecework 

Work and Wages 

599 

wages. Also where there are time wages, the employek takes only one 
thing into account; namely, the average performance he expects to 
obtain from each worker employed. His calculation discounts all the 
opportunities time work offers to shirkers and cheaters. He discharges 
workers who do not perform the minimum expected. On the other 
hand a worker eager to earn more must either shift to piecework or 
seek a job in which pay is higher because the minimum of achievement 
expected is greater. 

Neither does it matter on an unhampered labor market whether time 
wages are paid daily, weekly, monthly, or as annual wages. It does 
not matter whether the time allowed for notice of discharge is longer 
or shorter, whether agreements are made for definite periods or for 
the worker's life time, whether the employee is entitled to retirement 
and a pension for himseIf, his widow, and his orphans, to paid or un- 
paid vacations, to certain assistance in case of illness or invalidism or 
to any other benefits and privileges. The question the employer faces 
is always the same: Does it or does it not pay for me to enter into such 
a contract? Don't I pay too much for what I am getting in return? 

2. Consequently the incidence of all so-called social burdens and 
gains ultimately falls upon the worker's net wage rates. It is irrelevant 
whether or not the employer is entitled to deduct the contributions 
to all kinds 'of social security from the wages he pays in cash to the 
employee. At any rate these contributions burden the employee, not 
the employer. 
3. The same holds true with regard to taxes on wages. Here too 
it does not matter whether the employer has or has not the right to 
deduct them from take-home wages. 
4. Neither is a shortening of the hours of work a free gift to the 
worker. If he does not compensate for the shorter hours of work by 
increasing his output accordingly, time wages will drop correspond- 
ingly. If the law decreeing a shortening of the hours of work pro- 
hibits such a reduction in wage rates, all the consequences of a 
government-decreed rise in wage rates appear. The same is valid with 
regard to all other so-called social gains, such as paid vacations and 
SO on. 
5. If the government grants to the employer a subsidy for the 
employment of certain classes of workers, their take-home wages are 
increased by the total amount of such a subsidy. 
6. If the authorities grant to every employed worker whose own 
earnings lag behind a certain minimum standard an allowance raising 
his income to this minimum, the height of wage rates is not directly 
affected. Indirectly a drop in wage rates could possibly result as far

as this system c'ould induce people who did not work before to seek 
jobs and thus bring about an increase in the supply of labor.' 

6. Wages and Subsistence 
The life of primitive man was an unceasing struggle against the 
scantiness of the nature-given means for his sustenance. In this des- 
perate effort to secure bare survival, many individuals and whole 
families, tribes, and races succumbed. Primitive man was always 
haunted by the specter of death from starvation. Civilization has freed 
us from these perils. Human life is menaced day and night by innumer- 
able dangers; it can be destroyed at any instant by natural forces 
which are beyond control or at least cannot be controlled at the 
present stage of our knowledge and our potentialities. But the horror 
of starvation no longer terrifies people living in a capitalist society. 
He who is able to work earns much more than is needed for bare 
sustenance. 

There are also, of course, disabled people who are incapable of 
work. Then there are invalids who can perform a small quantity of 
work; but their disability prevents them from earning as much as 
normal workers do; sometimes the wage rates they could earn are so 
low that they couId not maintain themselves. These people can keep 
body and soul together only if other people help them. The next of 
kin, friends, the charity of benefactors and endowments, and com- 
munal poor relief take care of the destitute. Alms-folk do not co- 
operate in the social process of production; as far as the provision of 
the means for the satisfaction of wants is concerned, they do not act; 
they live because other people look after them. The problems of poor 
relief are problems of the arrangement of consumption, not of the 
arrangement of production activities. They are as such beyond the 
frame of a theory of human action which refers only to the provision 
of the means required for consumption, not to the way in which these 
means are consumed. Catallactic theory deals with the method5 
adopted for the charitable support of the destitute only as far as they 
can possibly affect the supply of labor. It has sometimes happened that 
the policies applied in poor relief have encouraged unwillingness to 
work and the idleness of able-bodied adults.

the rotracted war with France and the inflationary methods of financing it,

to prevent agricultural workers from leaving their jobs and going into the 
factories where they could earn more. The Speenhamland system was thus a 
disguised subsidy for the landed gentry saving them the expense of higher wages. 


Work and Wages 60 I 

In the capitalist society there prevails a tendency toward a steady 
increase in the per capita quota of capital invested. The accumula- 
tion of capital soars above the increase in popdation figures. Con- 
sequently the ~narginal productivity of labor, wage rates, and the wage 
earners' standard of living tend to rise continually. But this improve- 
nlent in well-being is not the manifestation of the operation of an in- 
evitable law of human evolution; it is a tendency resulting from the 
interplay of forces which can freely produce their effects only under 
capitalism. It is possible and, if we take into account the direction of 
present-day policies, even not unlikely that capital consumption on the 
one hand and an increase or an insufficient drop in population figures on 
the other hand will reverse things. Then it could happen that men will 
again learn literally what starvation means and that the relation of the 
quantity of capital goods available and population figures will become 
so unfavorablc as to make part of the workers earn less than a bare 
subsistence. The mere approach to such conditions would certainly 
cause irreconcilable dissensions within society, conflicts the violence 
of which must result in a complete disintegration of all societal bonds. 
The social division of labor cannot be preserved if part of the co- 
operating members of society are doomed to earn less than a bare 
subsistence. 

The notion of a physiological minimum of subsistence to which 
the "iron law of wages" refers and which demagogues put forward 
again and again is of no use for a catallactic theory of the determina- 
tion of wage rates. One of the foundations upon which social co- 
operation rests is the fact that labor performed according to the 
principle of the division of labor is so much more productive than 
the efforts of isolated individuals that able-bodied people are not 
troubled by the fear of starvation which daily threatened their fore- 
bears. Within a capitalist commonwealth the minimum of subsistence 
plays no catallactic role. 

Furthermore, the notion of a physiological minimum of subsistence 
lacks that precision and scientific rigor which people have ascribed to 
it. Primitive man, adjusted to a more animal-like than human existence, 
could keep himself alive under conditions which are literally unbear- 
able to his dainty scions pampered by capitalism. There is no such 
thing as a physiologically and biologically determined minimum of 
subsistence, valid for every specimen of the zoological species homo 
sapiens. ATo more tenable is the idea that a definite quantity of calories 
iq needed to keep a man healthy and progenitive, and a fukher definite 
quantity to replace the energy expended in working. The appeal to 
such notions of cattle breeding and the vivisection of guinea pigs does 


Human Action 

not aid the economist in his endeavors to comprehend the problems 
of purposive human action. The "iron law of wages" and the essen- 
tially identical Marxian doctrine of the determination of "the value 
of labor power" by "the working time necessary for its production, 
consequently also for its reproduction," are the least tenable of all 
that has ever been taught in the field of catallactics. 

Yet it was possible to attach some meaning to the ideas implied in 
the iron law of wages. If one sees in the wage earner merely a chattel 
and believes that he plays no other role in society, if one assumes that 
he aims at no other satisfaction then feeding and proliferation and 
does not know of any employment for his earnings other than the 
procurement of those animal satisfactions, one may consider the iron 
law as a theory of the determination of wage rates. In fact the classical 
economists, frustrated by their abortive value theory, could not think 
of any other solution of the problem involved. For Torrens and 
Ricardo the theorem that the natural price of labor is the price which 
enables the wage earners to subsist and to perpetuate their race, with- 
out any increase or diminution, was the logically inescapable inference 
from their untenable value theory. 13ut when fheir epigones saw that 
they could no longer satisfy themselves with this manifestly pre- 
posterous law, they rcsorted to a modification of it which was tanta- 
mount to a complete abandonment of any attempt to provide an 
economic explanation of the determination of wage rates. They tried 
to preserve the cherished notion of the minimum of subsistence by 
substituting the concept of a "social'' minimum for the concept of a 
physioIogica1 minimum. They no longer spoke of the minimum re- 
quired for the necessary subsistence of the laborer and for the preser- 
vation of an undiminished supply of labor. They spoke instead of the 
minimum required for the preservation of a standard of living 
sanctified by historical tradition and inhcrited customs and habits. 
While daily experience taught impressively that under capitalism real 
wage rates and the w-age earners' standard of living were steadily 
rising, while it bccame from day to day more obvious that the tradi- 
tional walIs separating the various strata of the population could no 
longer be preserved, because the social improvement in the conditions 
of the industrial workers demolished the vested ideas of social rank 
and dignity, these doctrinaires announced that old customs and social 
convention determine the height of wage rates. Only people blinded 

8. Cf. Marx, Das Kapital (7th ed. Hamburg, 1914)~I, 133. In the Communist 
Manifesto (Section 11) Marx and Engels formulate their doctrine in this way: 
"The average price of wage labor is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of 
means of subsistence which is absolutely required to keep the laborer in bare ex- 
istence as laborer." It "merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence." 

Work and Wages 

by preconceived prejudices and party bias could resort to such an 
explanation in an age in which industry supplies the consumption of 
the masses again and again with new commodities hitherto unknown 
and makes accessible to the average worker satisfactions of which no 
king could dream in the past. 

It is not especially remarkable that the Prussian Historical School 
of the wirtschaftliche Staatswissenschaften viewed w-age rates no less 
than commodity prices and interest rates as "historical categories" 
and that in dealing with wage ratcs it had recourse to the concept of 
"income adequate to the individual's hierarchical station in the social 
scale of ranks." It was the essence of the teachings of this school to 
deny the existence of economics and to substitute history for it. But 
it is amazing that Marx and the Marxians did not recognize that their 
endorsement of this spurious doctrine entirely disintegrated the body 
of the so-called Marxian system of economics. When the articles and 
dissertations published in England in the early 'sixties convinced Marx 
that it was no longer permissible to cling unswervingly to the wage 
thcory of the classical economists, he modified his theory of the value 
of labor power. He declared that "the extent of the so-called natural 
wants and the manner in which they are satisfied, are in themselves a 
product of historical evolution" and "depend to a large extent on the 
degree of civilization attained by any given country and, among other 
factors, especially on the conditions and customs and pretensions con- 
cerning the standard of life under which the class of free laborers 
has been formed." Thus "a historical and moral element enter into 
the determination of the value of labor power." But when Marx adds 
that nonetheless "for a given country at any given time, the average 
quantity of indisgensable necessaries of life is a given fact," " 
he contradicts himself and misleads the reader. What he has in mind 
is no longer the "indispensable necessaries," but the things considered 
indispensable from a traditional point of view, the means necessary for 
the preservation of a standard of living adequate to the workers' 
station in the traditional social hicrarchy. The recourse to such an ex- 
planation means virtually the renunciation of any cconomic or catal- 
lactic elucidation of the determination of wage rates. Wagc rates are 
explained as a datum of history. Thcy are no longer seen as a market 
phenomenon, but as a factor originating outside of the interplay of the 
forces operating on the market. 

However, even those who believe that the height of wage ratcs as 

9. Cf. Marx, Das Kapital, q; 134.Italics arc mine. The term used bv Marx which

Sanders Dictionary (16th ed.) translates this term "articles of food, provisions, 
victuals, grub!' 

Human Action 
they are actually paid and received in reality are forced upon the 
~narket from without as a datum cannot avoid developing a theory 
which explains the determination of wage rates as the outcome of 
the valuations and decisions of the consumers. Without such a catal- 
lactic theory of wages, no economic analysis of the market can be 
complcte and logically satisfactory. It is simply nonsensical to restrict 
the catallactic disquisitions to the problems of the determination of 
commodity prices and interest rates and to accept wage rates as a 
historical datum. An economic theory worthy of the name must be 
in a position to assert with regard to wage rates more than that they 
are determined by a "historical and moral element." The character- 
istic mark of economics is that it explains the exchange ratios mani- 
fested in market transactions as market phenomena the determination 
of which is subject to a regularity in the concatenation and sequence 
of events. It is precisely this that distinguishes economic conception 
from the historical understanding, theory from history. 
We can well imagine a historical situation in which the height of 
wage rates is forced upon the market by the interference of external 
compulsion and coercion. Such institutional fixing of wage rates is 
one of the most important features of our age of interventionist 
policies. But with regard to such a state of affairs it is the task of 
econon~icsto investigate what effects are brought about by the dis- 
parity between the two wage rates, the potential rate which the un-
hampered market would have produced by the interplay of the supply 
of and the demand for labor on the one hand, and on the other the rate 
which external compulsion and coercion impose upon the parties to 
the market transactions. 
It is true, wage earners are imbued with the idea that wages must 
be at least high enough to enable them to maintain a standard of living 
adequate to their station in the hierarchical gradation of society. 
Every single worker has his particular opinion about the claims he 
is entitled to raise on account of "status," "rank," "tradition," and 
"cuscom" in the same way as he has his particuiar opinion about his 
own efficiency and his own achievements. But such pretensions and 
self-complacent assumptions are without any relevance for the de- 
termination of wage rates. They limit neither the upward nor the 
downward movement of wage rates. The wage earner must sometimes 
satisfy himself with much less than what, according to his opinion, 
is adequate to his rank and efficiency. If he is offercd more than he 
expected, he pockets the surplus without a qualm. The age of laissez 
faire for which the iron law and Marx's doctrine of the historically 
determined formation of wage rates claim validity witnessed a pro- 


Work and Wages 

gressive, although sometimes temporarily interrupted, tendency for 
real wage rates to rise. The wage earners' standard of living rose to a 
height unprecedented in history and never thought of in earlier 
periods. 

The labor unions pretend that nominal wage rates at least must al- 
ways be raised in accordance with the changes occurring in the mone- 
tary unit's purchasing power in such a way as to secure to the wage 
earner the unabated enjoyment of the previous standard of living. 
They raise these claims also with regard to wartime conditions and 
the measures adopted for the financing of war expenditure. In their 

even in wartime neither inflation nor the withholding of 
incorne taxes must affect. the worker's take-home real wage rates. This 
doctrine tacitly implies the thesis of the Co~nmzcnist Manifesto that 
"the working men have no country" and have "nothing to lose but 
their chains"; consequently they are neutral in the wars waged by 
the bourgeois exploiters and do not care whether their nation conquers 
or is conquered. It is not the task of economics to scrutinize these 
statements. It only has to establish the fact that it does not matter 
what kind of justification is advanced in favor of the enforcement of 
wage rates higher than those the unhampered labor market would have 
determined. If as a result of such claims real wage rates are really 
raised above the height consonant with the marginal productivity 
of the various types of labor concerned, the unavoidable conse-
quences must appear without any regard to the underlying philoso- 

phy-

The same is valid with regard to the confused doctrine that wage 
earners arc entitled to claim for themselves all the benefits derived 
frotn inlprovements in what union officers cal the productivity of 
labor. On the unhampered labor market wage rates always tend toward 
the point at which they coincide with the marginal productivity of 
labor. The concept of the productivity of labor in general is no less 
empty than all other universal concepts of this kind, e.g., the concept 
of ihe vahe of iron or gold iii general. TOyakof &e productivity of 
labor in a sense other than that of the marginal productivity is mean- 
ingless. What these union officers have in mind is an ethical justification 
of their policies. However, the economic consequences of these 
policies are not affected by the pretexts advanced in their favor. 

Wage rates are ultimately determined by the value which the wage 

earner's fellow citizens attach to his services and achievements. Labor 

is appraised like a commodity not because the entrepreneurs and 

capitalists are hardhearted and callous, but because they are uncondi- 

tionally subject to the supremacy of the pitiless consumers. The con- 


Work and Wages 

are innate as well as acquired diversities in the abilities to perform 
certain types of work. The innate faculties required for certain types 
of work cannot be acquired by any training and schooling. 

4. The capacity to work must be dealt with appropriately if it 
is not to deteriorate or to vanish altogether. Special care is needed 
to preserve a man's abilities-both the innate and the acquired-for 
such a ~eriod as the unavoidable decline of his vital forces may permit. 
5. As work approaches the point at which the total amount of work 
a man can perform at the time is exhausted and the interpolation of a 
period of recreation is indispensable, fatigue impairs the quantity and 
the quality of the performance.lL 
6. Men prefer the absence of labor, i.e., leisure, to labor, or as the 
economists put it: they attach disutility to labor. 
The self-sufficient man who works in economic isolation for the 
direct satisfaction of his own needs only, stops working at the point 
at which he begins to vaIue leisure, the absence of labor's disutility, 
more highly than the increment in satisfaction expected from work- 
ing more. Having satisfied his most urgent needs, he considers the 
satisfaction of the still unsatisfied needs less desirable than the satisfac- 
tion of his striving after leisure. 

The same is true for wage earners no less than for an isolated autarkic 
worker. They too are not prepared to work untiI they have expended 
the total capacity of work they are capabIe of expending. They too 
are eager to stop working at the point at which the mediate gratifica- 
tion expected no longer outweighs the disutility involved in the per- 
formance of additional work. 

Popular opinion, laboring under atavistic representations and 
blinded by Marxian slogans, was slow in grasping this fact. It clung 
and even today clings to the habit of looking at the wage earner as 
a bondsman, and at wages as the capitalist equivalent of the bare 
subsistence w-hich the slave owner and the cattle owner must provide 
for their slaves and animals. In the eyes of this doctrine the wage 
earner is a man whom poverty has forced to submit to bondage. The 
vain formalism of the bourgeois lawyers, we are told, calls this subjec- 
tion voluntary, and interprets the relation between employer and em- 
ployee as a contract between two equal parties. In truth, however, 
the worker is not free; he acts under duress; he must submit to the yoke 
of virtual serfdom because as society's disinherited outcast no other 
choice is left to him. Even his apparent right to choose his master is 

I I. Other fluctuations in the quantity and quality of the performance per unit 
of time-e.g., the lower efficiency in the period immediately following the re- 
sumption of work interrupted by recreation-are hardly of any importance for 
the supply of labor on the market. 

Human Action 

spurious. The open or silent combination of the employers fixing the 
conditions of employment in a uniform way by and large makes this 
freedom illusory. 

If one assumes that wages are merely the reimbursement of the 
expenses incurred by the worker in the preservation and reproduction 
of labor power or that their height is determined by tradition, it 
is quite consistent to consider every reduction in the obligations which 
the labor contract imposes on the worker as a unilateral gain for the 
worker. If the height of wage rates does not depend on the quantity 
and quality of the performance, if the employer does not pay to thk 
worker the price the market assigns to his achievement, if the employer 
does not buy a definite quantity and quality of workmanship, but 
buys a bondsman, if wage rates are so low that for natural or "histori- 
cal" reasons they cannot drop any further, one improves the wage 
earner's lot by forcibly shortening the length of the working day. 
Then it is permissible to look at the laws limiting the hours of work 
as tantamount to the decrees by means of which European govern- 
ments of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth centuries 
step by step reduced and finally entirely abolished the amount of the 
unpaid statute labor (corv6e) which the peasant bondsmen were liable 
to give to their lords, or to ordinances lightening the work to be done 
by convicts. Then the shortening of daily hours of work which the 
evolution of capitah industrialism brought about is appraised as a 
victory of the exploited wage-slaves over the rugged selfishness of 
their tormentors. All laws imposing upon the employer the duty to 
make definite expenditures to the benefit of the employees are de- 
scribed as "social gains," i.c., as liberalities for the attainment of which 
the employees do not have to make any sacrjfice. 

It is generally assumed that the correctness of this doctrine is 
sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that the individual wage earner 
has only a negligible influence on the determination of the terms 
of the labor contract. The decisions concerning the length of the 
working day, work on Sundays and holidays, the time set for meals 
and many other things arc made by the employers without asking the 
employees. The wage earner has no other choice than to yield to 
these orders or to starve. 

The cardinal fallacy involved in this reasoning has already been 
pointed out in the preceding sections. The employers are not 
asking for labor in general, but for men who are fitted to perform the 
kind of labor they need. Just as an entrepreneur must choose for his 
plants the most suitable location, equipment, and raw materials, so 
he must hire the most efficient workers. He must arrange conditions of 


Work and Wages 

work in such a way as to make them appear attractive to those classes 
of workers he wants to employ. It is true that the individual worker 
has but little to say with regard to these arrangements. They are, 
like the height of wage rates itself, like commodity prices, and the 
shape of articles produced for mass consumption, the product of 
the interaction of innumerable people participating in the social 
process of the market. They are as such mass phenomena which are 
but little subject to modification on the part of a single individual. 
However, it is a distortion of truth to assert that the individuaI voter's 
ballot is without influence because many thousands or even millions 
of votes are required to decide the issue and that those of people not 
attached to any party virtually do not matter. Even if one wcre to 
admit this thesis for the sake of argument, it is a non sequitur to infer 
that the substitution of totalitarian principles for democratic pro- 
cedures would make the officeholders more genuine representatives of 
the people's will than election campaigns. The counterparts of these 
totalitarian fables in the field of the market's economic democracy 
are the assertions that the individual consumer is powerless against 
the suppliers and the individual employee against the employers. It 
is, of course, not an individual's taste, different from that of the 
many, that determincs the features of articles of mass production de- 
signed for mass consumption, but the wishes and likes of the majority. 
It is not the individual job-seeker, but the masses of job-seekers whose 
conduct determines the tcrms of the labor contracts prevailing in 
definitc areas or branches of industry. If it is customary to have lunch 
between noon and one o'cIock, an individual worker who prefers to 
have it between two and three P.M. has little chance of having his 
wishes satisfied. However, the social prcssure to which this solitary 
individual is subject in this case is not exercised by the employe;, 
but by his fellow employees. 

Employers in their search for suitable workers are forced to accorn- 
modate themselves even to serious and costly inconveniences if they 
cannot find those nceded on other terms. In many countries, some of 
them stigmatized as socially backward by the champions of anti-
capitalism, employers must yield to various wishes of workers moti- 
vated by considerations of religious ritual or caste and status. They 
must arrange hours of work, holidays, and many technical problems 
according to such opinions, however hurdensome such an adjustment 
may be. U7hcnever an empbyer asks for special pcrforrnances which 
appear irksome or repulsive to the en~ployees, he must pay extra for 
the excess of disutility the worker must expend. 

The terms of the labor contract refer to all working conditions, 


Hunzan Action 

not merely to the height of wage rates. Teamwork in factories and the 
interdependence of various enterprises make it impossible to deviate 
from the arrangcments custonlary in the country or in the branch 
concerned and thus result in a unification and standardizarion of these 
arrangements. But this fact neither weakens nor eliminates the em- 
ployees' contribution in their setting up. For the individual workers 
they are, of course, an unalterable datum as the railroad's timetable 
is for the individual traveler. But nobody would contend that in de- 
termining the timetable thc company does not bothcr about the wishes 
of the potential customers. Its intention is precisely to serve as many 
of them as possible. 

The interpretation of the evolution of modern industrialism has 
been utterly vitiated by the anticapitalistic bias of governments and 
the masses and the allegedly prolabor writers and historians. The rise 
in real wage rates, the shortening of hours of work, the elimination of 
child labor, and the restriction of the labor of married women, it is 
asserted, were the result of the interfercncc of governments and labor 
unions and the pressure of public opinion aroused by humanitarian 
authors. But for this interference and pressure the entrepreneurs and 
capitalists would have retained for themselves all the advantages 
derivcd from the increase in capital investment and the consequent 
improvement in technological methods. The rise in the wage earners' 
standard of living was thus brought about at the expense of the "un- 
earned'' income of capitalists, cntreprencurs, and landowners. It is 
highly desirable to continue these policies, benefiting the many at 
the sole expense of a few selfish exploiters, and to reduce more and 
more the unfair take of the propertied classes. 

The incorrectness of this interpretation is obvious. All measures 
restricting the supply of labor directly or indirectly burden the 
capitalists as far as they increase the marginal productivity of labor 
and reduce the marginal productivity of the material factors of pro- 
duction. As they restrict the supply of labor without reducing the 
supply of capi&l, they increase the portion allotted to the wage 
earners out of the total net produce of the production effort. But this 
total net produce will drop too, and it depends on the specific data 
of each case whether the relatively greater quota of a smaller cake 
will be greater or smaller than the relatively smaller quota of a bigger 
cake. The rate of interest and profits are not directly affected by 
the shortening of the total supply of labor. The prices of material 
factors of production drop and wage rates per unit of the individual 
worker's performance (not necessarily also per capita of the workers 
employed) rise. The prices of the products rise too. Whether all 


Work and Wages 61I 

these changes result in an improvement or in a deterioration of the 
average wage earner's income is, as has been said, a question of fact in 
each instance. 

But our assumption that such measures do not affect the supply 
of material factors of production is impermissible. The shortening 
of the hours of work, the restriction of night work and of the em- 
ployment of certain classes of people impair the utilization of a part 
of the equipment available and are tantamount to a drop in the supply 
of capital. The resulting intensification of the scarcity of capital goods 
may entirely undo the potential rise in the marginal productivity of 
labor as against the marginal productivity of capital goods. 

If concomitantly with the compulsory shortening of the hours of 
work the authorities or the unions forbid any corresponding reduc- 
tion in wage rates which the state of the market: would require or if 
previously prevailing institutions prevent such a reduction, the effects 
appear whch every attempt to keep wage rates at a height above the 
potential market rate brings about: institutional unemployment. 

The history of capitalism as it has operated in the last two t~undred 
years in the realm of Western civilization is the record of a steady 
rise in the wage earners' standard of living. The inhercnt mark of 
capitalism is that it is mass production for mass consumption directed 
by the most energetic and far-sighted individuals, unflaggingly aiming 
at improvement. Its driving force is the profit-motive the instrumen- 
tality of which forces the businessman constantly to provide the con- 
sumers with more, better, and cheaper amenities. An excess of profits 
over losses can appear only in a progressing economy and only to the 
extent to which the masses' standard of living irnprov~s?~ 

Thus capi-
talism is the system under which the keenest and most agile minds are 
driven to promote to the best of their abilities the welfare of the 
laggard many. 

In the field of historical experience it is impossible to resort to 
measurement. As money is no yardstick of value and want-satisfaction, 
it cannot be applied for comparing the standard of Iiving of people 
in various periods of time. Howcver, all historians whose judgment 
is not muddled by romantic prepossessions agree that the evolution 
of capitalism has inultiplied capital equipment on a scale which far 
exceeded the synchronous increase in population figures. Capital 
equipment both per capita of the total population and pcr capita of 
those abIc to work is immensely larger today than fifty, a hundred, 
or two hundred years ago. ConcomitantIy there has been a tremen- 
dous increase in the quota which the wage earners receive out of the

total amount of commodities produced, an amount which in itself 
is much bigger than in the past. The ensuing rise in the masses' 
standard of living is miraculous when compared with the conditions 
of ages gone by. In those merry old days even the wealthiest people 
led an existence which must be called straightened when compared 
with the average standard of the American or Australian worker of 
our age. Capitalism, says Marx, unthinkingly repeating the fables of 
the eulogists of the Middle Ages, has an inevitable tendency to irn- 
poverish the workers more and more. The truth is that capitalism has 
poured a horn of plenty upon the masses of wage earners who fre- 
quently did all they could to sabotage the adoption of those innova- 
tions which render their life more agreeable. How uneasy an American 
worker would be if hc were forced to live in the manor of a medieval 
lord and to miss the plumbing facilities and the other gadgets he simply 
takes for granted! 

The improvement in his material well-being has changed the work- 
er's valuation of leisure. Better supplied with the amenities of life 
as he is, he sooner reaches the point at which he looks upon any further 
increment in the disutility of labor as an evil which is no longer out- 
weighed by the expected further increment in labor's mediate gratiti- 
cation. He is eager to shorten the hours of daily work and to spare 
his wife and children the toil and trouble of gainful employment. 
It is not labor legislation and labor-union pressure that have shortened 
hours of work and withdrawn married women and children from 
the factories; it is capitalism, which has made the wage earner so 
prosperous that he is able to buy more leisure timc for himself arid 
his dependents. The nineteenth century's labor legislation by and 
large achieved nothing more than to provide a legal ratification for 
changes which the interplay of market factors had brought about 
previously. As far as it sometimes went ahead of industrial evolution, 
the quick advance in wealth soon made things right again. As far as 
the allegedly prolabor laws decreed measures which were not rnerely 
the ratification of changes already effected or the anticipation of 
changes to be expected in the immediate future, they hurt the material 
interests of the workers. 

The term "social gains" is utterly misleading. If the law forces 
workers who would prefer to work forty-eight hours a week not to 
give more than forty hours of work, or if it forces employers to 
incur certain expenses for the benefit of employees, it does not favor 
workers at the expense of employers. Whatever the provisions of 
a social security law may be, their incidence ultimately burdens the 
employee, not the employer. They affect the amount of take-home 


Work and Wages 

wages; if they raise the price the employer has to pay for a unit of 
performance above the potential market rate, they create institutional 
unemployment. Social security does not enjoin upon the employers 
the obligation to expend more in buying labor. It imposes upon the 
wage earners a restriction concerning the spending of their total in- 
come. It curtails the worker's freedom to arrange his household ac- 
cording to his own decisions. 

Whether such a system of social security is a good or a bad policy 
is essentially a poIitical problem. One may try to justify it by declaring 
that the wage earners lack the insight and the moral strength to 
provide spontaneously for their own future. But then it is not easy 
to silence the voices of those who ask whether it is not paradoxical 
to entrust the nation's welfare to the decisions of voters whom the 
law itself considers incapable of managing their own affairs; whether 
it is not absurd to make those people supreme in the conduct of 
government who are manifestly in need of a guardian to prevent them 
from spending their own income foolishly. Is it reasonable to assign 
to wards the right to elect their guardians? It is no accident that Ger- 
many, the country that inaugurated the social security system, was the 
cradle of both varicties of modern disparagement of democracy, the 
Marxian as well as the non-A4arxian. 

Rewzarks About the Popular Interpetation 
of the "Industrial Revolution" 

It is generally asserted that the history of modern industrialism and 
especially the history of the British "Industrial Revolution" provide an 
empirical verification of the "realistic" or "institutional" doctrine and 
utterly explode the "abstract" dogmatism of the economists.13 

The economists flatly deny that labor unions and government prolabor 
legislation can and did lastinel benefit the whole class of wage earners 

.a.y

and raise their standard of hvmg. But the facts, say the anti-economists, 
have refuted these fallacies. The statesman and legislators who enacted the 
factory acts displayed a better insight into reality than the economists. 
While laissez-faire philosophy, without pity and compassion, taught that 
the sufferings of the toiling masses are unavoidable, the commonsense of 

I 3. The attribution of the phrase "the Industrial Revolution" to the reigns of 
the two last Hanoverian Georges was the outcome of deliberate attempts to 
melodramatize econo~nic history in order to fit it into the Procrustean Marxian 
schemes. The transition from medieval methods of production to those of the free 
enterprise system was a long process that started centuries before 1760 and, even 
in England, was not finished in 1830.Yet, it is true that England's industrial 
development was considerably accelerated in the second half of the eighteenth 
century. It is therefore permissible to use the term "Industrial Revolution" in the 
examination of the emotional connotations with which Fabianism, Marxism, the 
Historical School, and Institutionalism have loaded it.

laymen succeeded in quelling the worst excesses of profit-seeking business. 
The improvement in the conditions of the workers is entirely an achieve- 
ment of governments and labor unions. 

Such are the ideas permeating most of the historical studies dealing with 
the evolution of modern industrialism. The authors begin by sketching an 
idyllic image of conditions as they prevailed on the eve of the "Industrial 
Revolution." At that time, they tell us, things were, by and large, satis- 
factory. The peasants were happy. So also were the industrial workers 
under the domestic system. They worked in their own cottages and en- 
joyed a certain economic independence since they owned a garden plot 
and their tools. But then "the Industrial Revolution fell like a war or a 
plague" on these people.14 The factory system reduced the free worker to 
virtual slavery; it lowered his standard of living to the level of bare sub- 
sistence; in cramming women and children into the mills it destroyed 
family life and sapped the very foundations of society, morality, and public 
health. A small minority of ruthless exploiters had cleverly succeeded in 
imposing their yoke upon the immense majority. 

The truth is that economic conditions were highly unsatisfactory on the 
eve of the Industrial Kevolution. The traditional social system was not 
elastic enough to provide for the needs of a rapidly increasing population. 
Neither farming nor the guilds had any use for the additional hands. Busi- 
ness was imbued with the inherited spirit of privilege and exclusive monop- 
oly; its institutional foundations were licenses and the grant of a patent of 
monopoly; its philosophy was restriction and the prohibition of competi- 
tion both domestic and foreign. The number of people for whom there 
was no room left in the rigid system of paternalism and government tute- 
lage of business grew rapidly. They werc virtually outcasts. The apathetic 
majority of these wretched people lived from the crumbs that fell from 
the tables of the established castes. In the harvest season they earned a trifle 
by occasional help on farms; for the rest they depended upon private 
charity and communal poor relief. Thousands of the most vigorous youths 
of these strata were pressed into the service of the Royal Army and Navy; 
many of them were killed or maimed in action; many more perished in- 
gloriously from the hardships of the barbarous discipline, from tropical 
diseases, or from syphilis.15 Other thousands, the boldest and most ruthless 
of their class, infested the country as vagabonds, beggars, tramps, robbers, 
and prostitutes. The authorities did not know of any means to cope with 
these individuals other than the poorhouse and the workhouse. The sup- 
port the government gave to the popular resentment against the introduc- 
tion of new inventions and labor-saving devices made things quite hopeless. 

The factory system developed in a continuous struggle against innumer-

able obstacles. It had to fight popular prejudice, old established customs, 
legally binding rules and regulations, the animosity of the authorities, the 
vested interests of privileged groups, the envy of the guilds. The capital 
equipment of the individual firms was insufficient, the provision of credit 
extremely difficult and costly. Technological and commercial experience 
was lacking. Most factory owners failed; comparatively few succeeded. 
Profits were sometimes considerable, but so were losses. It took many 
decades until the common practice of reinvesting the greater part of profits 
earned accumulated adequate capital for the conduct of affairs on a broader 
scale. 

That the factories couId thrive in spite of all these hindrances was due to 
two reasons. First there were the teachings of the new social philosophy 
expounded by the economists. They demolished the prestige of Mercantil- 
ism, paternalism, and restrictionism. They exploded the superstitious be- 
lief that labor-saving devices and processes cause unemployment and re- 
duce all people to poverty and decay. The laissez-faire economists were the 
pioneers of the unprecedented technological achievements of the last 
two hundred years. 

Then there was another factor that weakened the opposition to innova- 
tions. The factories freed the authorities and the ruling landed aristocracy 
from an embarrassing problem that had grown too large for them. They 
provided sustenance for the masses of paupers. They emptied the poor 
houses, the workhouses, and the prisons. They converted starving beggars 
into self-supporting breadwinners. 

The factory owners did not have the power to compel anybody to take 
a factory job. They could only hire people who were ready to work for 
the wages offered to them. Low as these wage rates were, they were none- 
theless much more than these paupers could earn in any other field open to 
them. It is a distortion of facts to say that the factories carried off the 
housewives from the nurseries and the kitchens and the children from their 
play. These women had nothing to cook with and to feed their children. 
These children were destitute and starving. Their only refuge was the 
factory. It saved them, in the strict sense of the term, from death by starva- 
tion. 

It is deplorable that such conditions existed. But if one wants to blame 
those responsible, one must not blame the factory owners who-driven by 
selfishness, of course, and not by "altruismn-did all they could to eradi- 
cate the evils. What had caused these evils was the economic order of the 
precapitalistic era, the order of the "good old days." 

In the first decades of the Industrial Revolution the standard of living 
of the factory workers was shockingly bad when compared with the con- 
temporary conditions of the upper classes and with the present conditions 
of the industrial masses. Hours of work were long, the sanitary conditions 
in the workshops deplorable. The individual's capacity to work was used 
up rapidly. But the fact remains that for the surplus population which the 
enclosure movement had reduced to dire wretchedness and for which 


616 Human Action 

there was literally no room left in the frame of the prevailing system of 
production, work in the factories was salvation. These people thronged 
into the plants for no reason other than the urge to improve their standard 
of living. 

The laissez-faire ideology and its offshoot, the "Industrial Revolution," 
blasted the ideological and institutional barriers to progress and welfare. 
They demolished the social order in which a constantly increasing number 
of peopIe were doomed to abject need and destitution. The processing 
trades of earlier ages had almost cxclusively catered to the wants of the 
well-to-do. Their expansion was limited by the amount of luxuries the 
wealthier strata of the population could afford. Those not engaged in the 
production of primary commodities could earn a living only as far as thc 
upper classes were disposed to utilize their skill and services. But now a 
different principle came into operation. The factory system inaugurated a 
new mode of marketing as well as of production. Its characteristic feature 
was that the manufactures were not designed for the consumption of a few 
well-to-do only, but for the consumption of those who had hitherto played 
but a negligible role as consumers. Cheap things for the many, was the 
objective of the factory system. Thc classical factory of the early days of 
the Industrial Revolution was the cotton mill. Now, the cotton goods it 
turned out were not something the rich were asking for. These wealthy 
people clung to silk, linen, and cambric. U'henevcr the factory with its 
methods of mass production by means of power-drivcn machines invaded 
a new branch of production, it started with the production of cheap goods 
for the broad masses. The factories turned to the production of more re- 
fined and therefore more expensive goods only at a later stage, when the 
unprecedented improvement in the masses' standard of living which they 
caused made it profitable to apply the methods of mass production also 
to these better articles. Thus, for instance, the factory-made shoe was for 
many years bought only by the "proletarians" while the wealthier con- 
sumers continued to patronize the custom shoemakers. The much talked, 
about sweatshops did not produce clothes for the rich, but for people in 
modest circumstances. The fashionable ladies and gentlemen preferred and 
still do prefer custom-made frocks and suits. 

The outstanding fact about the Industrial Revolution is that it opened 
an age of mass product~on for the needs of the masses. The wage earners 
are no longer people toiling rncrcly for other people's well-being. They 
themselves are the main consumers of thc products the factories turn out. 
Big business dcpcnds upon mass consumption. There is, in present-day 
America, not a single branch of big business that would not cater to the 
needs of the masses. The very principle of capitalist entrepreneurship is to 
provide for the common man. In his capacity as consumer the common 
man is the sovereign whose buying or abstention from buying decides the 
fate of entrepreneurial activitics. There is in the market economy no other 
means of acquiring and preserving wealth than by supplying the masses 
in the best and cheapest way with all the goods they ask for. 


Work nnd Wages 

Blinded by their prejudices, many historians and writers have entirely 
failed to recognize this fundamental fact. As they see it, wage earners toil 
for the benefit of other people. They never raise the question who these 
"other" people are. 

Mr. and Mrs. Hammond tell us that the workers were happier in 1760 
than they were in 1830.'~ This is an arbitrary value judgment. There is no 
means of comparing and measuring the happiness of different people and 
of the same people at different times. We may agree for the sake of argu- 
ment that an individual who was born in I 740 was happier in 1760 than in 
I 830. But let us not forget that in I 770 (according to the estimate of Arthur 
Young) England had 8.5 million inhabitants, while in 1831 (according to 
the census) the figure was 16 million.l7 This conspicuous increase was 
mainly conditioned by the Industrial Revolution. With regard to these 
additional Englishmen the assertion of the eminent historians can only be 
approved by those who endorse the melancholy verses of Sophocles: "Not 
to be born is, beyond all question, the best; but when a man has once seen 
the light of day, this is next best, that speedily he should return to that 
place whence he came." 

The early industrialists were for the most part men who had their 
origin in the same social strata from which their workers came. They lived 
very modestly, spent only a fraction of their earnings for their households 
and put the rest back into the business. But as the entrepreneurs grew 
richer, the sons of successful businessmen began to intrude into the circles 
of the ruling class. The highborn gentlemen envied the wealth of the 
parvenus and resented their sympathies with the reform movement. They 
hit back by investigating the material and moral conditions of the factory 
hands and enacting factory legislation. 

The history of capitalism in Great Britain as well as in all other capitalist 
countries is a record of an unceasing tendency toward the improvement 
in the wage earners' standard of living. This evolution coincided with the 
developn~ent of prolabor legislation and the spread of labor unionism on 
the one hand and with the increase in the marginal productivity of labor 
on the other hand. The economists assert that the improvement in the 
workers' material conditions is due to the increase in the per capita quota 
of capital invested and the technological achievements which the employ- 
ment of this additional capital brought about. As far as labor legislation and 
union pressure did not exceed the limits of what the workers would have 
got without them as a necessary consequence of the acceleration of capital 
accumulation as compared with population, they were superfluous. As far 
as they exceeded these limits, they were harmful to the interests of the 
masses. They delayed the accumulation of capital thus slowing down the 
tendency toward a rise in the marginal productivity of labor and in wage 
rates. They conferred privileges on some groups of wage earners at the

618 Hzman Action 

expense of other groups. They created mass uncmployment and decreased 
the amount of products available for the workers in their capacity as con- 
sumers. 

The apologists of government intcrfcrcnce with business and of labor 
unionism ascribe all the improvements in the conditions of the workers 
to the actions of governments and unions. Except for them, they contend, 
the workers' standard of living would be no higher today than it was in the 
early years of thc factory system. 

It is obvious that this controversy cannot be settlcd by appeal to histori- 
cal experience. With regard to the establishment of the facts thcre is no dis- 
agreement between the two groups. Their antagonism concerns the inter- 
pretation of events, and this interpretation must be guided by the theory 
chosen. The epistemological and logical considerations which detcrrnine 
the correctncss or incorrectness of a theory are logicallp and temporally 
antecedent to the elucidation of the historical problenl involved. The his- 
torical facts 3s such neither prove nor disprove any theory. They need to 
be interpreted in the light of theoretical insight. 

Most of the authors who u-rote the history of thc conditions of labor 
under capitalism were ignorant of economics and boasted of this ignorance. 
However, this contempt for sound economic reasoning did not mean that 
they approached the topic of their studies without prepossession and 
without bias in favor of any thcory. They were guided by the popular 
fallacies concerning governn~ental omnipotence and the alleged blessings 
of labor unionism. It is beyond question that the Webbs as well as Lujo 
Brentano arid a host of minor authors were at the very start of their 
studies imbued with a fanatical dislike of the market economy and an 
enthusiastic endorsement of the doctrines of socialism and interventionism. 
They were certainly honest and sincere in their convictions and tried to 
do their best. Their candor and probity exonerates them as individuals; it 
does not exonerate them as historians. However pure the intentions of a 
historian may be, there is no excuse for his recourse to fallacious doctrines. 
The first duty of a historian is to examine with the utmost care all the 
doctrines to which he resorts in dealing with the subject matter of his 
work. If he neglects to do this and na'ively espouses the garbled and con- 
fused ideas of popular opinion, he is not a historian but an apologist and 
propagandist. 

The antagonism between the two opposite points of view is not merely a 
historical problem. It refers no less to the most burning problems of the 
present day. It is the matter of controversy in what is called in present-day 
America the problem of industrial relations. 

Let us stress one aspect of the matter only. Vast areas-Eastern Asia, the 
East Indics, Southern and Southeastern Europc, Latin America-arc only 
superficially affectcd by modern capitalism. Conditions in these countries 
by and large do not differ from those of England on the eve of the "ln- 
dustrial Revolution." There are rnillions and millions of people for whom 
there is no secure place left in the traditional economic setting. The fate 


Work and Wages 

of these wretched masses can be improved only by industrialization. What 
they need most is entrepreneurs and capitalists. As their own foolish 
policies have deprived these nations of the further enjoyment of the as- 
sistance imported forcign capital hitherto gave them, they must embark 
upon domestic capital accumulation. They must go through all the stages 
through which the evolution of Westcrn industrialism had to pass. They 
must start with comparatively low wage rates and long hours of work. 
But, deluded by the doctrines prevailing in present-day Western Europe 
and North America, their statesmen think that they can proceed in a 
different way. They encourage labor-union pressure and alleged prolabor 
legislation. Their interventionist radicalism nips in the bud all attempts to 
create domestic industries. These men do not comprehend that industriali- 
zation cannot begin with the adoption of the precepts of the International 
Labor Ofice and the principles of the American Congress of Industrial 
Organizations. Their stubborn dogmatism spells the doom of the Indian 
and Chinese coolies, the Mexican peons, and millions of other peoples, 
desperately struggling on the verge of starvation. 

8. ?Vage Rates as Affected by the Vicissitudes 
of the Market 
Labor is a factor of production. The price which the scllcr of labor 
can obtain on the market dcpends on the data of the markct. 

The quantity and the quaIity of labor which an individual is fittcd 
to deliver is determined by his innate and acquired characteristics. 
The innate abilities cannot be altcred by any purposeful conduct. 
They are the individual's heritage with which his anccstors have 
endowed him on the day of his birth. He can bestow care upon these 
gifts and cultivate his taicnts, he can keep thcm from prematurely 
withering away; but he can never cross the boundaries which nature 
has drawn to his forces and abilities. He can display more or less skill 
in his endeavors to sell his capacity to work at the highest price which 
is obtainable on the market under prevailing conditions; but he cannor 
change his nature in order to adjust it better to the state of the marltet 
data. It is good luck for him if marltet conditions are such that a kind 
of labor which hc is able to perform is lavishly remuncrated; it is 
chance, not personal merit if his innate talents are highly appreciated 
by his fellow men. Miss Greta Garbo, if she had lived a hundred years 
earlier, would probably have earned rnuch Jess than she did in this age 
of moving. picturcs. As far as her innate taIents are concerned, she is 
in a position similar to that of a farmer whose farm can be sold ar 
a high price because the expansion of a ncighboring city converted it 
into urban soiI. 


Human Action 

Within the rigid limits drawn by his innate abilities, a man's capacity 
to work can be perfected by training for the accomplishment of 
definite tasks. The individual-or his parents-incurs expenses for 
a training the fruit of which consists in the acquisition of the ability 
to perform certain kinds of work. Such schooling and training in- 
tensify a man's one-sidedness; they make him a specialist. Every special 
training enhances the specific character of a man's capacity to uvork. 
'The toil and trouble, the disutility of the efforts to which an individual 
must submit in order to acquire these special abilities, the loss of po-
tential earnings during the training period, and the money expenditure 
required arc laid out in the expectation that the later increment in 
earnings will compensate for them. Thcse expenses are an investment 
and as such speculative. It depends on the future state of the market 
whether or not they- mill pay. In training himself the worker becomes 
a speculator and cntrcpreneur. The future state of the market will 
determine whether profit or loss results from his investment. 

Thus the wage earner has vested interests in a twofold sense as a 
man with definite innate qualities and as a man who has acquired 
definite special skills. 

The wage earner sells his labor on the market at the price which the 
market allows for it today. In the imaginary construction of the evenly 
rotating economy the sum of the prices which the entrepreneur must 
expend for all the complementary factors of production together 
must equal-due consideration being made for time preference-the 
price of the product. In the changing economy changes in the market 
structure may bring about differences between these two magnitudes. 
'The ensuing profits and losses do not affect the wage earner. Their 
incidence falls upon the employer alone. The uncertainty of the futurc 
affects the employee only as far as the following items are concerned: 

1. 
The expenses incurred in time, disutility, and money for train- 
ing. 
2. 
'The expenses incurred in moving to a definite place of work. 
;. 
in case of a labor conrracr: scipuiared for a definite period of 
time, changes in the price of the specific type of labor occurring 
in the meantime and changes in the employer's solvency. 

9. The Labor Market 
Wages are the prices paid for the factor of production, human 
labor. As is the case with all the other prices of complementary factors 
of production thcir height is ultimately determined by the prices of 
the products as they are expected at the instant the labor is sold and 


Work and Wages 

bought. It does not matter whether he who performs the labor sells 
his services to an employer who combines them with the material 
factors of production and with the services of other people or whether 
he himself embarks upon his own account and peril upon these acts 
of combination. The final price of labor of the same quality is at any 
rate the same in the whole market system. Wage rates are always 
equal to the price of the full produce of labor. 'l'hc popular slogan 
"the worker's right to the full produce of labor" was an absurd formu- 
lation of the claim that the consumers' goods should be distributed 
exclusively among the workers and nothing should be left to the 
entrepreneurs and the owners of the material factors of production. 
From no point of view whatever can artifacts be considered as the 
products of mere labor. They are the yield of a purposive combination 
of labor and of material factors of production. 

In the changing economy there prevails a tendency for market 
wage rates to adjust themselves precisely to the state of the final wage 
rates. This adjustment is a tirne-absorbing process. The length of 
the period of adjustment dcpends on the time required for the training 
for new jobs and for the removal of workers to new places of resi- 
dence. It depends furthermore on subjective factors, as for instance 
the workers' familiarity with the conditions and prospects of the 
labor market. The adjustment is a speculative venture as far as the 
training for new jobs and the change of residence involve costs which 
are expended only- if one believes that the future state of the labor 
market will make them appear profitable. 

With regard to all these things there is nothing that is peculiar to 
labor, wages, and the labor market. What gives a particular feature 
to the labor market is that the worker is not merely the purveyor 
of the factor of production labor, but also a human being and that it 
is impossible to sever the man from his performance. Reference to 
this fact has been mostly used for extravagant utterances and for a 
vain critique of the economic teachings concerning wage rates. HOW-
ever, these absurdities must not prevent economics from paying ade- 
quate attention to this primordial fact. 

For the worker it is a matter of consequence what kind of labor 
he performs among the various kinds he is able to perform, where he 
performs it, and under what particular conditions and circumstances. 
An unaffected observer mav consider empty or even ridiculous 
prejudices the ideas and feeiings that actuate a worker to prefer 
certain jobs, certain places of work, and certain conditions of labor 
to others. However, such academic judgments of unaffected censors 
are of no avail. For an economic treatment of the problems involved 


Huvzan Action 

there is nothing especially remarkable in the fact that the worlter looks 
upon his toil and trouble not only from the point of view of the dis- 
utility of labor and its mediate gratification, but also takes into account 
whether the special conditions and circumstances of its performance 
interfere with his enjoyment of life and to what extent. The fact that 
a worker is ready to forego the chance to increase his money earnings 
by migrating to a place he considers less desirable and prefers to re- 
main in his native place or country is not more remarkable than the 
fact that a wealthy gentleman of no occupation prefers the more ex- 
~ensivc life in the capital to the cheaper life in a small town. The 
worker and the consumer are the same person; it is merely economic 
reasoning that integrates the social functions and splits up this unity 
into two schemes. Men cannot sever their decisions concerning the 
utilization of their working power from those concerning the enjoy- 
ment of their earnings. 

Descent, language, education, religion, mentality, family bonds, and 
social environment tie the worker in such a way that he does not choose 
the place and the branch of his work merely with regard to the height 
of wage rates. 

We may call that height of wage rates for definite types of labor 
which would prevail on the market if the workers did not discriminate 
between various places and, wage rates being equal, did not prefer 
one working place to another, standard wage rates (S).If, however, 
the wage earners, out of the above-mentioned considerations, value 
differently work in different places, the height of market wage rates 

(M) can permanently deviate from the standard rates. We may call 
the maximum difference between the market rate and the sta&ard 
rate which does not yet result in the migration of workers from the 
places of lower market wage rates to those of higher market wage 
rates the attachment component (A).The attachment component of 
a definite geographical place or area is either positive or negative. 
We must furthermore take into account that the various places 
and areas differ with regard to provision with consumer? goods as 
far as transportation costs (in the broadest sense of the term) are con- 
cerned. These costs are lower in some areas, higher in other areas. 
Then there are differences with regard to the physical input required 
for the attainment of the same amount of physical satisfaction. In 
some places a man must expend more in order to attain the same degree 
of want-satisfaction which, apart from the circumstances determining 
the amount of the attachment component, he could attain elsewhere 
more cheaply. On the other hand, a man can in some places avoid 
certain expenses without any impairment of his want-satisfaction 


Work and Wages 

while renunciation of these expenses would curtail his satisfaction in 
other places. We may call the expenses which a worker must incur 
in certain places in order to attain in this sense the same degree of 
want-satisfaction, or which he can spare without curtailing his want- 
satisfaction, the cost component (C). The cost component of a 
definite geographical place or area is either positive or negative. 

If we assume that there are no institutional barriers preventing or 
penalizing the transfer of capital goods, workers, and commodities 
from one place or area to another and that the workers are indifferent 
with regard to their dwelling and working places, there prevails a 
tendency toward a distribution of population over the earth's surface 
in accordance with the physical productivity of the primary natural 
factors of production and the immobilization of inconvertible factors 
of production as effecred in the past. There is, if we disregard the 
cost component, a tendency toward an equalization of wage rates for 
the same type of work all over the earth. 

It would be permissible to call an area comparatively overpopulated 
if in it market wage rates plus the (positive or negative) cost com- 
ponent are lower than the standard ratcs, and comparatively under- 
populated if in it market wage rates plus the (positive or negative) cost 
component are higher than the standard rates. But it is not expedient to 
resort to such a definition of the terms involved. It does not help us 
in explaining the real conditions of the formation of wage rates 
and the conduct of wage earners. It is more expedient to choose an- 
other definition. We may call an area comparatively overpopulated 
if in it market wage rates are lower than the standard rates plus both 
the (positive or negative) attachment component and the (positive or 
negative) cost component. thar: is where M < (S +A $ C). Ac- 
cordingly an area is to be called comparatively underpopulated in 
which M > (S $ A +C). In the absence of institutional migration 
barriers workers move from the comparatively overpopulated areas 
to the comparatively underpopulated until everywhere M =S + 

A +C. 

The same is true, mutatis mutandis, for the migration of individuals 

working on their own account and selling their labor in disposing of 

its products or in rendering personal services. 

The concepts of the attachment component and the cost component 

apply in the same way to shifting from one branch of business or oc- 

cupation to another. 

It is hardly necessary to observe that the migrations which these 

theorems describe come to pass only in so far as there are no institu- 

tional barriers to the mobility of capital, labor, and commodities. In 


Human Action 

this age aiming at the disintegration of the international division of 
labor and at each sovereign nation's economic self-sufficiency, the 
tendencies they describe are operative only within each nation's 
boundaries. 

The Work of Animals and of Slaves 

For man, animals are a material factor of production. It may be that one 
day a change in moral sentiments will induce people to treat animals more 
gently. Yet, as far as men do not leave the animals alone and let them go 
their way, they will always deal with them as mere objects of their own 
acting. Social cooperation can exist only between human beings because 
only these are able to attain insight into the meaning and the advantages of 
the division of labor and of peaceful cooperation. 

Man subdues the animal and integrates it into his scheme of action as a 
material thing. In taming, domesticating, and training animals man often 
displays appreciation for the creature's psychologicaI peculiarities; he ap- 
peals, as it were, to its soul. But even then the gulf that separates man from 
animal remains unbridgeable. An animal can never get anything else than 
satisfaction of its appetites for food and sex and adequate protection against 
injury resulting from environmental factors. Animals are bestial and in- 
human precisely because they are such as the iron law of wages imagined 
workers to be. As human civiiization wouId never have emerged if men 
were exclusively dedicated to feeding and mating, so animals can neither 
consort in social bonds nor participate in human society. 

People have tried to look upon fellow men as they look upon animals and 
to deal with them accordingly. They have used whips to compel galley 
slaves and barge haulers to work like capstan-horses. However, experience 
has shown that these methods of unbridled brutalization render very un-
satisfactory results. Even the crudest and dullest people achieve more when 
working of their own accord than under the fear of the whip. 

Primitive man makes no distinction between his property in women, 
children, and slaves on the one hand and his property in cattle and inani- 
mate things on the other. But as soon as he begins to expect from his slaves 
services other than such as can also be rendered by draft and pack animals, 
he is forced to loosen their chains. He must try to substitute the incentive 
of self-interest for the incentive of mere fear; he must try to bind the slave 
to himself by human feelings. If the slave is no longer prevented from flee- 
ing exclusively by being chained and watched and no longer forced to 
work exclusively under the threat of being whipped, the relation between 
master and slave is transformed into a social nexus. The slave may, espe- 
cially if the memory of happier days of freedom is still fresh, bemoan his 
misfortune and hanker after liberation. But he puts up with what seems to 
be an inevitable state of affairs and accommodates himself to his fate in 
such a way as to make it as bearable as possible. The slave becomes intent 
upon satisfying his master through application and carrying out the tasks 


Work and Wages 

entrusted to him; the master becomes intent upon rousing the slave's zeal 
and loyalty through reasonable treatment. There develop between lord 
and drudge familiar relations which can properly be called friendship. 

Perhaps the eulogists of slavery were not entirely wrong when they 
asserted that many slaves were satisfied with their station and did not aim 
at changing it. There are perhaps individuals, groups of individuals, and 
even whole peoples and races who enjoy the safety and security provided 
by bondage; who, insensible of humiliation and mortification, are glad to 
pay with 3 moderate amount of labor for the privilege of sharing in the 
amenities of a well-to-do household; and in whose eyes subjection to the 
whims and bad tempers of a master is only a minor evil or no evil at all. 

Of course, the conditions under which the servile workers toiled in big 
farms and plantations, in mines, in workshops, and galleys were very dif- 
ferent from the idyllically described gay life of domestic valets, chamber- 
maids. cooks. and nurses and from the conditions of unfree laborers, dairy- 

, 

maids, herdsmen, and shepherds of small farming. hro apologist of slavery 
was bold enough to glorify the lot of the Roman agricultural slaves, chained 
and crammed together in the ergastulum, or of the Negroes of the Ameri- 
can cotton and sugar plantations.'* 

The abolition of slaverv and serfdom is to be attributed neither to the 
teachings of theologians and moralists nor to weakness or generosity on the 
part of the masters. There were among the teachers of religion and ethics 
as many eloquent defenders of bondage as opponents.lg Servile labor dis- 
appeared because it could not stand the competition of free labor; its un- 
profitability sealed its doom in the market economy. 

The price paid for the purchase of a slave is determined by the net 
yield expected from his employment (both as a worker and as a progenitor 
of other slaves) just as the price paid for a cow is determined by the net 
yield expected from its utilization. The owner of a slave does not pocket a 
specific revenue. For him there is no "exploitation" boon derived from 
the fact that the slave's work is not remunerated and that the potential 
market price of the services he renders is possibly greater than the cost of 
feeding, sheltering, and guarding him. He who buys a slave must in the 
price paid make good for these economies as far as they may be expectcd; 
he pays for them in full, due allowance being made for time preference. 

---.

whether the proprietor employs the slave in his own household or enter- 
prise or rents his services to other people, he does not enjoy any specific 
advantage from the existence of the institution of slavery. The specific 
boon goes totally to the slave-hunter, i.e., the man who deprives free men 

18. Margaret Mitchell, who in her popular novel Gone Withthe Wind (New 
York, 1936) eulogizes the South's slavery system, is cautious enough not to enter 
into particulars concerning the plantation hands, and prefers to dwell upon the 
conditions of domestic servants, who even in her account appear as an aristocracy 
of their caste.

of their liberty and transforms them into slaves. But, of course, the profita- 
bility of the slave-hunter's business depends upon the height of the prices 
buyers are ready to pay for the acquisition of slaves. If these prices drop 
below the operation and transportation costs incurred in the business of 
slavc-hunting, business no longer pays and must be discontinued. 

Now, at no time and at no place was it possible for enterprises employ- 
ing servile labor to compete on the market with enterprises employing free 
labor. Servile labor could always be utilized only where it did not have to 
meet the competition of free labor. 

If one treats men like cattle, one cannot squeeze out of them more than 
cattle-like performances. But it then becomes significant that man is physi- 
cally weaker than oxen and horses and that feeding and guarding a slave 
is, in proportion to the performance to be reaped, more expensive than 
feeding and guarding cattle. When treated as a chattel, man renders a 
smaller yield per unit of cost expended for current sustenance and guard- 
ing than domestic animals. If one asks from an unfree laborer human pcr- 
formances, one must provide him with specifically human inducements. If 
the employer aims at obtaining products which in quality and quantity 
excel those whose production can be extorted by the whip, he must interest 
the toiler in the yield of his contribution. Instead of punishing laziness and 
sloth, he must reward diligence, skill, and eagerness. But whatever he may 
try in this respect, he will never obtain from a bonded worker, i.e., a 
worker who does not reap the full market price of his contribution, a per- 
formance equal to that rendered by a freeman, i.e., a man hired on the 
unhampered labor market. The upper limit beyond which it is impossible 
to lift the quality and quantity of the products and services rendered by 
slave and serf labor is far below the standards of free labor. In the pro- 
duction of articles of superior quality an enterprise employing the ap- 
parently cheap labor of unfree workers can never stand the competition of 
enterprises crnploying free labor. It is this fact that has made all systems of 
compulsory labor disappear. 

Social institutions once made whole areas or branches of production 
reservations exclusively kept for the occupation of unfree labor and 
sheltered against any competition on the part of entrepreneurs employing 
free men. Slavery and serfdom thus became essential features of a rigid 
caste system that could be neither removed nor modified by the actions of 
individuals. Wherever conditions were different, the slave owners them- 
selves resorted to measures which were bound to abolish, step by step, the 
whole system of unfree labor. It was not humanitarian feelings and 
clemency that induced the callous and pitiless slaveholders of ancient 
Rome to loosen the fetters of their slaves, but the urge to derive the best 
possible gain from their property. They abandoncd the system of central- 
ized big-scale management of thcir vast landholdings, the latifundia, and 
transformed the slaves into virtual tenants cultivating thcir tenements on 
their own account and owing to the landlord merely either a lease or a 
share of the yield. In the processing trades and in commerce the slaves be- 


Work and Wages 

came entrepreneurs and their funds, the peculium, their legal quasi- 
property. Slaves were manumitted in large numbers because the freedman 
rendered to the former owner, the patronus, services more valuable than 
those to be expected from a slave. For the manumission was not an act of 
grace and a gratuitous gift on the part of the owner. It was a credit opera- 
tlon, a purchase of freedom on the installment plan, as it were. The frced- 
man was bound to render the former owner for many years or even for a 
lifetime definite payments and services. The patronus moreover had 
special rights of inheritance to the estate of the deceased freedrnan.?O 

With the disappearance of the plants and farms employing unfree 
laborers, bondage ceased to be a system of production and became a 
political privilege of an aristocratic caste. The overlords were entitled to 
definite tributes in kind or money and to definite services on the part of 
their subordinates; moreover their serf's children were obliged to serve 
them as servants or military retinue for a dcfinite length of time. But the 
underprivileged peasants and artisans operated their farms and shops 
on their own account and peril. Only when thcir processes of produc- 
tion were accomplished did the lord step in and claim a part of the pro- 
ceeds. 

Later, from the sixteenth century on, people again began to employ un- 
free workers in agricultural and even sometimes in industrial big-scale pro- 
duction. In the American colonies Kegro slabery becarne the standard 
method of the plantations. In Eastern Europe-in Northeastern Germany, 
in Bohemia and its annexes Moravia and Silesia, in Poland, in the Baltic 
countries, in Russia, and also in Hungary and its anncxcs-big-scale farm-
ing was built upon the unlimited statute labor of serfs. Both these systems 
of unfree labor were sheltered by poIitical institutions against the competi- 
tion of enterprises employing free workers. In the plantation colonies the 
high costs of immigration and the lack of sufficient legal and judicial pro- 
tection of the individual against the arbitrariness of government officers 
and the planter aristocracy prevented the emergence of a sufficient supply 
of free labor and the development of a class of indepcndent farmers. In 
Eastern Europe the caste system made it impossible for outsiders to enter 
the field of agricultural production. Big-scale farming was reserved to 
menlbers of the nobility. Small holdings were reserved to unfree bondmen. 
Yet the fact that the enterprises einpioying unfree iabor wouid not be 
able to stand the competition of enterprises employing free labor was not 
contested by anybody. On this point the eighteenth- and early nineteenth- 
century authors on agricultural management were no less unaninlous than 
the writers of ancient Rome on farm problems. But the abolition of slavery 
and serfdom could not be affected by the free play of the market system, as 
political institutions had withdrawn the estates of the nobility and the 
plantations from the supremacy of the market. Slavery and serfdom were

The Slave Power (London, 1862), p. 234. 

Human Action 

abolished by political action dictated by the spirit of the much-abused 
laissez faire, laissez passer ideology. 

Today mankind is again faced with endeavors to substitute compulsory 
labor for the labor of the freeman selling his capacity to work as a "com- 
modity'' on the market. Of course, people believe that there is an essential 
difference between the tasks incumbent upon the comrades of the socialist 
conlnlonwealth and those incumbent upon slaves or serfs. The slaves and 
serfs, they say, toiled for the benefit of an exploiting lord. But in a socialist 
system thc produce of labor goes to society of which the toiler himself is a 
part; here the worker works for himself, as it were. What this reasoning 
overlooks is that the identification of the individual comrades and the 
totality of all comrades with the collective entity pocketing the produce of 
all work is merely fictitious. Whether the ends which the community's 
officeholders are aiming at agree or disagree with the wishes and desires 
of the various comrades, is of minor importance. The main thing is that 
the individual's contribution to the coIlective entity's wealth is not requited 
in the shape of wages determined by the market. ,4 socialist commonwealth 
lacks any method of economic calculation; it cannot determine separately 
what quotas of the total amount of goods produced are to be assigned to 
the various complementary factors of production. As it cannot ascertain 
the magnitude of the contrib~tion society owes to the various individual's 
efforts, it cannot remunerate the workers according to the value of their 
performance. 

In order to distinguish free labor from compulsory labor no metaphysi- 
cal subtleties concerning the essence of freedom and compulsion are re- 
quired. We may call free labor that kind of extroversive, not immediately 
gratifying labor that a man performs either for the direct satisfaction of his 
own wants or for their indirect satisfaction to be reaped by expending the 
price earned by its sale on the market. Compulsory labor is labor per- 
formed under the pressure of other incentives. If somebody were to take 
umbrage at this terminology because the employment of words like free- 
dom and compulsion may arouse an association of ideas injurious to a dis- 
passionate treatment of the problems involved, one could as well choose 
other terms. We may substitute the expression F labor for the term free 
labor and the term C labor for the term compulsory labor. The crucial 
problem cannot be affected by the choice of the terms. -w-hat aione matters 
is this: What kind of inducement can spur a man to submit to the disutility 
of labor if his own want-satisfaction neither directly nor-to any appreci- 
able extent-indirectly depends on the quantity and quality of his perform-
ance? 

Let us assume for the sake of argument that many workers, perhaps 
even most of them, will of their own accord dutifully take pains for the 
best possible fulfillment of the tasks assigned to them by their superiors. 
(We may disregard the fact that the determination of the task to be im- 
posed upon the various individuals wouId confront a socialist common- 
wealth with insoluble problems.) But how to deal with those sluggish and 


Work and Wages 

careless in the discharge of the imposed duties? There is no other way left 
than to punish them. In their superiors must be vested the authority to 
establish the offense, to give judgment on its subjective reasons, and to 
mete out punishment accordingly. A hegemonic bond is substituted for 
the contractual bond. The worker becomes subject to the discretionary 
power of his superiors, he is personally subordinate to his chief's disciplin- 
ary power. 

In the market economy the worker sells his services as other people sell 
their commodities. The employer is not the employee's lord. He is simply 
the buyer of services which he must purchase at their market price. Of 
course, like every other buyer an employer too can take liberties. But if he 
resorts to arbitrariness in hiring or discharging workers, he must foot the 
bill. An employer or an employee entrusted with the management of a de- 
partment of an enterprise is free to discriminate in hiring workers, to fire 
them arbitrarily, or to cut down their wages below the market rate. But in 
indulging in such arbitrary acts he jeopardizes the profitability of his 
enterprise or his department and thereby impairs his own income and his 
position in the economic system. In the market economy such whims bring 
their own punishment. The only real and effective protection of the wage 
earner in the market economy is provided by the play of the factors deter- 
mining the formation of prices. The market makes the worker independent 
of arbitrary discretion on the part of the employer and his aides. The 
workers are subject only to the supremacy of the consumers as their 
employers are too. In determining, by buying or abstention from buying, 
the prices of products and the employment of factors of production, con- 
sumers assign to each kind of labor its market price. 

What makes the worker a free man is precisely the fact that the em- 
ployer, under the pressure of the market's price structure, considers labor a 
commodity, an instrument of earning profits. The employee is in the eyes 
of the employer merely a man who for a consideration in money helps him 
to make money. The employer pays for services rendered and the etn- 
ployee performs in order to earn wages. There is in this relation between 
employer and employee no question of favor or disfavor. The hired man 
does not owe the employer gratitude; he owes him a definite quantity of 
work of a definite kind and quality. 

That is why in the market economy the employer can do without the 

power to punish the employee. All nonmarket systems of production must 

give to those in control the power to spur on the slow worker to more zeal 

and application. As imprisonment withdraws the worker from his job or 

at least reduces considerabIy the value of his contribution, corporal punish- 

ment has always been the classical means of keeping slaves and serfs to their 

work. With the abolition of unfree labor one could dispense with the whip 

as a stimulu6. Flogging was the symbol of bond labor. Members of a 

market society consider corporal punishment inhuman and humiliating to 

such a degree that it has been abolished also in the schools, in the penal 

code, and in military discipline. 


Human Action 

He who believes that a socialist commonwealth could do without com- 
pulsion and coercion against slothful workers because everyone will spon-
taneously do his duty, falls prey to the same illusions implied in the doctrine 
of anarchy. 


XXII. THE NONHUMAN ORIGINAL FACTORS 
OF PRODUCTION 

I. General Observations Concerning the Theory of Rent 
IN the frame of Ricardian economics the idea of rent was an attempt 

at a treatment of those problems which modern economics ap- 
proaches by means of marginal-utility ana1ysis.l Ricardo's theory ap- 
pears rather unsatisfactory when judged from the point of view of 
present-day insight; there is no doubt that the method of the 
subjective-value theory is far superior. Yet the renown of the rent 
theory is well deserved; the care bestowed upon its initiation and 
perfection brought forth fine fruits. There is no reason for the history 
of economic thought to feel ashamed of the rent the~ry.~ 

The fact that land of different quality and fertility, i.e., yielding 
different returns per unit of input, is valued differently does not pose 
any special problem to modern economics. As far as Ricardo's theory 
refers to the graduation in the valuation and appraisement of pieces 
of land, it is completely comprehended in the modern theory of the 
prices of factors of production. It is not the content of the rent theory 
that is objectionable, but the exceptional position assigned to it in 
the complex of the economic system. Differential rent is a general 
phenomenon and is not limited to the determination of the prices of 
Iand. The sophisticated distinction between "rents" and "quasi-rents" 
is spurious. Land and the services it renders are dealt with in the same 
way as other factors of production and their services. Control of a 
better tool yields "rentJ' when compared with the returns of less 
suitable tools which must be utilized on account of the insufficient 
supply of more suitable ones. The abler and more zealous worker 
earns a "rent" when compared with the wages earned by his less skill- 
ful and less industrious competitors. 

The problems which the rent concept was designed to solve were 
for the most part generated by the employment of inappropriate 

I. It was, says Fetter (Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, XIII, zgr), "a 
garbled margidity theory." 
2. Cf. Amonn, Ricardo als Begriinder der theoretischen Nationdokonomie 
(Jena, 19241, pp. 54 ff. 

Human Action 

terms. The general notions as used in everyday language and mundane 
thought were not formed with regard to the requirements of praxeo- 
logical and economic investigation. The early economists were mis- 
taken in adopting them without scruple and hesitation. Only if one 
clings na'ively to general terms such as land or labor, is one puzzled 
by the question why land and labor are differently valued and ap- 
paised. He who does not allow himself to be fooled by mere words, 
but looks at a factor's relevance for the satisfaction of human wants, 
considers it a matter of course that different services are valued and 
appraised differently. 

The modern theory of value and prices is not based on the classifi- 
cation of the factors of production as land, capital, and labor. Its 
fundamental distinction is between goods of higher and of lower 
orders, between producers' goods and consumers' goods. When it 
distinguishes within the class of factors of production the original 
(nature-given) factors from the produced factors of production (the 
intermediary products) and furthermore within the class of original 
factors the nonhuman (external) factors from the human factors 
(labor), it does not break up the uniformity of its reasoning concern- 
ing the determination of the prices of the factors of production. The 
law controlling the determination of the prices of the factors of pro- 
duction is the same with all classes and specimens of these factors. The 
fact that different services rendered by such factors are valued, ap- 
praised, and dealt with in a different way can only amaze people who 
fail to notice these differences in serviceableness. He who is blind to 
the merits of a painting may consider it strange that collectors should 
pay more for a painting of Velasquez than for a painting of a less 
gifted artist; for the connoisseur it is self-evident. It does not astonish 
the farmer that buyers pay higher prices and tenants higher leases for 
more fertile land than for less fertile. The only reason why the old 

economists were puzzled by this fact was that they operated with a 
aeneral term land that negIects differences in productivity. 

D 


The greatest merit of the Ricardian theory of rent is the cognizance 
of the fact that the marginal land does not yield any rent. From this 
knowledge there is but one step to the discovery of the principle of 
valuational subjectivism. Yet blinded by the real cost notion neither 
the classical economists nor their epigones took this step. 

While the differential-rent idea, by and large, can be adopted by 
the subjective-value theory, the second rent concept derived from 
Ricardian economics, viz., the residual-rent concept, must be rejected 
altogether. This residual-claimant idea is based on the notion of real 
or physical costs that does not make any sense in the frame of the 


Nonhuman Original Factors of Production 63 3 

modern explanation of the prices of factors of production. The reason 
why the price of Burgundy is higher than that of Chianti is not the 
higher price of the vineyards of Burgundy as against those of Tuscany. 
The causation is the other way around. Because people are ready to 
pay higher prices for Burgundy than for Chianti, winegrowers are 
ready to pay higher prices for the vineyards of Burgundy than for 
those of Tuscany. 

Profits are not a share left over when all costs of production have 
been paid. In the evenly rotating economy such a surplus of the prices 
of products over and above costs could never appear. In the changing 
economy differences between the prices of the products and the sum 
of the prices that the entrepreneur has expended for the purchase of 
the complementary factors of production plus interest on the capital 
invested can appear in either direction, i.e., either as profit or as loss. 
These differences are caused by changes which arise in the prices of 
the products in the time interval. He who succeeds better than others 
in anticipating these changes in time and acts accordingly, reaps 
profits. He who fails in his endeavors to adjust his entrepreneurial 
ventures to the future state of the market is penalized by losses. 

The main deficiency of Ricardian economics was that it was a 
theory of the distribution of a total product of a nation's joint efforts. 
Like the other champions of classical economics Ricardo failed to 
frce himself from the Mercantilist image of the Volkswirtschaft. In 
his thought the problem of the determination of prices was sub- 
ordinated to the problem of the distribution of wealth. The customary 
characterization of his economic philosophy as "that of the manu- 
facturing middle classes of contemporary England" " misses the point. 
These English businessmen of the early nineteenth century were not 
interested in the total product of industry and its distribution. They 
were guided by the urgc to make profits and to avoid losscs. 

Classical economics erred whcn it assigned to Iand a distinct place 

in its theoretical scheme. Land is, in the economic sense, a factor of 

production, and the Iaws determining the formation of the prices of 

Iand are the same that determine the formation of the prices of other 

factors of production. All peculiarities of the economic teachings con- 

cerning land refer to some peculiarities of the data involved. 

3. Cf., for example, Haney, History of Economic Thought (rev. ed. New 
York, 1927), p. 275. 

Human Action 

1. The Time Factor in Land Utilization 
The starting point of the economic teachings concerning land is 
the distinction between two classes of original factors of production, 
viz., human and nonhuman factors. As the utilization of the non-
human factors is as rule connected with the power to utilize a piece 
of the earth, we speak of land when referring to them.4 

In dealing with the economic problems of land, i.e., the nonhuman 
original factors of production, one must neatly separate the praxeo- 
logical point of view from the cosmological point of view. It may 
make good sense for cosmology in its study of cosmic events to speak 
of permanency and of the conservation of mass and energy. If one 
compares the orbit within which human action is able to affect the 
naturaI environmental conditions of human life with the operation 
of natural entities, it is permissible to call the natural powers inde- 
structible and permanent or-more precisely-safe against destruc- 
tion by human action. For the great periods of time to which cos- 
inology refers, soil erosion (in the broadest sense of the term) of such 
an intensity as can be effected by human interference is of no im- 
portance. Nobody knows today whether or not cosmic changes will 
in millions of years transform deserts and barren soil into land that 
from {he point of view of our present-day knowledge will have to 
be described as extremely fertile and the most luxuriant tropical 
gardens into sterile land. Precisely because nobody can anticipate 
such changes nor venture to influence the cosmic events which pos- 
sibly could bring them about, it is supererogatory to spec~ilate about 
them in dealing with the problems of human action." 

The natural sciences may assert that those powers of thc soil that 
condition its serviceableness for forestry, cattle breeding, agriculture, 
and water utilization regenerate themselves periodically. It may be 
true that even human endeavors deliberately directed toward the ut- 
most devastation of the productive capacity of the earth's crust could 
at best succeed only with regard to small parts of it. But these facts do 
not strictly count for human action. The periodical regeneration 
of the soil's productive powers is not a rigid datum that would face 
man with a uniquely determined situation. It is possible to use the soil 
in such a way that this regeneration is slowed down and postponed or 

4. Legal provisions concerning the separation of the right of hunting, fishing, 
and extracting mineral deposits from the other rights of the owner of a piece of 
land are of no interest for catallactics. The term land as used in catallactics in-
cludes also expanses of water. 
5. Thus also the problem of entropy stands outside of the sphere of praxeologi- 
cal meditation. 

Nonhuman Orighal Factors of Production 


the soil's productive power either vanishes altogether for a definite 
period of time or can only be restored by means of a considerable 
input of capital and labor. In dealing with the soil man has to choose 
between various methods different from one another with regard to 
the preservation and regeneration of its productive power. No less 
than in any other branch of production, the time factor enters also 
into the conduct of hunting, fishing, grazing, cattle breeding, plant 
growing, lumbering and water utilization. Here too man must choose 
between satisfaction in nearer and in more remote periods of the 
future. Here too the phenomenon of originary interest, entailed in 
every human action, plays its paramount role. 

There are institutional conditions that cause the persons involved to 
prefer satisfaction in the nearer future and to disregard entirely or al- 
most entirely satisfaction in the more distant future. If the soil is on 
the one hand not owned by individual proprietors and on the other 
hand all, or certain people favored by special privilege or by the actual 
state of affairs, are free to make use of it temporarily for their own 
benefit, no heed is paid to the future. The same is the case when the 
proprietor expects that he will be expropriated in a not too distant 
future. In both cases the actors are exclusively intent upon squeezing 
out as much as possible for their immediate advantage. They do not 
concern themselves about the temporally more remote consequences 
of their net hods of exploitation. Tomorrow does not count for them. 
The history of lumbering, hunting, and fishing provides plenty of il-
lustrative experience; but many examples can also be found in other 
branches of soil utilization. 

From the point of view of the natural sciences, the maintenance of 
capital goods and the preservation of the powers of the soil belong to 
two entirely different categories. The produced factors of production 
perish sooner or later entirely in the pursuit of production processes, 
and piecemeal are transformed into consumers' goods which are 
eventually consumed. If one does not want to make the results of 
past saving and capital accumulation disappear, one must, apart from 
consumers' goods, also produce that amount of capital goods which is 
needed for the replacement of those worn out. If one were to neglect 
this, one would finally consume, as it were, the capital goods. One 
would sacrifice the future to the present; one would live in luxury 
today and be in want later. 

But, it is often said, it is different with the powers of land. They 

cannot: be consumed. Such a statement is meaningful, however, only 

from the point of view of geology. But from the geological point of 

view one could, or should, no less deny that factory equipment or a 


Human Action 

railroad can be "eaten up." The gravel and stones of a railroad's sub- 
structure and the iron and steel of the rails, bridges, cars, and engines 
do not perish in a cosmic sense. Only from the praxeological point of 
view is it permissible to speak of the consumption, the eating up, 
of a tool a railroad, or a steel mill. In the same economic sense we 
speak of the consumption of the productive powers of the soil. In 
forestry, agriculture, and water utilization these powers are dealt with 
in the same way as other factors of production. With regard to the 
powers of the soil, too, the actors must choose between processes of 
production which render higher output at the expense of productivity 
in later periods and processes which do not impair future physical 
productivity. It is possible to extract so much from the soil that its 
later utilization will render smaller returns (per unit of the quantities 
of capital and labor employed) or practically no returns at all. 

It is true that there are physical limits to the devastating powers of 
man. (These limits are sooner reached in lumbering, hunting, and 
fishing than in tilling the soil.) But this fact results only in a quantita- 
tive, not in a qualitative difference between capital decumulation and 
soil erosion. 

Ricardo calls the powers of the soil "original and indestructible." 
However, modern economics must stress the point that valuation and 
appraisement do not differentiate between original and produced 
factors of production, and that the cosmological indestructibility of 
mass and energy, whatever it may mean, does not enjoin upon land 
utilization a character radically different from other branches of 
production. 

3. The Submarginal Land 
The services a definite piece of land can render in a definite period 
of time are limited. If they were unlimited, men would not consider 
land a factor of production and an economic good. However, the 
quantity of soii available is so vast, nature is so prodigai, that iand is 
still abundant. Therefore, only the most productive pieces of land 
are utilized. There is land which people consider-either with regard 
to its physical productivity or with regard to its location-as too poor 
to be worth cultivating. Consequently the marginal soil, i.e., the 
poorest soil cultivated, yields no rent in the Ricardian sense.7 Sub- 
marginal land would be considered entirely worthless if one were 

6. Ricardo, Principles of Political Economy and taxation^ p. 34. 
7. There are areas in which practically every corner is cultivated or otherwise 
utilized. But this is the outcome of institutional conditions barring the inhabitants 
of these regions from access to more fertile unused soil. 

Nonhunza7z Original Factors of Production 637 

not to appraise it positively in anticipation of its being utilized in 
later days.% 

The fact that the market economy does not have a more ample 
supply of agricultural products is caused by the scarcity of capital 
and labor, not by a scarcity of cultivable land. An increase in the 
surface of land available would-other things being equal-increase 
the supply of cereals and meat only if the additional land's fertility 
exceeded that of the marginal land already previously cultivated. On 
the other hand, the supply of agricultural products would be increased 
by any increase in the amount of labor and capital available, ~rovided 
the consumers do not consider another employment of the additional 
amounr of capital and labor more appropriate to fill their most urgent 

ants.^ 

The usefuI mineral substances contained in the soil are Iimited in 
quantity. It is true that some of them are the outgrowth of natural 
processes which are still going on and increasing the existing deposits. 
However, the slowness and length of these processes makes them in- 
significant for human action. Man must take into account that the 
available deposits of these minerals are limited, Every single mine or 
oiI source is eshaustible; many of them are already exhausted. We 
may hope that new deposits will be discovered and that technological 
procedures will be invented which will make it possible to utilize de- 
posits which today cannot be exploited at all or only at unreasonable 
costs. We may also assume that the further progress of technological 
knowledge will enable later generations to utilize substances which 
cannot be utilized today. But all these things do not matter for the 
present-day conduct of mining and oil drilling. The deposits of 
mineral substances and their exploitation are not characterized by 
features which would give a particular mark to human action dealing 
with them. For catallactics the distinction between soil used in agri- 
culture and that used in mining is merely a distinction of data. 

Although the available quantities of these mineral substances are 

limited, and although we may academically concern ourselves with 

the possibility that they will-be entirely exhausted one day, acting 

men do not consider these deposits rigidly limited. Their activities 

take into account the fact that definite mines and wells will become 

exhausted, hut they do not pay heed to the fact that at an unknown 

8. The appraisal of a piece of soiI must not be confused with the appraisal of 
the improvements, i.e., the irremovable and inconvertible results of the invest- 
ment of capital and labor that facilitate its utilization and raise future outputs per 
unit of current future inputs. 
9. These observations, of course, refer only to conditions in which there are no 
institutional barriers to the mobility of capital and labor. 

Human Action 

later date all the deposits of certain minerals may come to an end. 
For to present-day action the supply of these substances appears to 
be so abundant that one does not venture to exploit all their deposits 
to the full extent which the state of technological knowledge per- 
mits. The mines are utilized only as far as there is no more urgent 
employment available for the required quantities of capital and labor. 
There are therefore submarginal deposits that are not utilized at all. 
In every mine operated the extent of the production is determined 
by the relation between the prices of the products and those of the 
required nonspecific factors of production. 

4. The Land as Standing Room 
The employment of land for the location of human residences, 
workshops, and means of transportation withdraws pieces of soil 
from other employments. 

The particular place which older theories attributed to urban site 
rent need not here concern us. It is not especially noteworthy that 
people pay higher prices for land they value more for housing than 
for land which they value less. It is a matter of fact that for workshops, 
warehouses, and railroad yards people prefer locations which reduce 
costs of transportation, and that they are ready to pay higher prices 
for such land in accordance with the economies expected. 

Land is also used for pkasure grounds and gardens, for parks and 
for the enjoyment of the grandeur and beauty of nature. With the 
development of the love of nature, this very characteristic feature 
of "bourgeois" mentality, the demand for such enjoyments increased 
enormously. The soil of the high mountain chains. once merely con- 
sidered a barren dreariness of rocks and glaciers, is today highly 
appreciated as the source of the most lofty pleasures. 

From time immemorial access to these spaces has been free to 
everybody. Even if the land is owned by private individuals, the 
owners as a ruie have not the right to ciose it to tourists and mountain- 
climbers or to ask an entrance fee. Whoever has the opportunity to 
visit these areas, has the right to enjoy a11 their grandeur, and to con- 
sider them his own, as it were. The nominal owner does not derive 
any advantage from the satisfaction his property gives to the visitors. 
But this does not alter the fact that this land serves human well-being 
arid is appreciated accordingly. The ground is subject to an easement 
that entitles everybody to pass along and to camp on it. As no other 
utilization of the area concerned is possible, this servitude completely 
exhausts all the advantages the proprietor could reap from his owner- 


Nonhuman Original Factors of Production 639 

ship. Since the particular services which these rocks and glaciers can 
render are practically inexhaustible, do not wear out, and do not re- 
quire any input of capital and labor for their conservation, this ar- 
rangement does not bring about those consequences which appeared 
wherever it was applied to lumbering, hunting, and fishing grounds. 

If, in the neighborhood of these mountain chains, the space available 
for the construction of sl~elters, hotels, and means of transportation 
(e.g., rack railroads) is limited, the owners of these scarce pieces of 
soil can sell or rent them on more propitious terms and thus divert to 
themselves a part of the advantages the tourists reap from the free 
accessibility of the peaks. If this is not the case, the tourists enjoy all 
these advantages gratuitously. 

5. The Prices of Land 
In the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy 
buying and selling of the services of definite pieces of land does not 
differ at all from buying and selling the services of other factors of 
production. All these factors are appraised according to the services 
they will render in various periods of the future, due aIlowance being 
made for time preference. For the marginal land (and, of course, 
for the submarginal land) no price is paid at all. Rent-bearing land 
(i.e., land that, compared with the marginal land, bears a higher output 
per unit of input of capital and labor) is appraised in accordance with 
the degree of its superiority. Its price is the sum of all its future rents, 
each of them discounted at the rate of originary interest.1° 

In the changing economy people buying and selling land take due 
account of expected changes in the market prices for the services 
rendered by the soil. Of course, they may err in their expectations; 
but this is another thing. 'They try to anticipate to the best of their 
abilities future events that may alter the market data and they act 
in accordance with these opinions. If they believe that the annual net 
yield of the piece of land concerned will rise, the price will be higher 
than it would have been in the absence of such expectations. This is, 

10. There is nced to remember again that the imaginary construction of the 
evenly rotating economy cannot be carried consistently to its ultimate logical 
consequences (sec above, p. 249).With regard to thc problems of land one must 
stress two points: First, that in the framc of this imaginary construction, char- 
acterized by the absence of changes in the conduct of affairs, there is no room 
for the buying and selling of land. Second, that in order to integrate into this 
construction mining and oil drilling we must ascribe to the mines and oil wells a 
permanent character and must disregard the possibiIity that any of the operated 
mines and wells could be exhausted or evcn undergo 3 change in the quanfity of 
output or of current input required. 

Human Action 

for instance, the case with suburban land in the neighborhood of cities 
growing in population or with forests and arable land in countries in 
which pressure groups are likely to succeed in raising, by means of 
tariffs, the prices of timber and cereals. On the other hand, fears con- 
cerning the total or partial confiscation of the net yield of land tend 
to lower the prices of land. In everyday business language people 
speak of the "capitalization" of the rent and observe that the rate of 
capitalization is different with different classes of land and varies even 
within the same class with different pieces of soil. This terminology 
is rather inexpedient as it n~isrepresents the nature of the process. 

In the same way in which buyers and sellers of land take into 
account anticipated future event; that wiII reduce the net return, 
they deal with taxes. Taxes levied upon land reduce its market price 
to the extent of the discounted amount of their future burden. The 
introduction of a new tax of this kind which is likely not to be abol- 
ished results in an immediate drop in the market price of the pieces of 
land concerned. This is the phenomenon that the theory of taxation 
calls amortization of taxes. 

In many countries the owners of land or of certain estates enjoyed 
special political legal privileges or a great social prestige. Such in- 
stitutions too can play a role in the determination of the prices of land. 

The Myth of the Soil 

Romanticists condemn the economic theories concerning land for their 
utilitarian narrow-mindedness. Economists, they say, look upon land from 
the point of view of the callous speculator who degrades all eternal values 
to terms of money and profit. Yet, the glebe is ~nuch more than a mere 
factor of production. It is the inexhaustible source of human energy and 
human life. Agriculture is not simply one branch of production anlong 
many other branches. It is the only natural and respectable activity of man, 
the only dignified condition of a really human existence. It is iniquitous to 
judge it merely with regard to the net returns to be squeezed out of the 
soil. The soil not only bears the fruits that nourish our body; it produces 
first of all the moral and spiritual forces of civilization. The cities, the 
processing industries, and commerce are phenomena of depravity and de- 
cay; their existence is parasitic; they destroy what the ploughman must 
create again and again. 

Thousands of years ago, when fishing and hunting tribesmen began to 
cultivate the soil, romantic reverie was unknown. But if there had lived 
romanticists in those ages, they would have eulogized the lofty moral 
values of the hunt and would have stigmatized soil cultivation as a phe- 
nomenon of depravity. They would have reproached the ploughman for 


Nonhuman Original Factors of Production 

desecrating the soil that the gods had given to man as a hunting ground 
and for degrading it to a means of production. 

In the preromantic ages in his actions tio one considered the soil as any- 
thing other than a source of human well-being, a tneans to promote welfare. 
The magic rites and observances concerning the soil aimed at nothing else 
than improvement of the soil's fertility and increase in the quantity of 
fruits to be harvested. These people did not seek the unio mystica with 
the tnysterious powers and forces hidden in the soil. A11 they aimed at was 
bigger and better crops. They resorted to magic rituals and adjurations 
because in their opinion this was the most efficient method of attaining 
the ends sought. Their sophisticated progeny erred when they interpreted 
these ceremonies from an "idealistic" point of view. Areal peasant does 
not indulge in ecstatic babble about the soil and its mysterious powers. 
For him land is a factor of production, not an object of sentimental emo- 
tions. He covets more land because he desires to increase his income and to 
improve his standard of living. Farmers buy and sell land and mortgage it; 
they sell the produce of land and become very indignant if the prices are 
not as high as they want them to be. 

Love of nature and appreciation of the beauties of the landscape were 
foreign to the rural population. The inhabitants of the cities brought them 
to the countryside. It was the city-dwellers who began to appreciate the 
land as nature, while the countrymen valued it only from the point of view 
of its productivity for hunting, lumbering, crop raising and cattle breeding. 
From time immemorial the rocks and glaciers of the Alps were merely 
waste land in the eyes of the mountaineers. Only when the townsfolk ven- 
tured to climb the peaks, and brought money into the valleys, did they 
change their minds. The pioneers of mountain climbing and skiing were 
ridiculed by the indigenous population until they found out that they could 
derive gain from this eccentricity. 

Kot shepherds, but sophisticated aristocrats and city-dwellers were the 
authors of bucolic poetry. Daphnis and Chloe are creations of fancies far 
removed from earthy concerns. No less removed from the soil is the 
modern political myth of the soil. It did not blossom from the moss of the 
forests and the loam of the fields, but from the pavements of the cities and 
the carpets of the salons. The farmers make use of it because they find it a

XXIII. THE DATA OF THE MARKET 
C 
C 
I. The Theory and the Data 
ATALLACTICS,
the theory of the market economy, is not a system 

of theorems vaIid only under ideal and unrealizable conditions 
and applicable to reality merely with essential restrictions and modi- 
fications. All the theorems of catallactics are rigidly and without 
any exception valid for all phenomena of the market economy, pro- 
vided the particular conditions which they presuppose are present. 
It is, for instance, a sinlple question of fact whether there is direct or 
indirect cxchange. But where there is indirect exchange, all the gcneral 
laws of the theory of indirect exchange arc valid with regard to the 
acts of exchange and the media of exchange. As has been pointed out," 
praxeological knowledge is precise or exact knowledge of reality. All 
references to the epistemological issues of the natural sciences and all 
analogies derived from cornparing these two radically different realms 
of reality and cognition are misleading. There is, apart from formal 
logic, no such thing as a set of "methodological" rules applicable both 
to cognition by means of the category of causality and to that by 
means of the category of finality. 

Praxcology deals with human action as such in a general and univcr- 
sal way. It deals neither with the particular conditions of the environ- 
ment in which man acts nor with the concrete content of the valua- 
tions which direct his actions. For praxeology data are the bodily and 
psychological features of the acting men, their desires and value judg- 
ments, and the theories, doctrines, and ideologies they develop in order 
to adjust themselves purposively to the conditions of their environ- 
ment and thus to attain the cnds they are aiming at. These data, al- 
though permanent in their structure and strictly determined by the 
laws controlling the order of the universe, are perpetually fluctuating 
and varying; they change from instant to instant." 

The fullness of reality can be mentally mastered only by a mind 
resorting both to the conception of praxeology and to the under- 

r. See above, p. 39.

schaft (Jena,rgzj), pp. 18ff. 

The Dnta of the Market 

standing of history; and the latter requires command of the teachings 
of the natural sciences. Cognition and prediction are provided by 
the totality of knowledge. What the various single branches of science 
offer is always fragmentary; it must be complemented by the results 
of all the other branches. From the point of view of acting man the 
specialization of knowledge and its breaking up into the various sci- 
ences is merely a device of the division of labor. In the same way in 
which the consumer utilizes the products of various branches of 
production, the actor must base his decisions on knowledge brought 
about by various branches of thought and investigation. 

It is not permissible to disregard any of these branches in dealing 
with reality. The Historical School and the Institutionalists want to 
outlaw the study of praxeology and economics and to occupy them- 
selves merely with the registration of the data or, as they call them 
nowadays, the institutions. But no statement concerning these data 
can be made without reference to a definite set of economic theorems. 
When an institutionalist ascribes a definite event to a definite cause, 
e.g., mass unemployment to the alleged deficiencies of the capitalist 
mode of production, he resorts to an economic theorem. In objecting 
to the closer examination of the theorem tacitly implied in his con- 
clusions, he merely wants to avoid the exposure of the fallacies of his 
argument. There is no such thing as a mere recording of unadulterated 
facts apart from any reference to theories. As soon as tw-o events are 
recorded together or integrated into a class of events, a theory is 
operative. The question whether there is any connection between them 
can only be answered by a theory, i.e., in the case of human action 
by praxeology. It is vain to search for coefficients of correlation if one 
does not start from a theoretical insight acquired beforehand. The co- 
efficient may have a high numerical value without indicating any sig- 
nificant and relevant connection between the two gro~ps.~ 

2. The Role of Power 
The Historical School and Institutionalism condemn economics 
for disregarding the role which power plays in real life. The basic 
notion of economics, viz., the choosing and acting individual, is, 
they say, an unrealistic concept. Real man is not free to choose and 
to act. He is subject to social pressure, to the sway of irresistible power. 
It is not the individuals' value judgments, but the interactions of the 
forces of power that determine the market phenomena. 

3. Cf. Cohen and Nagel, An Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method 
(New York, 1939)~pp. 316322. 

Human Action 

These objections are no less spurious than all other statements of 
the critics of economics. 

Praxeology in general and economics and catallactics in particular 
do not contend or assume that man is free in any metaphysical sense 
attached to the term freedom. Man is unconditionally subject to the 
natural conditions of his environment. In acting he must adjust hirn- 
self to the inexorable regularity of natural phenomena. It is precisely 
the scarcity of the nature-given conditions of his welfare that cnjoins 
upon man the necessity to act.' 

In acting man is directed by ideologies. He chooses ends and means 
under the influence of ideologies. The might of an ideology is either 
direct or indirect. It is direct when the actor is convinced that the 
content of the ideology is correct and that he serves his own interests 
directly in complying with it. It is indirect when the actor rejects the 
content of thc ideology as false, but is under the necessity of adjusting 
his actions to the fact that this ideology is endorsed by other people. 
The mores of their social environment are a power xvhich people 
are forced to consider. Those recognizing the spuriousness of the 
generally accepted opinions and habits must in each instance choose 
between the advantages to be derived from resorting to a more effi- 
cient mode of acting and the disadvantages resulting from the con- 
tempt of popular prejudices, superstitions, and folkways. 

The same is true with regard to violence. In choosing man must 
take into account the fact that there is a factor ready to exercise violent 
compulsion upon him. 

All the theorems of catallactics are valid also with regard to actions 
influenced by such social or physical pressure. The direct or indirect 
might of an ideology and the threat of physical compulsion are merely 
data of the market situation. It does not matter, for instance, what 
kind of considerations motivate a man not to offer a higher bid for 
the purchase of a commodity than the one he really makes without 
obtaining the good concerned. For the determination of the marlrct 
price it is immaterial whether he spontaneously prefers to spend his 
money for other purposes or whether he is afraid of being looked 
upon by his fellow men as an upstart, or as a spendthrift, afraid of 

4. Most social reformers, foremost among them Fourier and Marx, pass over in 
silence the fact that the nature-given means of removing human uneasiness are 
scarce. As they see it, the fact that there is not an abundance of all useful things 
is merely caused by the inadequacy of the capitalist node of production and will 
therefore disappear in the "higher phase" of communism. An eminent Menshevik 
author who could not help referring to the nature-given barriers to human well- 
being, in genuineIy Marxian style, calls Nature "the most relentless exploiter." 
Cf. Mania Gordon, Workers Before and After Lenin (New York, 1941), pp. 227, 
458.

violating a government-decreed ceiling price or of defying a competi- 
tor ready to resort to violent revenge. In any case his abstention from 
bidding a higher price contributes to the same extent to the emergence 
of the market price." 

It is customary nowadays to signify the position which the owners 
of property occupy on the ~narket as economic power. The ex- 
pediency of this terminology is questionable. The term is at any rate 
inappropriate as far as it is intended to imply that under the impact 
of econon~ic power the determination of the market phenomena is 
controlled by laws other than those dealt with by catallactics. 

3. The Historical Role of War and Conquest 
Many authors glorify war and revolution, bloodshed and conquest. 
Carlyle and Ruskin, Nietzsche, Georges Sorel, and Spengler were 
harbingers of the ideas which Lenin and Stalin, Hitler and hlussolini 
put into effect. 

The course of history, say these phiIosophies, is not determined 
by the mean activities of materialistic peddlers and merchants, but 
by the heroic deeds of warriors and conquerors. The economists 
err in abstracting from the experience of the short-lived liberal 
episode a theory to which they ascribe universal validity. This epoch 
of liberalism, individualism, and capitalism; of democracy, toIerance, 
and freedom; of the disregard of all "true" and "eternal" values; and 
of the supremacy of the rabble is now vanishing and will never return. 
The dawning age of manliness requires a new theory of human action. 

However, no economist ever ventured to deny that war and con- 
quest were of utmost importance in the past and that Huns and Tar- 
tars, Vandals and Vikings, Normans and conquistadors played an 
enormous part in history. One of the determinants of the present state 
of mankind is the fact that there were thousands of years of armed 
conflicts. Yet, what remains and is the essence of human civilization, 
is not the legacy inherited from the warriors. Civilization is an achieve- 
ment of the "bourgeois" spirit, not of the spirit of conquest. Those 
barbarian peoples who did not substitute working for plundering 
disappeared from the historical scene. If there is still any trace left 
of their existence, it is in the achievements they accomplished under 
the influence of the civilization of the subdued peoples. Latin civiliza- 
tion survived in Italy, France, and the Iberian peninsula in defiance 
of all barbarian invasions. If capitalist entrepreneurs had not succeeded

coercion with the market phenomena are dealt with in the sixth part of this book. 

Human Action 
Lord Clive and Warren Hastings, British rule in India might one day 
becol-ne such an insignificant historical reminiscence as are the one 
hundred and fifty years of Turkish rule in Hungary. 
It is not the task of economics to enter into an examination of the 
endeavors to revive the ideals of the Vikings. It has merely to refute 
the statements that the fact that there are armed conflicts reduces its 
teachings to nought. W7ith regard to this problem there is need to 
emphasize again the following: 
I;irst: The teachings of catallactics do not refer to a definite epoch 
of history, but to a11 actions characterized by the two conditions 
private ou;nershi+ of the nzeans of production and division of labor. 
Whenever and wherever, in a society in which there is private owner- 
ship of the means of production, peopIe not only produce for the 
direct satisfaction of their own wants but also consume goods pro- 
duced by other people, the theorems of catallactics are strictly valid. 
Second: If apart from the market and outside of the market there 
is robbing and plundering, these facts are a datum for the market. The 
actors must take into account the fact that they are threatened by 
murderers and robbers. If killing and robbing become so prcvalent 
that any production appears useless, it may finally happen that pro- 
ductive work ceases and mankind plunges into a state of war of 
every man against every other man. 
Third: In order to seize booty, something to be plundered must 
be available. The heroes can only live if there are enough "bourgeois" 
to be expropriated. The existence of producers is a condition for the 
survival of conquerors. But the producers could do without the 
plunderers. 
Fourth: There are, of course, other imaginable systems of a society 
based on the division of labor besides the capitalist system of private 
ownership of the means of production. Champions of militarism are 
consistent in asking for the establishment of socialism. 'The whole 
nation should be organized as a community of warriors in which the 
noncombatants have no other task than that of suppiying the fighting 
forces with all they need. (The problems of socialism are dealt with 
in the fifth part of this book.) 

4. Real Man as a Datum 
Economics deals with the real actions of real men. Its theorems 
refer neither to ideal nor to perfect men, neither to the phantom of 
a fabulous economic man (homo oeconomicus) nor to the statistical 
notion of an average man (homme moyen). Man with all his weak- 


The Data of the Market 

647 

msses and limitations, every man as he lives and acts, is the subject 
matter of catallactics. Every human action is a theme of praxeology. 

The subject matter of praxeology is not only the study of society, 
societal relations, and mass phenomena, but the study of all human 
actions. The term "the social sciences" and all its connotations are 
in this regard misleading. 

There is no yardstick that a scientific investigation can apply to 
human action other than that of the ultimate goals the acting individ- 
ual wants to realize in embarking upon a definite action. The ultimate 
goals themselves are beyond and abovc any criticism. Nobody is 
called upon to establish what could make another man happy. What 
an unaffected observer can question is merely whether or not the 
means chosen for the attainment of these ultimate goals are fit to 
bring about the results sought by the actor. Only in answering this 
question is economics free to express an opinion about the actions 
of individuals and groups of individuals, or of the policies of parties, 
pressure groups, and governments. 

It is customary to disguise the arbitrariness of the attacks launched 

against the value judgments of other people by converting them into 

a critique of the capitalist system or of the conduct of entrepreneurs. 

Economics is neutral with regard to a11 such statements. 

To the arbitrary statement that "the balance between the produc- 

tion of different goods is admittedly faulty under capitalism," e the 

economist does not oppose the statement that this balance is faultless. 

L 


What the economist asserts is that in the unhampered market economy 
this balance is in agreement with the conduct of the consumers as 
displayed in the spcnding of their inco~nes.~ 

It is not the task of the 

economist to censure his fellow men and to call the result of their 

actions faulty. 

The alternative to the system in wGch the individual's value judg-

ments are paramount in the conduct of production processes is auto- 

cratic dictatorship. Then the value judgments of the dictators alone 

decide although they are not less arbitrary than those of other people. 

Man is certainly not a perfcct being. His human weakness taints 

all human institutions and thus also the market economy.

5. The Period of Adjustment 
Every change in the market data has its definite effects upon the 
market. It takes a definite length of time before all these effects are 
consummated, i.e., before the market is compIetely adjusted to the 
new state of affairs. 

Catallactics has to deal with all the various individuals' conscious 
and purposive reactions to the changes in the data and not, of course, 
merely with the final result brought about in the market structure by 
the interplay of these actiotls. It may happen that the effects of one 
change in the data are counteracted by the effects of another change 
occurring, by and large, at the same time and to the same extent. Then 
no considerable change in the market prices finally results. The 
statistician, exclusively preoccupied with the observation of mass 
phenomena and the outgrowth of the totality of market transactions 
as manifested in market prices, ignores the fact that the nonemergence 
of changes in the height of prices is merely accidental and not the 
outcome of a continuance in the data and the absence of specific ad- 
justment activities. He fails to see any movement and the social conse- 
quences of such movements. Yet each change in the data has it5 own 
course, generates certain reactive responses on the part of the individ- 
uals affected and disturbs the relation between the various merni)ess 
of the market system even if eventually no considerable changes in 
the prices of the various goods and no changes at all in the figures 
concerning the total amount of capital in the whole market system 
res~lt.~ 

Economic history can give vague information ex post factum about 
the length of adjustment periods. The method of attaining such in- 
formation is, of course, not measurement, but historical understanding. 
The various adjustment processes are in reality not isolated. Synchro- 
nously an indefinite number of them take their course, their paths 
intersect, and they mutually influence one another. To disentangle 
this intricate tissue and to observe the chain of actions and reactions 
set into motion by a definite change in the data is a difficult task for 
the historian's understanding and the results are mostly . .meager and 
questionable. 

The understanding of the length of adjustment periods is also the 
most difficult task incumbent upon those eager to understand the 
future, the entrepreneurs. Yet for success in entrepreneurial activities,

of money see above, p. 414. With regard to the decumulation and accumulation 
of capital see above, pp. 513-514. 

The Data of the Market

mere anticipation of the direction in which the market will react to 
a ccrtain event is of little significance if it is not supplemented bv an 
adequate anticipation of the length of the various adjustment pe;iods 
involved. Most of the mistakes committed by entrepreneurs in the 
conduct of affairs and most of the blunders vitiating the prognoses 
of future business trends on the part of "expert" forecasters arc caused 
by errors concerning the length of adjustment periods. 

In dealing with effects brought about by changes in the data, it 
is customary to distinguish between the temporally nearer and the 
temporally remoter effects, viz., the short-run effects and the long- 
run effects. This distinction is much older than the terminology in 
which it is expressed nowadays. 

In order to discover the immediate-the short-run-effects brought 
about by a change in a datum, there is as a rule no need to resort to a 
thorough investigation. The short-run effects are for the most part 
obvious and seldom escape the notice of a na'ive observer unfamiliar 
with searching investigations. What started economic studies was 
precisely the fact that some men of genius began to suspect that the 
remoter consequences of an event may differ from the immediate 
effects visibIe even to the most simple-minded layman. The main 
achievement of economics was thc disclosure of such long-run effects 
hitherto unnoticed by the unaffected observer and neglected by the 
statesman. 

From their startling discoveries the classical economiscs derived a 
rule for political practice. Governments, statesmen, and political 
parties, they argued, in planning and acting should consider not 
only the short-run consequences but also the Iong-run consequences 
of their measures. The correctness of this inference is incontestable 
and indisputable. Action aims at the substitution of a more satisfacrory 
state of affairs for a less satisfactory. Whether or not the outcome 
of a definite action will be considered more or less satisfactory de- 
pends on a correct anticipation of a11 its consequences, both short 
run and long run. 

Some people criticize economics for alleged neglect of the short- 

run effects and for alleged preference given to the study of the Iong- 

run effects. The reproach is nonsensical. Economics has no means of 

scrutinizing the results of a change in the data other than to start 

with its immediate consequences and to analyze, step by step, pro- 

ceeding from the first reaction to the remoter reactions, all the sub- 

sequent consequences, until it finally arrives at its ultimate conse-

quences. The long-run analysis necessarily always fully includes 

the short-run analysis. 


Human Action 

It is easy to understand why certain individuals, parties, and pressure 
groups are eager to propagate the exclusive sway of the short-run 
principle. Politics, they say, should never be concerned about the 
long-run effects of a device and should never abstain from resorting to 
a measure from which benefits are expected in the short run merely 
because its long-run effects are detrimental. What counts is only the 
short-run effects; "in the long run we shall all be dead." All that 
economics has to answer to these passionate critics is that every de- 
cision should be based on a careful weighing of all its consequences, 
both those in the short run and those in the long run. There are 
certainly, both in the actions of individuals and in the conduct of 
public affairs, situations in which the actors may have good reasons 
to put up even with very undesirable long-run effects in order to 
avoid what they consider still more undesirable short-run conditions. 
It may sometimes be expedient for a man to heat the stove with his 
furniture. But if he does, he should know what the remoter effects will 
be. He should not delude himself by believing that he has discovered 
a wonderful new method of heating his premises. 

That is all that economics need oppose to the frenzy of the short- 
run apostIes. History, one day, will have to say much more. It will 
have to establish the role that the recommendation of the short-run 
principle-this revival of Madame de Pompadour's notorious phrase 
apr2s nous le de'luge-played in the most serious crisis of Western 
civilization. It will have to show how weIcome this slogan was to 
governments and parties whose policies aimed at the consumption of 
the spiritual and material capital inherited from earlier generations. 

6. The Limits of Property Rights and the Problems 
of External Costs and External Economies 
Property rights as they arc circumscribed by laws and protected 
by courts and the police, are the outgrowth of an age-long evolution. 
The history of these ages is the record of struggles aiming at the 
abolition of private properw. Again and again despots and popular 
movements have tried to restrict the rights of private property or to 
abolish it altogether. These endeavors, it is true, failed. But they have 
left traces in the ideas determining the legal form and definition of 
property. The legal concepts of property do not fully take account 
of the social function of private property. There are certain inade- 
quacies and incongruities which are reflected in the determination of 
the market phenomena. 

Carried through consistently, the right of property would entitle 


The Data of the Market 

the proprietor to claim all the advantages which the good's employ- 
ment may generate on the one hand and would burden him with all 
the disadvantages resulting from its employment on the other hand. 
Then the proprietor alone would be fully responsible for the out- 
come. In dealing with his property he would take into account all 
the expected results of his action, those considered favorable as well 
as those considered unfavorable. But if some of the consequences of 
his action are outside of the sphere of the benefits he is entitled to 
reap and of the drawbacks that are put to his debit, he will not bother 
in his planning about all the effects of his action. He will disregard 
those benefits which do not increase his own satisfaction and those 
costs which do not burden him. His conduct will deviate from the line 
which it would have followed if the laws were better adjusted to the 
economic objectives of privatc ownership. He wilI embark upon 
certain projects only because the laws release him from responsibility 
for some of the costs incurred. He will abstain from other projects 
merely because the laws prevent him from harvesting all the ad- 
vantages derivable. 

The laws concerning liability and indemnification for damages 
caused were and still are in sorne respects deficient. By and large the 
principle is accepted that everybody is liable to damages which his 
actions have inflicted upon other people. But there were loopholes 
left which the legislators were slow to fill. In sorne cases this tardiness 
was intentional because the imperfections agreed with the plans of 
the authorities. When in the past in many countries the owners of 
factories and railroads were not held liagle for the damages which 
the conduct of their enterprises inflicted on the property and health 
of neighbors, patrons, employees, and other people through smoke, 
soot, noise, water pollution, and accidents caused by defective or 
inappropriate equipment, the idea was that one should not undermine 
the progress of industrialization and the development of transporta- 
tion facilities. The same doctrines which prompted and srilI are 
prompting many governments to encourage investment in factories 
and railroads through subsidies, tax exemption, tariffs, and cheap credit 
were at work in the emergence of a legal state of affairs in which the 
liability of such enterprises was either formally or practically abated. 
Later again the opposite tendency began to prevail in many countries 
and the liability of manufacturers and railroads was ikreased as 
against that of other citizens and firms. Here again definite political 
objectives were operative. 1,egislators wished to protect the poor, 
the wage earners, and the peasants against the wealthy entrepreneurs 
and capitalists. 


Human Action 

Whcther the proprietor's relief from responsibility for somc of 
the disadvantages resulting from his conduct of affairs is the out- 
come of a deliberate policy on the part of governments and legislators 
or whether it is an unintentional effect of the traditional wording of 
laws, it is at any rate a datum which the actors must take into account. 
They are faced with the problem of external costs. Then some people 
choose certain modes of want-satisfaction merely on account of the 
fact that a part of the costs incurred are debited not to them but to 
other peopfe. 

The extreme instance is provided by the case of no-man's property 
referred to above.g If land is not owned by anybody, although legal 
formalism may call it public property, it is utilized without any regard 
to the disadvantages resulting. Those who are in a position to appro- 
priate to themselves the returns-lumber and game of the forests, 
fish of the water areas, and mineral deposits of the subsoil-do not 
bother about the later effects of their mode of exploitation. For them 
the erosion of the soil, the depletion of the exhaustible resources and 
other impairments of the future utilization are external costs not 
entering into their calculation of input and output. They cut dowm 
the trees without any regard for fresh shoots or reforestation. In hunt- 
ing and fishing they do not shrink from methods prcventing the re-
population of the hunting and fishing grounds. In the early days of 
human civilization, when soil of a quality not inferior to that of the 
utilized pieces was still abundant, people did not find any fault with 
such predatory methods. When their effects appeared in a decrease 
in the net returns, the ploughman abandoned his farm and moved 
to another place. It was only when a country was more densely 
settled and unoccupied first class land was no longer available for 
appropriation, that people began to consider such predatory methods 
wasteful. At that time they consolidated the institution of private 
property in land. They started with arable land and then, step by 
step, included pastures, forests, and fisheries. The newly settlcd 
colonial countries overseas, especially the vast spaces of the United 
States, whose marvelous agricultural potentialities were almost un- 
touched when the first colonists from Europe arrived, passed through 
the same stages. Until the last decades of the nineteenth century there 
was always a geographic zone open to newcomers-the frontier. 
Neither the existence of the frontier nor its passing was peculiar to 
America. What characterizes American conditions is the fact that at 
the time the frontier disappeared ideological and institutional factors 

9. See above, p. 63j. 

The Data of the Market 

impeded the adjustment of the methods of land utilization to the 
change in thc data. 

In the central and western areas of continental Europe, where the 
institution of private property had been rigidly established for many 
centuries, things were different. There was no question of soil erosion 
of formerly cultivated land. There was no problem of forest devasta- 
tion in spite of the fact that the domestic forests had been for ages 
the only source of lumber for construction and mining and of fuel 
for heating and for the foundries and furnaces, the potteries and the 
glass factories. The owners of the forests were impelled to conserva- 
tion by their own selfish interests. In the most densely inhabited and 
industrialized areas up to a few years ago between a fifth and a third 
of the s~~rfacc 

was still covered by first-class forests managed accord- 
ing to the methods of scientific forestry.1° 

It is not the task of catallactic theory to elaborate an account of the 
complex factors that produced modern American land-ownership 
conditions. Whatever these factors were, they brought about a state 
of affairs under which a great many farmers and the majority of the 
lumbering enterprises had reason to consider the disadvantages result- 
ing from the neglect of soil and forest conservation as external costs.ll 

It is true that where a considerable part of the costs incurred are 
external costs from the point of view of the acting individuals or 
firms, the economic cakulation established by them is manifestly de- 
fective and their results deceptive. But this is not the outcome of 
alleged deficiencies inherent in the system of private ownership of 
the means of production. It is on the contrary a consequence of loop- 
holes left in this system. It could be removed by a reform of the 
laws concerning liability for damages inflictcd and by rescinding the 
institutional barriers preventing the full operation of private owner- 
ship. 

10. Late in the eighteenth century European governments began to enact laws 
aiming at forest conservation. However, it would be a serious blunder to ascribe 
to these laws any role in the conservation of the forests. Before the middle of the 
nineteenth century there was no administrative apparatus available for their en- 
forcement. Besides the governments of Austria and Prussia, to say nothing of 
those of the smaller German states, virtually lacked the power to enforce such 
laws against the aristocratic lords. No civil servant before t914would have been 
bold enough to rouse the anger of a Bohemian or Silesian magnate or a German 
mediatized Standeshe~r.These princes and counts were spontaneously com-
mitted to forest conservation because they felt perfectly safe in the possession of 
their property and were eager to preserve unabated the source of their revenues 
and the market price of their estates. 
11. One could as well sav that they considered the advantages to be derived 
from giving care to soil and forest conservation external economies. 

Human Action 

The case of external economies is not simply the inversion of the 
case of external costs. It has its own domain and character. 

If the results of an actor's action benefit not only himseIf, but also 
other people, two alternatives are possible: 

I. The planning actor considers the advantages which he expects 
for himself so important that he is prepared to defray all the costs re- 
quired. The fact that his project also benefits other people will not pre- 
vent him from accomplishing what promotes his own well-being. 
When a railroad company erects dikes to protect its tracks against 
snowslides and avalanches, it also protects the houses on adjacent 
grounds. But the benefits which its neighbors will derive will not 
hinder the company from embarking upon an expenditure that it 
deems expedient. 
2. The costs incurred by a project are so great that none of those 
whom it will benefit is ready to expend them in full. The project can 
be realized only if a sufficient number of those interested in it share 
in the costs. 
It would hardly be necessary to say more about external economies 
if it were not for the fact that this phenomenon is entirely misinter- 
preted in currcnt pseudo-economic literature. 

A project P is unprofitable when and because consumers prefer the 
satisfaction expected from the realization of some other projects to 
the satisfaction expected from the realization of P. The realization 
of P would withdraw capital and labor from the realization of some 
other projects for which the demand of the consumers is more urgent. 
The layman and the pseudo-economist fail to recognize this fact. They 
stubbornly refuse to notice the scarcity of the factors of production. 
As they see it, P could be realized without any cost at all, i.e., without 
foregoing any other satisfaction. It is merely the wantonness of the 
profit system that prevents the nation from enjoying gratuitously the 
pleasures expected from P. 

Now, these short-sighted critics go on to say, the absurdity of the 
profit system becomes especially outrageous if the unprofitability of 
P is merely due to the fact that the entrepreneur's calculations neglect 
those advantages of P which for them are external economies. From 
the point of view of the whole of society such advantages are not 
external. They benefit at least some members of society and would 
increase "total welfare." 'The nonrealization of P is therefore a loss 
for society. As profit-seeking business, entircly committed to selfish- 
ness, declines to embark upon such unprofitabIe projects, it is the 
duty of government to fill the gap. Government should either run 
them as public enterprises or it should subsidize them in order to 


The Data of the Market 

65 5 

make them attractive for the private entrepreneur and investor. The 
subsidies may be granted either directly by money grants from public 
funds or indirectly by means of tariffs the incidcncc of which falls 
upon the buyers of the products. 

However, the means which a government needs in order to run a 
plant at a loss or to subsidize an unprofitable project must be with- 
drawn either from the taxpayers' spending and investing power or 
from the loan market. The government has no more ability than 
individuals to create something out of nothing. What the govcrnment 
spends more, the public spends Icss. Public works are not accomplished 
by the miraculous power of a magic wand. Thcy are paid for by funds 
taken away from the citizens. If the government had not intcrfcred, 
the citizens would have employed thcm for the realization of profit- 
promising projccts the realization of which they must omit because 
their means have been curtailcd by the government. For every un- 
profitable project that is realized by the aid of the government there 
is a corresponding project the realization of which is neglected inercly 
on account of the govcrnment's intervention. Yet this nonrealized 
projcct would have been profitable, i.e., it would have employed 
the scarce means of production in accordance with the most urgent 
needs of the consumers. From the point of view of the consumers the 
employment of these means of production for the realization of an 
unprofitable project is wasteful. It deprives thein of satisfactions which 
they prefer to those which the governmenc-sponsored project can 
furnish them. 

The gullible masses who cannot see beyond the immediate range of 

their physical eyes are enraptured by the marvelous accomplishments 

of their rulers. They fail to see that they themselves foot the bilI and 

must consequently renounce many satisfactions which they would 

have enjoyed if the governmcnt had spent less for unprofitable 

projects. They have not the imagination to think of the possibilities 

that the governmcnt has not allowed to come into exist~ncc.~~ 

Thcse enthusiasts are still more bewildered if the government's 

interference enables submarginal producers to continue producing 

and to stand the competition of more efficient plants, shops, or farms. 

Here, they say, it is obvious that total production is increased and 

something is added to the wealth that would not have been produced 

without the assistance of the authorities. What happens in fact is 

just the opposite; the magnitude of total production and of total wealth 

is curtailed. Outfits producing at higher costs are brought into exist- 

I 2. Cf. the brilliant analysis of public spending in Henry Hazlitt's book Eco-
nomics in One Lesson (New York, ly46), pp. 19-29. 


Human Action 

ence or preserved while other outfits producing at Iower costs are 
forced to curtail or to discontinue their production. The consumers 
are not getting more, but less. 

There is, for instance, the very popular idea that it is a good thing 
for the government to promote the agricultural development of those 
parts of the country which nature has poorly endowed. Costs of 
production are higher in these districts than in other areas; it is 
precisely this fact that qualifies a large part of their soil as submarginal. 
When unaided by public funds, the farmers tilling these submarginal 
lands could not stand the competition of the more fertile farms. 
Agriculture would shrink or fail to develop and the whole area would 
become a backward part of the country. In full cognizance of this 
state of affairs profit-seeking business avoids investing in the construc- 
tion of railroads connecting such inauspicious areas with the centers 
of consumption. The plight of the farmers is not caused by the fact 
that they lack transportation facilities. The causation is the other 
way round; because business realizes that the prospects for these 
farmcrs are not propitious, it abstains from investing in railroads which 
are likely to become unprofitable for lack of a sufficient amount of 
goods to be shipped. If the government, yielding to the demands of 
the interested pressure groups, builds the railroad and runs it at a 
deficit, it certainly benefits the owners of farm land in those poor 
districts of the country. As a part of the costs that the shipping of 
their products requires is borne by the treasury, they find it easier 
to compete with those tilling more fertile land to whom such aid 
is denied. But the boon of these privileged farmers is paid for by the 
taxpayers who must provide the funds required to defray the deficit. 
It affects neither the market price nor the total available supply of 
agricultural products. It merely makes profitable the operation of 
farms which hitherto were submarginal and makes other farms, the 
operation of which was hitherto profitable, submarginal. It shifts 
production from land requiring lower costs to land requiring higher 

costs. it does not increase totai suppiy and weaith, it curtalis them, 
as the additional amounts of capital and labor required for the cultiva- 
tion of high-cost fields instead of low-cost fields are withheld from 
enlploymcnts in which they would have made possible the production 
of some other consumers' goods. The government attains its end of 
benefiting some parts of the country with what they would have 
missed, but it produces somewhere else costs which exceed these 
gains of a privileged group. 


The Data of the Market 

The Externlrl Economies of Intellectual Creation 

The extreme case of external economies is shown in the "production" of 
the intellectua1 groundwork of every kind of processing and constructing. 
The characteristic mark of recipes, i.e., the mental devices directing the 
technological procedures, is the inexhaustibility of the services they render. 
These services are consequently not scarce, and there is no need to econo- 
mize their employment. Those considerations that resulted in the establish- 
ment of the institution of private ownership of economic goods did not 
refer to them. They remained outside the sphere of private property not 
because they are immaterial, intangible, and- impalpable, but because their 
serviceableness cannot be exhausted. 

People began to realize only later that this state of affairs has its draw- 
backs too. It places the producers of such recipes--cspeciaIly the inventors 
of technological procedures and authors and composers-in a peculiar 
position. They are burdened with the costs of production, while the serv- 
ices of the product they have created can be gratuitously enjoyed by 
everybody. What they produce is for them either entirely or almost en- 
tirely external economies. 

If there are neither copyrights nor patents, the inventors and authors 
are in the position of an entrepreneur. They have a temporary advantage 
as against other people. As they start sooner in utilizing their invention or 
their manuscript themselves or in making it available for use to other people 
(manufacturers or publishers), they have the chance to earn profits in the 
time interval until everybody can likewise utilize it. As soon as the inven- 
tion or the content of the book are publicIy known, they become "free 
goods" and the inventor or author has only his glory. 

The problem involved has nothing to do with the activities of the creative 
genius. These pioneers and originators of things unheard of do not produce 
and work in the sense in which these terms are employed in dealing with 
the affairs of other people. They do not let themselves be influenced by 
the response their work meets on the part of their contemporaries. They 
do not wait for encouragement.13 

It is different with the broad class of professional intellectuals whose 
scrvices socicq-caiiiiot do withotit 'iVe may disregard the of 
second-rate authors of poems, fiction, and plays and second-rate composers 
and need not inquire whether it would be a serious disadvantage for man- 
kind to lack the products of their efforts. But it is obvious that handing 
down knowledge to the rising generation and familiarizing the acting in- 
dividuals with the amount of knowledge they need for the realization of 
their plans requires textbooks, manuals, handbooks, and other nonfiction 
works. It is unlikely that people would undertake the laborious task of 
writing such publications if everyone were free to reproduce them. This is 
still more manifest in the field of technological invention and discovery. 

13. See above, pp. 138-140. 

Human Action 

The extensive experimentation necessary for such achievements is often 
very expensive. It is very probable that technological progress would be 
seriously retarded if, for the inventor and for those who defray the ex- 
penses incurred by his experimentation, the results obtained were nothing 
but externaI economies. 

Patents and copyrights are results of the legal evolution of the last cen- 
turies. Their place in the traditional body of property rights is still con- 
troversial. People look askance at them and deem them irregular. They 
are considered privileges, a vestige of the rudimentary period of their 
evolution when legal protection was accorded to authors and inventors 
only by virtue of an exceptional privilege granted by the authorities. They 
are suspect, as they arc lucrative only if they make it possible to sell at 
monopoly prices.14 Moreover, the fairness of patent laws is contested on 
the ground that they reward only those who put the finishing touch lead- 
ing to practical utilization of achievements of many predecessors. These 
precursors go empty-handed although their contribution to the final result 
was often much more weighty than that of the patentee. 

It is beyond the scope of catallactics to enter into an examination of the 
arguments brought forward for and against the institution of copyrights 
and patents. It has merely to stress the point that this is a problem of the 
delimitation of property rights and that with the abolition of patents and 
copyrights authors and inventors would for the most part be producers of 
external economies. 

Privileges and Quasi-privileges 

The restrictions which laws and institutions impose upon the discretion 
to choose and to act arc not always so insurmountable that they could not 
be overcome under certain conditions. To some favorites exemption from 
the obligation binding the rest of the people may be granted as an explicit 
privilege either by the laws themselves or by an administrative act of the 
authorities entrusted with the law's enforcement. Some may be ruthIess 
enough to defy the laws in spite of the vigilance of the authorities; their 
daring insolence secures them a quasi-privilege. 

A law that nobody observes is ineffectual. A law that is not valid for all 
or which not all obey, may grant to those who are exempt-whether by 
virtue of the law itself or by virtue of their own audacity-the opportunity 
to reap either differential rent or monopoly gains. 

With regard to the determination of the market phenomena it does not 
matter whether the exemption is legally valid as a privilege or illegal as a 
quasi-privilege. Neither does it matter whether the costs, if any, incurred 
by the favored individual or firm for the acquisition of the privilege or 
quasi-privilege are legal (e.g., a tax levied on licensees) or illegal (e.g., 
bribes paid to corrupt officers). If an importation embargo is mitigated by 
the importation of a certain quantity, the prices are affected by the quantity 

14. See above, pp. 360-361. 

The Data of the Market 

imported and the specific costs incurred by the acquisition and the utiliza- 
tion of the privilege or quasi-priyilege. But whether the importation was 
legal (e.g., a license granted under the system of quantitative trade control 
to some privileged people), or illegal contraband does not affect the price 
structure.

I. The Ultimate Source of Profit and Loss on the Market 
HE changes in the data whose reiterated emergence prevents the 
econoniic system from turning into an evenly rotating economy 
and produces again and again entrepreneurial profit and loss are favor- 
able to some members of society and unfavorable to others. Hence, 
people concluded, the gain of one nzan is the damage of another; no 
man profits but by the loss of others. This dogma was already ad- 
vanced by certain ancient authors. Among modern writers Montaigne 
was the first to restate it; we may fairly call it the Montnigne dogma. 
It was the quintessence of the doctrines of Mercantilism, old and 
new. It is at the bottom of all modern doctrines teaching that there 
prevails, within the frame of the market economy, an irreconcilable 
conflict among the interests of various social classes within a nation 
and furthermore between the interests of any nation and those of all 
other nati0ns.l 
Now the Montaigne dogma is true with regard to the effects of 
cash-induced changes in the purchasing power of money on deferred 
payments. But it is entirely wrong with regard to any kind of entre- 
preneurial profit or loss, whether they emerge in a stationary economy 
in which the total amount of profits equals the total amount of losses 
or in a progressing or a retrogressing economy in which these two 
magnitudes arc different.

distress, but the fact that healleviates or entirely removes what causes 
his fellow citizen's feeling of uneasiness. What hurts the sick is the 
plague, not the physician who treats the disease. The doctor's gain 
is not an outcome of the epidemics, but of the aid he gives to those 
affected. The ultimate source of profits is always the foresight of 
future conditions. Those who succeeded better than others in antici-

pating future events and in adjusting their activities to the future state 
of the market, reap profits because they are in a position to satisfy the 
most urgent needs of the public. The profits of those who have pro- 
duced goods and services for which the buyers scramble are not the 
source of the losses of those who have brought to the market com- 
modities in the purchase of which the public is not prepared to pay 
the full amount of production costs expended. These losses are caused 
by the lack of insight displayed in anticipating the future demand 
of the consumers. 

External events affecting demand and supply may sometimes come 
so suddenly and unexpectedly that people say that no reasonable man 
could have foreseen them. Then the envious may consider the profits 
of those who gain from the change as unjustified. Yet such arbitrary 
value judgments do not alter the real state of interests. It is certain$ 
better for a sick man to be cured by a doctor for a high fee than to 
lack medical assistance. If it were otherwise, he would not consult the 
physician. 

There are in the market economy no conflicts between the interests 
of the buyers and sellers. There are disadvantages caused by inade- 
quate foresight. It would be a universal boon if every ma; and all 
the members of the market society would always foresee future condi- 
tions correctly and in time and act accordingly. If this were the case, 
retrospection would establish that no particle of capital and labor 
was wasted for the satisfaction of wants which now are considered 
as less urgent than some other unsatisfied wants. However, man is 
not omniscient. 

It is wrong to look at these problems from the point of view of 
resentment and envy. It is no less faulty to restrict one's observation 
to the momentary position of various individuals. These are social 
problems and must be judged with regard to the operation of the 
whole market system. What secures the best possible satisfaction of 
the demands of each member of society is precisely the fact that those 
who succeeded better than other people in anticipating future condi- 
tions are earning profits. If profits were to be curtailed for the benefit 
of those whom a change in the data has injured, the adjustment of 
supply to demand would not be improved but impaired. If one were 
to prevent doctors from occasionally earning high fees, one would not 
increase but rather decrease the number of those choosing the medical 
profession. 

The deaI is always advantageous both for the buyer and the seller. 
Even a man who sells at a Ioss is still better off than he would be if 
he could not sell at all, or only at a still lower price. He loses on account

of his lack of foresight; the sale limits his loss even if rhe price re- 
ceived is low. If both the buyer and the seller were not to consider the 
transaction as the most advantageous action they could choose under 
the prevailing conditions, they would not enter into the deal. 

The statement that one man's boon is the other man's damage is 
valid with regard to robbery, war, and booty. The robber's plunder 
is the damage of the despoiled victim. But war and commerce are 
two different things. Voltaire erred whcn-in I 76+--hc wrote in the 
article "Patrie" of his Dictionmire philosophique: "To be a good 
patriot is to wish that onc's own community should enrich itself by 
trade and acquire power by arms; it is obvious that a country cannot 
profit but at the cxpense of another and that it cannot conquer with- 
out inflicting harm on other people." Voltaire, like so many other 
authors who preceded and followed him, deemed it superfluous to 
familiarize himself with economic thought. If he had read the essays 
of his contemporary David Ilume, he would have learned how false 
it: is to idcntify war and foreign trade. VoItaire, the great debunker 
of age-o!d superstitions and popular fallacics, fell prey unawares to 
the most disastrous fallacy. 

When the baker provides the dentist with bread and the dcntist 
relieves rhe baker's toothache, neither the baker nor the dentist is 
harmed. It is wrong to consider such an exchange of services and 
the pillage of the baker's shop by armed gangsters as two manifesta- 
tions of the same thing. Foreign trade differs from domestic trade 
only in so far as goods and services are exchanged beyond the border- 
lines separating the territories of two sovereign nations. It is mon- 
strous that l'rince Louis Kapoleon Bonaparte, the later Ernperor 
Napoleon 111, should have writtcn many decades after Hume, Adam 
Smith, and Ricardo: "The quantity of merchandise which a country 
exports is always in direct proportion to the number of shells it can 
discharge upon its enemics whenever its honor and its dignity may 
require it." 'All the teachings of economics concerning the effects 
of the international division of labor and of international trade have 
up to now failed to destroy the popularity of the Mercantilist fallacy, 

"that the object of forcign trade is to pauperize foreigners." It is 
a task of historical investigation to disclose the sources of the popu- 
larity of this and other similar delusions and errors. For economics 
the matter is long since settled.

2. The Limitation of Offspring 
The natural scarcity of the means of sustenance forces every living 
being to look upon all other living beings as deadly foes in the struggle 
for survival, and generates pitiless biological competition. Rut with 
Inan these irreconcilable conflicts of interests disappear when, and 
as far as, the division of labor is substituted for economic autarky of 
individuals, families, tribes, and nations. Within the system of society 
there is no conflict of interests as long as the optimum size of popula- 
tion has not been reached. As long as the employment of additional 
hands resuIts in a more than proportionate increase in the returns, 
harmony of interests is substituted for conflict. People are no longer 
rivals in the struggle for the allocation of portions out of a strictly 
limited supply. They become cooperators in striving after ends com- 
mon to all of them. An increase in population figures does not curtail, 
but rather augments, the average shares of the individuals. 

If men were to strive only after nourishment and sexuaI satisfaction, 
population wo~lld tend to increase beyond the optimum size to the 
limits drawn by the sustenance available. However, men want more 
than merely to live and to copulate; they want to live humanly. An 
improvement in conditions usually results, it is true, in an increase 
in population figures; but this increase lags bchind the increase in 
bare sustenance. If it were otherwise, men would have never suc- 
ceeded in the establishment of social bonds and in the development of 
civilization. As with rats, mice, and microbes, every increase in sus- 
tenance would have made population figures rise to the limits of 
bare sustenance; nothing would have been left for the seeking of 
other ends. The fundamental error implied in the iron law of wages 
was precisely the fact that it looked upon men-or at least upon the 
wage earners-as beings exclusively driven by animal impulses. Its 
champions failed to rcalize that man differs from the beasts as far as 
he aims aiso at specificaiiy human ends, whlch one may call higher 
or more sublime ends. 

The Malthusian law of population is one of the great achievements 
of thought. Together with the principle of the division of labor it 
provided the foundations for modern biology and for the theory of 
evolution; the importance of these two fundamental theorems for 
the sciences of human action is second only to the discovery of the 
regularity in the intertwinement and sequence of market phenomena 
and their inevitable determination by the market data. The objections 
raised against the Malthusian law as well as against the law of returns 


Human Action 

are vain and trivial. Both laws are indisputable. But the role to be 
assigned to them within the body of the sciences of human action 
is different from that which Malthus attributed to them. 

Nonhuman beings are entirely subject to the operation of the bio- 
logical law described by Malthus.' For them the statement that their 
numbers tend to encroach upon the means of subsistence and that 
the supernumerary specimens arc weeded out by want of sustenance 
is valid without any exception. With reference to the nonhuman 
animals the notion of minimum sustenance has an unequivocal, 
uniquely determined sense. But the case is different with man. Man 
integrates the satisfaction of the purely zoological impulses, common 
to all animals, into a scale of values, in which a place is also assigned to 
specifically human ends. Acting man also rationalizes the satisfaction 
of his sexual appetites. Their satisfaction is the outcome of a weighing 
of pros and cons. Man does not blindIy submit to a sexual stimulation 
like a bulI; he refrains from copulation if he deems the costs-the 
anticipated disadvantages-too high. In this sense we may, without 
any valuation or ethical connotation, apply the term 7~70ral restraint 
employed by Rilalth~s.~ 

Rationalization of sexual intercourse already involves the rationali- 
zation of proliferation. Then later further methods of rationalizing 
the increase of progeny were adopted which were independent of 
abstention from copulatiol~. People resorted to the egregious and re- 
pulsive practices of exposing or killing infants and of abortion. Finally 
they learned to perform the sexual act in such a way that no pregnancy 
resblts. In the last hundred years the technique of contraccptivc 
devices has been perfected and the frequency of their employment 
increased considerably. Yet the procedures had long been ltnown 
and practiced. 

The wealth that modern capitalism bestows upon the broad masses 

of the capitalist countries and the improvement in hygienic condi- 

tions and therapeutical and prophylactic methods brought about by 

capitalism have considerably reduced mortality, especially infant 

mortality, and prolonged the average duration of life. Today in these 

countries the restriction in generating offspring can succeed only if 

4. The Malthusian law is, of course, a biological and not a praxeological law. 
I-Iowever, its cognizance is indispensable for praxeology in order to conceive by 
contrast the essential characteristic of human action. As the natural sciences 
failed to discover it, the economists had to fill the gap. The history of the law of 
populatiori too explodes the popular myth about the backwardness of the sciences 
of human action and their need to borrow from the natural sciences. 
5. MaIthus too employed this term without any valuational or ethical implica- 
tion. Cf. Ronar, Malthw and His Work (London, 1885), p. 53. One could as well 
substitute the term praxeological restraint for moral restraint. 

Harmony and Conflict of Interests 

it is more drastic than in earlicr ages. The transition to capitalism-i.e., 
the removal of the obstacles which in former days had fettered the 
functioning of private initiative and enterprise-has consequently 
deeply influenced sexual customs. It is not the practice of birth controI 
that is new, but merely the fact that it is more frequently resorted to. 
Especially new is the fact that the practice is no longer limited to the 
upper strata of the population, but is common to the whole popula- 
tion. For it is onc of the most important social effects of capitalism 
that it deproletarianizes all strata of society. It raises the standard of 
living of the masses of the manual workers to such a height that they 
too turn into "bourgeois" and think and act like well-to-do burghers. 
Eager to preserve their standard of living for themselves and for their 
children, they embark upon birth control. With the spread and 
progress of capitalism, birth control becomes a universal practice. 
The transition to capitalism is thus accompanied by two phenomena: 
a decline both in fertility rates and in mortality rates. The average 
duration of life is prolonged. 

In the days of Malthus it was not yet possible to observe these 
demographical characteristics of capitalism. Today it is no longer 
permissible to question them. But: blinded by romantic prepossessions, 
many describe them as phenomena of decline and degeneration pecul- 
iar only to the white-skinned peoples of Western civilization, grown 
old and decrepit. These romantics are seriously alarmed by the fact 
that the Asiatics do not practice birth controf to the same extent to 
which it is practiced in Western Europe, North America, and 
Australia. As modern methods of fighting and preventing disease have 
brought about a drop in mortality rates with these oriental peoples 
too, their population figures grow more rapidly than those of the 
Western nations. Will not the indigencs of India, Malaya, China, and 
Japan, who themselves did not contribute to the technological and 
therapeutical achievements of the West, but received them as an un- 
expected present, in the end by the sheer superiority of their numbers 
squeeze out the peoples of European descent? 

These fears are groundless. Historical esperiencc shows that all 
Caucasian peoples reacted to the drop in mortality figures brought 
about by capitalism with a drop in the birth rate. Of course, from 
such historical experience no general law may bc deduced. Bat 
praxeologicaf reflection demonstrates that there exists between these 
two phenomena a necessary concatenation. An improvement in the 
external conditions of we1l:being makes possible a corresponding in- 
crease in population figures. However, if the additional quantity of 
the means of sustenance is completely absorbed by rearing an addi- 


Human Actzon 

tional number of people, nothing is left for a further improvement 
in the btandard of living. The march of civilization is arrested; man- 
kind rcaches a state of stagnation. 

?'he case bccomes still more obvious if we assurnc that a prophylac- 
tic invcntion is made by a lucky chancc and that its practical applica- 
tion requires neither a considerable investment of capital nor consider- 
able current expenditure. Of course, modern medical rescarch and 
still more its utilization absorb huge amounts of capital and labor. 
Thcy are product5 of capitalism. They would nevcr have come into 
cxistcncc in a noncapitalist environment. But there were, in earlier 
days, instances of a different character. The practice of smallpox 
inoculation did not originate from expensive laboratory rcscarch 
and, in its original crude form, could be applied at trifling costs. Sow, 
what would the rcsults of smallpox inoculation have bcen if its prac- 
tice had become gcneral in a prccapitalist country not comn.litted 
to birth control? It would have increascd population figures without 
incrcasing sustenance, it would have impaircd the average standard 
of living. It would not have been a blessing, but a cursc. 

Conditions in Asia and Africa are, by and large, thc samc. These 
backward peoples receivc the devices for fighting and preventing 
disease ready-madc from thc West. Often they are not even charged 
for the drugs, the hospital cquipment, and theservices of the doctors. 
The Whitcs defray thc costs, sometimes out of humanitarian con- 
siderations, somcti&es iinpclled by thcir own intcrcsts. It is true that 
in some of thcse countries imported forcign capital and the adoption 
of foreign technological methods by the comparatively sn~all dorncstic 
capital synchronously tend to increase the per capita output of labor 
and thus to bring about a tendency toward an improvenlent in the 
average standard of living. However, this does not suficiently 
counterbalancc the opposite tendency resulting from the drop in 
mortality rates not accompanied by an adequate fall in fertility rates. 
The contact with the West has not yet benefited thcse peoples be- 
cause it has not yet affected thcir minds; it has not freed them from 
age-old superstitions, prejudices, and misapprehensions; it has rnerely 
altcred their technological and therapcutical knowledge. 

The reformers of the oriental pcoplcs want to secure for thcir 
fcllow citizens the matcrial well-being that the Western nations enjoy. 
Deluded by Marxian, nationalist, and militarist ideas they think that 
all that is ;ceded for the attainment of this end is the introduction 
of European and American tcchnology. Ncither thc Slavonic Bol- 
sheviks and nationalists nor their sympathizers in the Indies, in China, 
and in Japan realize that what their peoples need most is not Western 


Flu~wzonyand Conflict of Interests 

technolog?-, but the social order which in addition to other achieve- 
ments has generated this technological knowledge. They lack first 
of all economic freedom and private initiative, entrepreneurs and 
capitalism. But they look only for engineers and machines. What 
separates East and West is the social and economic system. The East 
is foreign to the Western spirit that has created capitalism. It is of 
no use to import the paraphernalia of capitalism without admitting 
capitalism as such. T\To achievement of capitalist civilization would 
have been accon~plished in a noncapitalistic environment or can be 
preserved in a world withottt a market economy. 

If the Asiatics really enter into the orbit of Western civiIization, 
they will have to adopt the market economy without reservations. 
Then their masses will rise above their present proletarian wretched- 
ness and practice birth control as it is practiced in every capitalistic 
country. No excessive growth of population wilI longer hinder the 
improvement in the standards of living. But if the oriental peoples 
in the future confine themselves to mechanical reception of the 
tangible achievements of the West without embracing its basic 
philosophy and social ideologies, they will forever remain in their 
present state of inferiority and destitution. Their populations may 
increase considerably, but they will not raise themselves above dis- 
tress. These miserable masses of paupers will certainly not be a serious 
menace to the independence of the Western nations. As long as there 
is a need for weapons, the entrepreneurs of the market society will 
never stop producing more efficient weapons and thus securing to 
their countrymen a superiority of equipment over the merely imita- 
tive noncapitalistic Orientals. The military events of both World 
Wars have proved anew that the capitalistic countries arc paramount 
also in armaments production. No foreign aggressor can destroy 
capitalist civilization if it does not destroy itself. Where capitalistic 
entrepreneurship is allowed to function freely, the fighting forces 
will always be so well equipped that the biggest armies of the back- 
ward peoples will be no match for them. There has even been great 
exaggeration of the danger of making the forn~ulas for manufacturing 
<Isecret" weapons universally known. If war comes again, the search- 
ing mind of the capitalistic world will always have a head start on 
the peoples who merely copy and imitate clumsily. 

The peoples who have developed the system of market economy 
arid cling to it arc in every respect superior to all other peoples. The 
fact that they are eager to preserve peace is not a mark of their weak- 
ness and inability to wage war. They love peace because they know 
that armed conflicts are pernicious and disintegrate the social division 


Human Action 

of labor. But if war becomes unavoidable, they show their superior 
efficiency in military affairs too. Thcy repel the barbarian aggressors 
whatcve; their numbers may be. 

The purposive adjustment of the birth rate to the supply of the 
material potentialities of well-being is an indispensable condition of 
human life and action, of civilization, and of any improvement in 
wealth and welfare. Whether the only beneficial method of birth 
control is abstention from coitus is a question which must be decided 
from the point of view of bodily and mental hygiene. It is absurd to 
confuse the issue by referring to ethical precepts developed in ages 
which were faced with different conditions. However, praxeology 
is not interested in the theological aspects of the problem. It has merely 
to establish the fact that where there is no limitation of offspring 
there cannot be any question of civilization and improvement in the 
standard of living. 

A socialist commonwealth would be under the necessity of regulat- 
ing the fertility rate by authoritarian control. It would have to regi- 
ment the sexual life of its wards no less than all other spheres of their 
conduct. In the market economy every individual is spontaneously 
intent upon not begetting children whom he could not rear without 
considerably lowering his family's standard of life. Thus the growth 
of population t)eyond the optimum size as determined by the supply 
of capital available and the state of technological knowledge is 
checked. The interests of each individual coincide with those of all 
other individuals. 

Those fighting birth control want to eliniinate a device indis- 
pensable for the preservation of peaceful human cooperation and 
the socia1 division of labor. Where the average standard of living is 
impaired by the excessive increase in population figures, irreconcilable 
conflicts of interests arise. Each individual is again a rival of all other 
individuals in the struggle for survival. The annihilation of rivals is 
the only mans of increasing one's own well-being. Thc philosophers 
and theologians who assert that birth control is contrary to the laws of 
God and Nature refuse to see things as they really are. Nature straitens 
the material means required for the improvement of human well- 
being and survival. As natural conditions are, man has only the choice 
betsvccn the pitiless war of each against each or social cooperation. 
But social cooperation is impossible if peopIe give rein to the natural 
impulse of proliferation. In restricting procreation man adjusts him- 
self to the natural conditions of his existence. The rationalization of 
the sexual passions is an indispensable condition of civilization and 
societal bonds. Its abandonment would in the long run not increase 


Harmony and Conflict of Interests 

but decrease the numbers of those surviving, and would render life 
for everyone as poor and miserable as it was many thousands of years 
ago for our ancestors. 

3. The Harmony of the "Rightly Understood" Interests 
From time immemorial men have prattled about the blissful condi- 
tions their ancestors enjoyed in the original "state of nature." From old 
myths, fabies, and poems the image of this primitive happiness passed 
into many popular philosophies of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. In their language the term natural denoted what was good 
and beneficial in human affairs, while the term civilization had the 
connotationof opprobrium. The fall of man was seen in the deviation 
from the primitive conditions of ages in which there was but little 
difference between man and other animals. At that time, these ro- 
mantic eulogists of the past asserted, there were no conflicts between 
men. Peace was undisturbed in the Garden of Eden. 

Yet nature does not generate peace and good will. The characteris- 
tic mark of the "state of nature" is irreconcilable conflict. Each 
specimen is the rival of all other specimens. The means of subsistence 
are scarce and do not grant survival to all. The conflicts can never 
disappear. If a band of men, united with the object of defeating rival 
bands, succeeds in annihilating its foes, new antagonisms arise among 
the victors over the distribution of the booty. The source of the 
conflicts is always thc fact that each man's portion curtails the portions 
of all other men. This is a dilemma that does not allow of any peaceful 
solution. 

What makes friendly relations between human beings possible is 
the higher productivity of the division of labor. It removes the natural 
conflict of interests. For where there is division of labor, therc is 
no longer question of the distribution of a supply not capable of en- 
largement. Thanks to thc higher productivity of labor performed 
under the division of tasks, the supply of goods multiplies. A pre-
eminent common interest, the preservation and further intensifica- 
tion of social cooperation, becomes paramount and obliterates all 
essential collisions. Catallactic competition is substituted for biolog- 
ical competition. It makes for harmony of the interests of all 
members of society. The very condition from which the irreconcilable 
conflicts of biological competition arise-viz., the fact that all people 
by and large strive after the same things-is transformed into a factor 
making for harmony of interests. Because many people or even all 
people want bread, clothes, shoes, and cars, large-scale production 


Human Action 

of these goods becomes fcasible and reduces the costs of production 
to such an cxtent that they are accessible at low prices. The fact that 
my fellow man wants to acquire shoes as I do, does not make it harder 
for me to get shoes, but easier. What enhances the price of shoes 
is the fact that nature does not provide a more ample supply of leather 
and other raw materials required, and that one must submit to the 
disutility of labor in order to transform thesc raw materials into shoes. 
The catallactic competition of those who, like me, are eager to have 
shoes makes shoes cheaper, not more expensive. 

This is the meaning of the theorem of the harmony of the rightly 
understood interests of all members of the market so~iety.~ 

When 
the classical economists made this statement, they werc trying to 
stress two points: First, that everybody is interested in the preserva- 
tion of the social division of labor, the systern that multiplies the 
productivity of human efforts. Second, that in the market society 
consumers' demand ultimately directs all production activities. The 
fact that not all human wants can be satisfied is not due to inap- 
propriate social institutions or to deficiencies of the system of the 
market economy. It is a natural condition of human life. The belief 
that nature bestows upon man inexhaustible riches and that misery 
is an outgrowth of man's failure to organizc the good society is cn- 
tirely fallacious. The "state of nature" which the reformers and 
utopians dcpicted as paradisiac was in fact a state of extreme poverty 
and distress. "Poverty," says Bentham, "is not the work of the laws, 
it is the primitive condition of the human race." Even those at the 
base of the social pyramid arc much better off than they would have 
been in the absence of social cooperation. They too arc benefited by 
the operation of the market economy and participate in the ad- 
vantages of civilized society. 

The nineteenth-century rcformers did not drop thc cherishcd fable 

of the originaI earthly paradise. Frederick Engels incorporated it in 

the Marxian account of mankind's social evolution. Ilowever, they 

no ionger set up the bliss of the aurea aetas as a pattern for sociai and 

economic reconstruction. They contrast the alleged depravity of 

capitalism with the ideal happiness man will enjoy in the socialist 

Elysium of the future. The socialist mode of produ&on will abolish 

the fetters by means of which capitalism checks the development of 

the productive forces, and will increase the productivity of labor 

and wealth beyond all measure. The prcservation of free enterprise

run."

Harmony and Conflict of interests 

and the private oumership of the means of production benefits ex- 
clusively the small minority of parasitic cxploitcrs and harms the 
immense majority of working men. Hence there prevails within the 
frame of the market society an irreconcilable conflict between the 
interests of "capital" and thosc of "labor." This class struggle can dis- 
appear only when a fair system of social organization-either socialism 
or interventionism-is substituted for the manifestly unfair capitalist 
mode of production. 

Such is the alrnost universally accepted social philosophy of our 
age. It was not created by Marx, although it owes its popularity 
mainly to the writings of Marx and the Ailarxians. It is today endorsed 
not only by the Marxians, but no less by most of those parties who 
emphatically declare their anti-Marxism and pay lip service to free 
enterprise. It is the official social philosophy of Roman CathoIicism 
as well as of Anglo-Catholicism; it is supported by many eminent 
champions of the various Protestant denominations and of the Ortho- 
dox Oriental Church. It is an essential part of the teachings of Italian 
Fascism and of German Nazism and of all varieties of interventionist 
doctrines. It was the ideology of the Sozialpolitik of the Hohcnzol- 
lerns in Germany and the French royalists aiming at the restoration of 
the house of Bourbon-OrlCans, of the New Ileal of President Roose- 
velt, and of the nationalists of Asia and Latin America. The antago- 
nisms between these parties and factions refer to accidental issues- 
such as religious dogma, constitutional institutions, foreign policy- 
and, first of all, to the characteristic features of the social system that 
is to be substituted for capitalism. But they all agree in the funda- 
mental thesis that the very existence of the capitalist system harms the 
vital interests of the immense majority of workers, artisans, and small 
farmers, and they all ask in the name of social justice for the abolition 
of ~apitalism.~ 

8. The officiaI doctrine of the Roman Church is outlined in the encyclical 
Quadragesirno anno of Pope Pius XI (1931). The Anglo-Catholic doctrine is 
presented by the late William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the book 
Christianity and the Social Order (Penguin Special, 1942). Representative of the 
ideas of European continental Protestantism is the book of Elnil Brunner, Justice 
and the Social Order, trans. by M. Hottingcr (New York, 1945). A highly signif- 
icant document is the section on "The Church 2nd Disorder of Society" of the 
draft report which the World Council of Churches in September, 1948 recom- 
mended for appropriate action to the one hundred and fifty odd denominations 
whose delegates are members of the Council. For the ideas of Nicolas Berdyaew, 
the most eminent apologist of Russian Orthodoxy, cf. his book The Origin of 
Russian Co7nmnim (London, 1937)~ especially pp. 217-2 18 and 225. It is often 
asserted that an essential differencc between the Marxians and the other socialist 
and interventionist parties is to be found in the fact that the Marxians stand for 
class struggle, while the latter parties look at the class struggle as upon a deplor-
able outgrowth of the irreconcilable conflict of class interests inherent in capital- 

Human Action 

All socialist and interventionist authors and politicians base their 
analysis and critique of the market economy on two fundamentaI 
errors. First, they fail to recognize the speculative character inherent 
in all endeavors to provide for future want-satisfaction, i.e., in all 
human action. They na'ively assume that there cannot exist any doubt 
about the measures to be applied for the best possible provisioning 
of the consumers. In a socialist commonwealth there will be no need 
for the production tsar (or the central board of production manage- 
ment) to speculate. He will "simply" have to resort to those measures 
which are beneficial to his wards. The advocates of a planned econ- 
omy have never conceived that the task is to provide for future wants 
which may differ from today's wants and to employ the various avail- 
abIe factors of production in the most expedient way for the best 
possible satisfaction of these uncertain future wants. They have not 
conceived that the problem is to allocate scarce factors of ;reduction 
to the various branches of production in such a way that no wants 
considered more urgent should remain unsatisfied because the factors 
of production required for their satisfaction were employed, ix., 
wasted, for the satisfaction of wants considered less urgent. This 
economic problem must not be confused with the technological 
protdem. TechnologicaI knowledge can merely tell us what could 
be achieved under the present state of our scientific insight. It does not 
answer the questions as to what should be produced and in what quan- 
tities, and which of the 'muItitude of technological processes available 
should be chosen. Deluded by their failure to grasp this essential 
matter, the advocates of a planned society believe that the production 
tsar will never err in his decisions. In the market econon~y the entre- 
preneurs and capitalists cannot avoid committing serious blunders 
hecause they know neither what the consumers want nor what their 
competitors are doing. The general n~anager of a socialist state will be 
infallible because he alone wilI have the power to determine what 
should be produced and how, and because no action of other people 
wl!! cress his p!ans." 

The second fundamental error involved in the socialists1 critique 
of the market economy stems from their faulty theory of wages. 

ism and want to overcome it by the realization of the reforms they recommend. 
However, the Marxians do not praise and kindle the class struggle fur its own 
sake. In their eyes the class struggle is good only because it is the device by means 
of which the "productive forces," those mysterious forces directing rhe course 
of human evolution, are bound to bring about the "classless" society in which 
there will be neither classes nor class conflicts. 

9. The thorough exposure of this delusion is provided by thc proof of the im- 
possibility of economic calculation under socialism. See below the fifth part of 
this book. 

Harmony and Conpict of Inte~ests 673 

They have failed to realize that wages are the price paid for the wagc 
earner's achicvcment, i.e., for the contribution of his efforts to the 
processing of the good conccrned or, as people say, for the value 
which his services add to the value of the materials. No matter whether 
thcre are time wages or piece work wages, the employer always buys 
the worker's performance and services, not his time. It is therefore 
not true that in the unhampered market economy the worker has 
no personal interest in thc execution of his task. The socialists are 
badly mistaken in assertiilg that those paid a certain rate per hour, 
per day, per week, per month, or per year are not impelled by thcir 
own selfish interests when they work efficiently. It is not lofty ideals 
and the sense of duty that deter a worker paid according to the length 
of time worked from carclcssness and loafing around the shop, but 
vcry substantial arguments. He who works more and bettcr gets higher 
pay, and he who wants to earn more must increase the quantity and 
improve the quality of his pcrformance. The hard-boiled enlployers 
arc not so gullible as to let themselves be cheated by slothful em- 
ployees; they are not so negligent as those governments who pap 
salaries to hosts of loafing bureaucrats. Neither arc the wage earners 

so stupid as not to know that laziness and incfticicncy are heavily 
penalized on the labor markct.1° 

On the shaky ground of thcir misconception of the catallactic nature 
of wages, the socialist authors havc advanced fantastic fablcs about the 
increase in thc productivity of labor to bc expected from the realiza- 
tion of their plans. Under capitalism, thcy say, the worker's zeal is 
seriously impaired because he is aware of the fact that he himself 
does not rcap the fruits of his labor and that his toil and trouble enrich 
merely his employer, this parasitic and idle exploiter. nut under 
socialism every worker will know that he works for the benefit of 
society, of which he himself is a part. This knowledge will provide 
him Gith the most powerful incentive to do his best. An enormous 
increase in the productivity of labor and thereby in wealth will result. 

However, the idcntification of the interests of each worker and 
those of the socialist commonwealth is a purely leplistic and formal- 
istic fiction which has nothing to do with the real state of affairs. JVhile 
the sacrifices an individual worker makes in intensifying his own exer- 
tion burdcn him alone, only an infinitesimal fraction of the produce 
of his additional exertion benefits himself and improves his own well- 
being. While thc individual worl~er enjoys completely the pleasures 
he may reap by yielding to the temptation to carclessness and ladness, 
the resulting impairment of thc social dividend curtails his own sharc 

10. Cf. above, pp. 598430. 

Human Action 

only infinitesimally. Under such a socialist mode of production all 
personal incentives which selfishness provides under capitalism are 
removed, and a premium is put upon laziness and negligence. Whereas 
in a capitalist society sclfishness incites everyone to the utmost dili- 
gence, in a socialist society it makes for inertia and laxity. The socialists 
may still babble about the miraculous change in human nature that 
the advent of socialism will effect, and about the substitution of lofty 
altruism for mean egotism. But they must no longer indulge in fables 
about the marvelous effects the selfishness of each individual will 
bring about under socialism.ll 

90 judicious man can fail to conclude from the evidence of these 
considerations that in the market economy the productivity of labor 
is incomparably higher than it would be under socialisn~. However, 
this cognition does not settle the question between the advocates of 
capitalism and those of socialism from a praxeological, i.e., scientific, 
point of view. 

A bona fide advocate of socialism who is free from bigotry, pre- 
possession, and malice could still contend: "It may bc true that P, the 
total net income turned out in a market society, is larger than p, the 
total net income turned out in a socialist society. But if the socialist 

system assigns to each of its members an equal share of p (vis,? =d), 

Z 

all those whose income in the market society is smaller than d are 
favored by the substitution of socialism for capitalism. It may happen 
that this group of people includes the majority of men. At any rate it 
becomes evident that the doctrine of the harmony between the rightly 
understood interests of all members of the market society is untenable. 
There is a class of men whose interests are hurt by the very existence 
of the market economy and who would be better off under socialism." 
The liberals contest the conclusiveness of this reasoning. They believe 
that p will lag so much behind P that d will be smallcr than the income 
which even those earning the lowest wagcs get in the markct society. 
There can be nc d~ub::ha: the ol-,)ec:ion raised by the liberals is 
well founded. However, their refutation of the socialist claims is not 
based on praxeological considerations and therefore lacks the apodic- 
tic and incontestable argumentative power inherent in a praxeological 

I I. The doctrine refuted in the text found its most brilliant expositor in John 
Stuart Mill (Principles of Political Economy [People's ed. London, 18671, pp. 
I 26 ff.). However, Mill resorted to this doctrine merely in order to refute an 
objection raised against socialism, viz., that, by eliminating the incentive provided 
by selfishness, it would impair the productivity of labor. He was not so blind as 
to assert that the productivity of labor would multiply under socialism. For an 
analysis and refutation of Mill's reasoning, cf. Mises, Socialism, pp. 173-181. 

Harmony and Conffict of Interests 675 

demonstration. It is based on a judgment of relevance, the quantita- 
tive appraisal of the difference between the two magnitudes P and P. 
In the field of human action such quantitative cognition is obtained 
by understanding, with regard to which full agreerncnt between men 
cannot be reached. Praxeology, economics, and catallactics are of 
no use for the settlement of such dissensions concerning quantitative 
issues. 

The advocates of socialism could even go farther and say: "Granted 
that each individual will be worse off under socialism than even the 
poorest under capitalism. Yet we spurn the market economy in spite 
of the fact that it supplies everybody with more goods than socialism. 
We disapprove of capitalism on ethical grounds as an unfair and 
amoral system. We prefer socialism on grounds commonly called non- 
economic and pur up with the fact that it impairs cvcrybody's material 
well-being."12 It cannot be denied that this haughty indifference 
with regard to material wcll-being is a privilege reserved to ivory- 
tower intellectuals, secluded from reality, and to ascetic anchorites. 
What made socialism popular with the immense majority of its sup- 
porters was, on the contrary-, the illusion that it would supply them 
with more amenities than capitalism. But however this may be, it is 
obvious that this type of prosocialist argumentation cannot be touched 
by the liberal reasoning concerning the productivity of labor. 

If no other objections could be raised to the socialist plans than 
that socialism will lower the standard of living of all or at least of 
the immensc majority, it would be impossible for praxeology to pro- 
nounce a final judgment. Men would have to decide the issue betwecn 
capitalism and socialism on the ground of judgments of value and of 
judgments of relevance. They would have to choose between the 
two systems as they choose between many other things. Xo objective 
standard could be discovered which would make it possible to settle 
the dispute in a manner which allows no contradiction and must be 
accepted by every sane individual. The freedom of each man's choice 
and discretion would not be annihilated by inexorable necessity. 
Ilowever, the true state of affairs is entirely different. Man is not in 
a position to choose between these two systems. Human cooperation 
under the system of the social division of labor is possible only in the 

12. This mode of reasoning was ~nainly resorted to by many eminent cham- 
pions of Christian socialism. The ~Marxians used to recommend socialism on the 
ground that it would multiply productivity and bring unprecedented material 
wealrh to everybody. Only lately have they changed their tactics. They declare 
that rhe Russian worker is happier than the American worker in spite of the fact 
that his standard of living is much lower; the knowledge that he lives under a 
fair social system compensates by far for all his material hardships.

market cconorny. Socialism is not a realizable system of society's 
econonlic organization becausc it lacks any method of economic cal- 
culation. To deal with this fundamental problem is the task of the 
fifth part of this book. 

The establishment of this truth does not amount to a deprcciation 
of the conclusiveness and the convincing power of the antisocialist 
argument derived from thc impairment of productivity to be expected 
from socialism. The weight of this objection raised to the socialist 
plans is so overwhelming that no judicious man could hesitate to 
choose capitalism. Yet this would still be a choicc between alternative 
systems of society's econon~ic organization, prcference given to one 
system as against another. Howcver, such is not the alternative. Social- 
ism cannot he realized becausc it is beyond human power to establish 
it as a social system. The choice is between capitalism and chaos. A 
man who chooses betwecn drinking a glass of milk and a glass of a 
solution of potassium cyanide does not choosc between two beverages; 
he chooses between life and death. A society that chooses betwecn 
capitalism and socialism does not choosc betwecn two social systems; it 
chooses between social cooperation and the disintegration of society. 
Socialism is not an alternativc to capitalism; it is an alternativc to any 
system under which men can live as lxw~anbeings. To strcss this point 
is the task of economics as it is the task of biology and chemistry to 
teach that potassium cyanide is not a nutriment but a deadly poison. 

The convincing power of the productivity argument is in fact so 
irresistible that the advocates of socialisnl were forced to abandon 
their oId tactics and to resort to new methods. They are eager to 
divert attention from the productivity issue by throwing into relief 
the monopoly problem. All contemporary socialist manifestoes ex- 
patiate on monopoly power. Statesmen and professors try to outdo 
one another in depicting the evils of monopoly. Our age is called the 
age of monopoly capitalism. The foremost argument advanced today 
in favor of socialism is the refcrcnce to monopoly. 

Xow, it is true that the emcrgence of monopoly priccs (not of 

monopoly as such without monopoly prices) creates a discrepancy 

bctwccn the interests of thc monopolist and thosc of the consumers. 

The monopolist does not employ the monopolized good according 

to thc wishes of the consumers. As far as there arc monopoly prices, 

the interests of the monopolist takc precedence over those of the 

public and the democracy of the market is restricted. With regard to 

monopoly prices there is not harmony, but conflict of intercsts. 

It is possible to contest these statcmcnts with regard to the monopoly 

prices received in the sale of articles under patents and copyrights. 


Harmony and Conflict of Interests 

One may argue that in the absence of patent and copyright legislation 
these books, compositions, and technological innovations would never 
have comc into existence. The public pays monopoly prices for things 
they would not have enjoyed at all under competitive prices. How- 
ever, we may fairly disregard this issue. It has little to do with the 
great monopoly controversy of our day. When peoplc deal with 
the evils of &;lopo~y, they imply that there prevails within the un-
hampered market economy a general and inevitable tendency toward 
the substitution of monopoly prices for competitive prices. This is, 
they say, a characteristic mark of "mature" or "late" capitalism. What- 
ever conditions may have been in thc earlier stages of capitalist cvolu- 
tion and whatever onc may think about the validity of the classical 
economists' statements conccrning the harmony of the rightly under- 
stood interests, today therc is no longer any question of such ;I 
harmony. 

As has been pointed out already,13 thcre is no such tendency toward 
rnonopolization. It is a fact that with many commodities in many 
countries monopoly prices prcvail, and, moreover, many articles are 
sold at monopoly prices on thc world market. However, almost all 
of these instances of monopoly prices are the outgrowth of govern- 
ment interference with business. Thcy were not created by thc inter- 
play of the factors operating on a free market. They are not products 
of capitalism, but precisely of the endeavors to countcract the forces 
determining the height of the market prices. Tt is a distortion of fact 
to speak of monopoly capitalism. It would be more appropriate to 
speak of monopoly interventionism or of monopoly statism. 

Those instances of monopoly prices which would appear also on 
a market not harnpercd and sabotaged by the interferencc of the 
vario~~s

national governments and by conspiracies between groups 
of governments are of minor imporrance. They concern some raw 
1nateriaIs the deposits of which are few and geographically concen- 
trated, and local limited-space monopolies. However, it is a fact that 
in these cases rnonopoly prices can bc realized even in the absence of 
government policies aiming directly or indirectly at their establish- 
ment. It is necessary to realizc that consumers' sovereignty is not per- 
fect and that there are limits to the operation of the democratic process 
of the market. There is, it is true, in some exceptionaI and rare cases 
of minor importance even on a market not hampered and sabotaged 
by government interference an antagonism between the interests of 
the owners of factors of production and those of the rest of the people. 
However, the existence of such antagonisms by no means impairs 

13. Cf. above, p. 363. 

Human Action 

the concord of the interests of a11 people with regard to the preserva- 
tion of the market economy. The market economy is the only system 
of society's economic organization that can function and really has 
been functioning. Socialism is unrealizable because of its inability 
to develop a method for economic calculation. Interventionism must 
result in a state of affairs which, from the point of view of its ad- 
vocates, is less desirable than the conditions of the unhampered market 
economy which it aims to alter. In addition, it liquidates itself as soon 
as it is pushed beyond a narrow field of application.li Such being the 
case, the only social order that can preserve and further intensify the 
social division of labor is the market economy. All those who do 
not wish to disintegrate social cooperation and to return to the 
conditions of primitive barbarism are interested in the perpetuation 
of the market economy. 

The classical economists' teachings concerning the harmony of the 
rightly understood interests were defective in so far as they failed 
to recognize the fact that the democratic process of the market is 
not perfect, because in some instances of minor importance, even in 
the unhampered market economy, nlonopoly prices may appear. But 
much more conspicuous was their failure to recognize that and why 
no socialist system can be considered as a system of society's economic 
organization. They based the doctrine of the harmony of interests 
upon the erroneous assumption that there are no exceptions to the 
rule that the owners of the means of production are forced by the 
market process to employ their property according to the wishes 
of the consumers. Today this theorem must be based on the knowledge 
that no economic calculation is feasible under socialism. 

4. Private Property 
Private ownership of the means of production is the fundamental 
institution of the market economy. It is the institution the presence of 
which characterizes the market econonly as such. Where it is absent, 
there is no question of a market economy. 

Ownership means fuIl control of the services that can be derived 
from a good. This catallactic notion of ownership and property rights 
is not to be confused with the legal definition of ownership and prop- 
erty rights as stated in the laws of various countries. It was the idea of 
legislators and courts to define the legal concept of property in such 
a way as to give to the proprietor full protection by the governmental 
apparatus of coercion and compulsion and to prevent anybody from 

14. Cf. ;he sixth part of this book. 

Harwiony and Conflict of Interests 

679 

encroaching upon his rights. As far as this purpose was adequately 
realized, the legal concept of property rights corresponded to the 
catallactic concept. However, nowadays there are tendencies to 
abolish the institution of private property by a change in the laws 
determining the scope of the actions which the proprietor is en- 
titled to undertake with regard to the things which are his property. 
While retaining the term private property, these reforrns aim at the 
substitution of public ownership for private ownership. This tendency 
is the characteristic mark of the plans of various schools of Christian 
socialism and of nationalist socialism. But few of the champions of 
these schools have been so keen as the R'azi philosopher Othmar Spann, 
who explicitly declared that the realization of his plans would bring 
about a state of affairs in which the institution of private property 
will be preserved only in a "formal scnse, while in fact there will be 
only public ownership." =There is need to mention thcse things in 
order to avoid popular fallacies and confusion. In dealing with private 
property, catallactics deals with control, not with IegaI terms, con- 
cepts and definitions. Private ownership means that the proprietors 
determine the employment of the factors of production, while public 
ownership means that the government controls their employment. 

Private property is a human device. It is not sacred. It came into 

existence in early ages of history, when people with their ow11 power 

and by their own authority appropriated to themselves what had 

previously not been anybody's propcrty. Again and again proprietors 

were robbed of their property by expropriation. The history of 

private property can be traced back to a point at which it origiiated 

out of acts which were certainly not legal. Virtually every owner is the 

direct or indirect legal successor of people who acquired ownership 

either by arbitrary appropriation of ownerless things or by violent 

spoliation of their predecessor. 

However, the fact that legal formalism can trace back every title 

either to arbitrary appropriation or to violent expropriation has no 

significance whatever for the conditions of a markct society. Owner- 

ship in the market economy is no longer linked up with the remote 

origin of private property. Those events in a far-distant past, hidden 

in the darkness of primitive mankind's history, are no longer of any 

concern for our day. For in an unhampered market society the con- 

sumers daily decide anew who should own and how much he should 

own. The consumers allot control of the means of production to 

those who know how to use them best for the satisfaction of the 

most urgent wants of the consumers. Only in a legal and formalistic 

15. Cf. Spann, Der wahre Staat (Leipzig, 1921), p. 249. 

Human Action 

sense can the owners be considered the successors of appropriators 
and expropriators. In fact, they are mandataries of the consumers, 
bound by the operation of the market to serve the consumers best. 
Capitalism is the consummation of the self-determination of the con- 
sumers. 

The meaning of private property in the market society is radically 
different from what it is under a system of each household's autarky. 
Where each househeld is economically seIf-sufficient, the privately 
owned means of production exclusively serve the proprietor. He 
alone reaps all the benefits derived from their employment. In the 
market society the proprietors of capital and land can enjoy their 
property only by employing it for the satisfaction of other people's 
wants. They must serve the consumers in order to have any advantage 
from what is their own. The very fact that they own means of 
production forces them to submit to the wishes of the public. Owner- 
ship is an asset only for those who know how to employ it in the best 
possible way for the benefit of the consumers. It is a social function. 

5. The Conflicts of Our Age 
Popular opinion sees the source of the conflicts which bring about 

the civil wars and international wars of our age in the collision of 

"economic" interests inherent in the market economy. Civil war 

is the rebellion of the "exploited" masses against the "exploiting" 

classes. Foreign war is the revolt of the "have-not" nations against 

those nations who have appropriated to themselves an unfair share 

of the earth's natural resources and, with insatiable greed, want to 

snatch even more of this wealth destined for the use of all. He who 

in face of these facts speaks of the harmony of the rightly understood 

interests, is either a moron or an infamous apologist of a manifestly 

unjust social order. No intelligent and honest man could fail to realize 

that there prevail today irreconcilable conflicts of material interests 

which can be settied oniy by recourse to arms. 

It is certainly true that our age is full of conflicts which generate 

war. However, these conflicts do not spring from the operation of 

the unhampered market society. It may be permissible to call them 

economic conflicts because they concern that sphere of human life 

which is, in common speech, known as the sphere of economic activi- 

ties. But it is a serious blunder to infer from this appellation that the 

source of these conflicts are conditions which develop within the 

frame of a market society. It is not capitalism that produces them, 

but precisely the anticapitalistic policies designed to check the func- 


Harnzony and Coriflict of Interests 68I 

tioning of capitalism. They are an outgrowth of the various govern- 
ments' interference with business, of trade and migration barriers 
and discrimination against foreign labor, forcign products, and 
foreign capital. 

None of these conflicts could have emerged in an unhampered 
rnarket economy. Imagine a world in which everybody were free 
to live and work as entrcpreneur or as employee where he wanted 
and how he chose, and ask which of these conflicts could still exist. 
Irnagine a world in which the principle of private ownership of the 
means of production is fully realized, in which there are no institu- 
tions hindering the mobility of capital, labor, and commodities. in 
which the laws, the courts, and thc adrninistrativc officers do not dih- 
criminate against any individual or group of individuals, whether 
native or alien. Imagine a state of affairs in which governments are 
devoted exclusively to thc task of protecting the individual's life, 
health, and property against violent and fraudulent aggression. In 
such a world the frontiers are drawn on the maps, but they do not 
hinder anybody from the pursuit of what he thinks wiI1 make him 
more prosperous. No individual is interested in the expansion of the 
size of his nation's territory, as he cannot derive any gain from such 
an aggrandizement. Conquest docs not pay and war becomes obsolete. 

In the ages preceding the rise of libcralism and the evolution of 
modern capitalism, people for the most part consumed only what 
could be produced out of raw matcrials available in their own neigh- 
borhood. The development of the international division of labor has 
radically altered this state of affairs. Food and raw materials imported 
from distant countries are articles of mass consumption. The most 
advanced European nations could do without these imports only at 
the price of a very considcratde lowering of their standard of living. 
They must pay fbr the badly needed purchase of minerals, lumber, 
oil, cereals, fat, coffce, tea, cocoa, fruit, wool, and cotton by cxport- 
ing manufactures, most of them processed out of imported raw 
materials. Their vital interests are hurt by the protectionist trade poli- 
cies of the countries producing these primary products. 

Two hundred years ago it was of little concern to the Swedes or 

the Swiss whether or not a non-European country was efficient in 

utilizing its natural rcsourccs. But today economic backwardness in 

a foreign country, endowed by rich natural resources, hurts the inter- 

ests of all those w-hose standard of living could be raised if a more 

appropriate mode of utilizing this natural wealth were adopted. The 

principle of each nation's unrestricted sovereignty is irz a world of 

government interference with business a challenge ;o all other nations. 


Human Action 

Thc conflict between the have-nots and the haves is a real conflict. 
But it is present onIy in a world in which any sovereign government 
is free 60 hurt the interests of all peoples-its own included-by de-
priving the consumers of the advantages a better exploitation of this 
country's resources would give them. It is not sovereignty as such 
that makes for war, but sovereignty of governments not entirely com- 
mitted to the principles of the marker economy. 

Liberalismdid not and does not build its hopes upon abolition of the 
sovereignty of the various national governments, a vcnture which 
would result in endless wars. It aims at a general recognition of the 
idea of economic frcedom. If all peoples become liberal and conceive 
that economic frccdom best serves their own interests, national sover- 
eignty will no longer engender conflict and war. What is needed to 
make peace durable is neither international treaties and covenants nor 
international tribunals and organizations like thc defunct League of 
Nations or its successor, the United Nations. If the principle of the 
markct cconomy is universally accepted, such makeshifts arc un-
necessary; if it is not accepted, they are futile. Durable peace can 
only be the outgrouth of a change in ideologies. As long as the 
peoples cling to the Montaigne dogma and think that they cannot 
prosper economically except at the expense of other nations, peace 
will ncver be anything other than a period of preparation for the next 
war. 

Economic nationalism is incompatible with durable peace. Yet 
economic nationalism is unavoidable where there is government in- 
terference with business. Protectionism is indispensable where there 
is no domestic free trade., Where there is governmcnt interference 
with business, free trade even in the short run would frustrate thc 
aims sought by the various interventionist measures.16 

It is an illusion to believe that a nation would lastingly tolerate 
other nations' policies which harm the vital interest of its own citi- 
zens. Let us assume that the United Nations had been established in 
the year 1600 and that the Indian tribes of hTorth America had been 
admitted as mcrnbers of this organization. Then the sovereignty of 
these Indians would have been recognized as inviolable. They would 
have been given the right to exclude all aliens from entering thcir 
territory and from exploiting its rich natural resources which they 
thcmselvcs did not know how to utilize. Does anybody rcally believe 
that any international covenant or charter could have prevented the 
Europeans from invading these countries?

Harmony and Conflict of Interests 

Many of the richest deposits of various mineral substances are lo- 
cated in areas whose inhabitants are too ignorant, too inert, or too 
dull to take advantage of the riches nature has bestowed upon them. 
If the governmcnts of these countries prevent aliens from exploiting 
these deposits, or if their conduct of public affairs is so arbitrary that 
no foreign investments are safe, serious harm is inflicted upon all those 
foreign peoples whose material well-being could be improved by a 
more adequate utilization of the deposits concerned. It does not matter 
whether the policies of these governments are the outcome of a 
general cultural backwardness or of the adoption of the now fashion- 
able ideas of interventionism and economic nationalism. The result is 
the same in both cases. 

There is no use in conjuring away these conflicts by wishful think-
ing. What is needed to make peace durable is a change in ideologies. 
What generates war is the economic philosophy almost universally 
espoused today by governments and political parties. As this philoso- 
phy sees it, there prevail within the unhampered market economy 
irreconciIable conflicts between the interests of various nztions. Free 
trade harms a nation; it brings about impoverishment. It is the duty 
of government to prevent the evils of free trade by trade barriers. 
We may, for the sake of argument, disregard the fact that protec- 
tionism also hurts the interests of the nations which resort to it. But 
there can be no doubt that protectionism aims at damaging the interests 
of foreign peoples and really does damage them. It is an illusion to 
assume that those injured will tolerate other nations' protectionism 
if they believe that they are strong enough to brush it away by the 
use of arms. The philosophy of protectionism is a philosophy of war. 
The wars of our age are not at variance with popular economic 
doctrines; they are, on the contrary, the inescapable result of a con- 
sistent application of these doctrines. 

The League of Nations did not fail because its organization was 
deficient. It failed because it lacked the spirit of genuine liberalism. 
It was a convention of governmcnts imbued with the spirit of eco- 
nomic nationalism and entirely committed to the principles of eco- 
nomic warfare. While the delegates indulged in mere academic talk 
about good will among the nations, the governments whom they 
represented inflicted a good deal of evil upon all other nations. The 
two decades of the League's functioning were marked by each nation's 
adamant economic warfare against all other nations. The tariff pro-
tectionism of the years before 1914was mild indeed when compared 
with what developed in the 'twenties and 'thirties-viz., embargoes, 


Human Action 

quantitative trade control, foreign exchange control, monetary de- 
valuation, and so on.17 

The prospects for the United hlations are not better, but rather 
worse. Every nation looks upon imports, especially upon imports 
of manufactured goods, as upon a disaster. It is the avowed goal of 
almost all countries to bar foreign manufactures as much as possible 
from access to their domestic markets. Almost all nations are fighting 
against the specter of an unfavorable balance of trade. They do not 
want to cooperate; they want to protect themselves against the alleged 
dangers of cooperation.

economic warfare, cf. Rappard, Le Nationalisme e'conomique et la Sociite' des 
Nations (Paris, I 938).

Social Cooperation Without n Market 

XXV. THE IMAGINARY COSSTRUCTION 
OF A SOCIALIST SOCIETY 
I. The Historical Origin of the Socialist Idea 
$Nthe social philosophers of the eightcenth ccntury laid the W"foundations of praxeology and cconornics, they were con-
f rontcd with an almost universally accepted and uncontested distinc-
tion between the petty sclfish individuals and the state, the representa- 
tive of the interests df the wholc society. Howcver, at that tirne the 
deification process which finally eIcvated thc men managing the social 
apparatus of coercion and compulsion into thc ranks of the gods was 
not yet complcted. What people had in mind when speaking of 
government was not yet thc quasi-theological notion of an ornnipo-
tent and omniscient deity, the pcrfect embodiment of all virtues; it 
was thc concrcte governments ns they acted on the political scene. It 
was the various sovereign entities whose territorial size was the out- 
come of bloody wars, diplomatic intrigues, and dynastic intermar- 
riage and succession. It was the princes whose prjvate domain and 
rcveilue were in many countries not yet separated from the public 
treasury, and oligarchic republics, like Venice and some of the Swiss 
cantons, in which the ultimate objective of the conduct of public 
affairs was to enrich the ruIing aristocracy. The interests of these 
rulers were in opposition to thosc of their "selfish" subjects cxclusivelv 
committed to the pursuit of their own happiness on the one han& 
and to those of foreign govcrnrnents longing for booty and territorial 
aggrandizement on the other hand. In deaiing with thew antagonisms, 
the authors of books on public affairs wcre ready to espouse the cause 
of their own country's government. They assumed quitc candidly 
that the rulcrs are the champions of the intercsts of the whole society, 
irreconcilably conflicting with thosc of the individuals. In checking 
the selfishness of their subjects, governrncnts were promoting the 
wclfare of the whole of socicty as against the mean conccrns of 
individuals. 

The liberal philosophy discarded these notions. From its point of 
view there are within the unharnpcred market societv no conflicts of 
the rightly understood interests. The intcrests of the citizens are not 


Human Action 

opposed to those of the nation, the interests of each nation are not 
opposed to those of other nations. 

Yet in demonstrating this thesis the liberal philosophers them- 
selves contributed an essential element to the notion of the godlike 
state. They substituted in their inquiries the image of an ideal state 
for the real states of their age. They constructed the vague image of 
a government whose only objective is to make its citizens happy. 
This ideal had certainly no counterpart in the Europe of the ancien 
rkgime. In this Europe there were German princelings who sold their 
subjects like cattle to fight the wars of foreign nations; thcre were 
kings who seized every opportunity ,to rush upon weaker neighbors; 
there was the shocking experience of the partitions of Poland; there 
was France successively governed by the century's most profligate 
men, the Regent OrlCans and Louis XV; and there was Spain, ruled by 
the ill-bred paramour of an adulterous queen. However, the liberal 
philosophers deal only with a state which has nothing in common 
with these governments of corrupt courts and aristocracies. The state, 
as it appears in their writings, is governed by a perfect superhuman 
being, a king whose only aim is to promote the welfare of his subjects. 
Starting from this assumption, they raise the question of whether the 
actions of the individual citizens when left free from any authoritarian 
~ontrol would not develop along lines of which this good and wise 
king would disapprove. The liberal philosopher answers this question 
in the negative. It is true, he admits, that the entrepreneurs are selfish 
and seek their own profit. However, in the market economy they can 
earn profits only by satisfying in the best possible way the most 
urgent needs of the consumers. The objectives of entrepreneurship 
do not differ from those of the perfect king. For this benevolent 
king too aims at nothing else than such an employment of the means 
of production that the maximum of consumer satisfaction can be 
reached. 

It is obvious that this reasoning introduces value judgments and 
political bias into rhe rrearment of the probiems. This paternai ruicr 
is merely an alias for the economist who by means of this trick elevates 
his persona1 value judgments to the dignity of a universally valid 
standard of absolute eternal values. The author identifies himself with 
the perfect king and calls the ends he himself would choose if he 
were equipped with this king's power, welfare, commonweal, and 
volkswirtschaftliche productivity as distinct from the ends toward 
which the selfish individuals are striving. He is so nai've as not to see 
that this hypothetical chief of state is merely a hypostatization of his 
own arbitrary vaIue judgments, and blithely assumes that he has dis- 


A Socialist Society 

covered an incontestable standard of good and evil. Masked as the 
benevolent paternal autocrat, the author's own Ego is enshrined as 
the voice of the absolute moral law. 

The essential characteristic of the imaginary construction of this 
king's ideal regime is that all its citizens are unconditionally subject 
to authoritarian control. The king issues orders and all obey. This 
is not a market economy; there is no longer private ownership of the 
mcans of production. The terminology of the ~narkct economy is 
retained, but in fact there is no longer any private ownership of the 
means of production, no real buying and selling, and no market prices. 
Production is not directed by the conduct of the consumers displayed 
on the market, but by authoritarian decrees. The authority assigns to 
everybody his station in the system of the social division of labor, 
determines what should be produced, and how and what each individ- 
ual is aIlowed to consume. This is what nowadays can properly be 
called the German variety of socialist management.l 

Now, the economists compare this hypothetical system, which in 
their eyes embodies the moral law itself, with the market economy. 
The best they can say of the market economy is that it does not 
bring about a state of affairs differcnt from that prodnced by the 
supremacy of the perfect autocrat. They approve of the market 
economy only because its operation, as they see it, ultimately attains 
the same results the pcrfcct king would aim at. Thus the simplc identi- 
fication of what is morally good and econo~nically expedient with the 
plans of the totalitarian dictator that characterizes all champions of 
planning and socialism was not contested by many of the old liberals. 
One must even assert that they originated this confusion when they 
substituted the ideal image of the perfect state for the wicked and 
unscrupulous despots and politicians of the real world. Of course, 
for the liberal thinker this perfect state was merely an auxiliary tool 
of reasoning, a model with which he compared the operation of the 
market economy. But it was not ama~ing that people finally raised 
the question as TO why one shouid nor: transfer this ideai state from 
the realm of thought into the realm of reality. 

All older social reformers wanted to realize the good society by 

a confiscation of a11 private property and its subsequent redistribution; 

each man's share should be equal to that of every other, and continuous 

vigilance by the authorities should safeguard the preservation of this 

equalitarian system. These plans became unrealizable when the large- 

scale enterprises in manufacturing, mining, and transportation ap- 

peared. There cannot be any question of splitting up large-scale busi- 

I. Cf. below, pp. 713-714. 

Human Action 

ness units and distributing the fragments in equal shares.? The age-old 
program of redistribution was superseded by the idea of socialization. 
The means of production were to be expropriated, but no redistribu- 
tion was to be resorted to. The state itself was to run all the plants 
and farms. 

This inference became logically inescapable as soon as people began 
to ascribe to the state not only moral but also intellectual perfection. 
The liberal philosophers had described their imaginary state as an 
unselfish entity, exclusively committed to the best possible improve- 
ment of its subjects' welfare. They had discovered that in the frame 
of a market society the citizens' selfishness must bring about the sanic 
results that this unselfish state would seek to realize; it was precisely 
this fact that justified the preservation of the market economy in 
their eyes. But things became different as soon as people began to 
ascribe to the state not only the best intentions but also omniscience. 
Then one could not help concluding that the infallible state as in 
a position to succeed in the conduct of production activities better 
than erring individuals. It would avoid all those errors that often 
frustrate the actions of entrepreneurs and capitalists. There woiild no 
longer be maIinvestnient or squandering of scarce factors of produc- 
tion; wealth would multiply. The "anarchy" of production appears 
wasteful when contrasted with the planning of the omniscient state. 
The socialist mode of production then appears to be the only reason- 
able system, and the market economy seems the incarnation of un- 
reason. In the eyes of the rationalist advocates of socialism, the marltct 
economy is simply an incomprehensible aberration of mankind. In 
the eyes of those influenced by historicism, the market economy is 
the social order of an inferior stage of human evolution which the 
inescapable process of progressive perfection wiIl eliminate in order 
to establish the more adequate system of socialism. Both lines of 
thought agree that reason itself postulates the transition to socialism. 

What the na'ive mind calls reason is nothing but the absolutization 
of its own value judgments. The individual simpIy identifies the prod- 
ucts of his own reasoning with the shaky notion of an absolute reason. 
So socialist ever gave a thought to the possibility that the abstract 
entity which he wants to vest with unlimited power-whether it is 
called humanity, society, nation, state, or government-could act in 
a way of which he himself disapproves. A socialist advocates socialism 
because he is fully convinced that the supreme director of the socialist 
commonwealth will be reasonable from his-the individual socialist's 

2. There are, however, even today in the United States people who want to 
knock to pieces large-scale production and to do away with corporate business. 

A Socialist Society 

-point of view, that he will aim at those ends of which he-the indi-
vidual socialist-fully approves, and that he will try to attain these 
ends by choosing means which he-the individual socialist-would 
also choose. Every socialist calls only that system a genuinely socialist 
system in which these conditions are completely fulfilled; all other 
brands claiming the name of socialism are counterfeit systems cntirely 
different from true socialism. Every socialist is a disguised dictator. 
Woe to all dissentcrs! They have forfeited their right to live and 
must be "liquidated." 

The market economy makes peaceful cooperation among people 
possible in spite of the fact that they disagree with regard to their 
value judgments. In the plans of the socialists there is no room left 
for dissenting views. Their principle is Gleichschaltu7tg, perfect uni- 
formity enforced by the police. 

People frequently call socialism a religion. It is indccd the religion 
of self-deification. The State and Government of which the planners 
speak, the People of the nationalists, the Society of the Marxians and 
the Humanity of the positivists are names for the God of the new 
religions. But all these idols are merely aliases for the individual rc- 
former's own will. In ascribing to his idol all those attributes which the 
theologians ascribe to God, the inflated Ego glorifies itsclf. It is infi- 
nitely good, omnipotent, on~nipresent, omniscient, eternal. It is the 
only perfect being in this imperfect world. 

Economics is not called to examine blind faith and bigotry. The 
faithful are proof against every criticism. In their eyes criticism is 
scandalous, a blasphemous revolt of wicked men against the imperish- 
able splendor of their jdoI. Economics deals merely with the socialist 
plans, not with the psychological factors that impel people to espouse 
the religion of statolatry. 

2. The Socialist Doctrine 
Karl Marx was not the originator of socialism. The idca of socialism 
was fully elaborated when Marx adopted the socialist creed. Nothing 
could be added to the praxeological description of the sociaIist system 
as developed by his predecessors, and Marx did not add anything. 
Neither did Marx refute the objections against the feasibility, dcsir- 
ability, and advantageousness of socialisn~ raised by earlier authors 
and by his contemporaries. He never even embarked upon such a 
venture, fully aware as he was of his inability to succeed :in it. All that 
he did to fight the criticisms of socialism was to hatch out the doctrine 
of polylogism. 


Human Action 
However, the services that Marx rendered to the socialist propa- 
ganda were not confincd to the invention of polylogism. Still more 
important was his doctrine of the inevitability of socialism. 
Marx lived in an age in which the doctrine of evolutionary melio- 
rism was almost generally accepted. The invisible hand of Providence 
leads men, independently of their wills, from lower and Iess perfect 
stages to higher and more perfect ones. There prevails in the course 
of human history an inevitable tendency toward progress and im- 
provement. Each later stage of human affairs is, by virtue of its being 
a later stage, also a higher and better stage. Nothing is permanent in 
human conditions except this irresistible urge toward progress. Hegel, 
who died a few years before Marx entered the scene, had presented 
this doctrine in his fascinating philosophy of history, and Nietzsche, 
who entered the scene just at the time when Marx withdrew, made 
it the focal point of his no less fascinating writings. It has been the 
myth of the last two hundred years. 
What Marx did was to integrate the socialist creed into this melio- 
rist doctrine. The coming of sociaIism is inevitable, and this by itself 
proves that socialism is a higher and more perfect state of human 
affairs than the preceding state of capitalism. It is vain to discuss the 
pros and cons of socialism. Socialism is bound to come "with the 
inexorability of a law of nature." Only morons can be so stupid as 
to question whether what is bound to come is more beneficial than 
what preceded it. Only bribed apologists of the unjust claims of the 
exploiters can be so insolent as to find any fault with socialism. 
If we attribute the epithet Marxian to all those who agree with 
this doctrine, we must call the immense majority of our contempo- 
raries Marxians. These peopIe agree that the coming of socialism is 
both absolutely inevitable and highly desirable. The "wave of the 
future" drives mankind toward socialism. Of course, they disagree 
with one another as to who is to bc entrusted with the captaincy of 
the socialist ship of state. There are many candidates for this job. 
Marx tried to prove his prophecy in a twofold way. The first is 
the method of Hegelian dialectics. Capitalist private property is the 
first negation of individual private property and must beget its own 
negation, viz., the establishment of public property in the means of 
production.* Things were as simple as that for the hosts of Hegelian 
writers who infested Germany in the days of Marx. 
The second method is the demonstration of the unsatisfactory con- 
ditions brought about by capitalism. Marx's critique of the capitalist 

3. Cf. Marx, Das Kapital (7th ed. Hamburg, 1914), I, 728. 
4. lbid. 

A Socialist Society 

mode of production is entirely wrong. Even the most orthodox 
Marxians are not bold enough to support seriously its essential thesis, 
namely, that capitalism results in a progressive impoverishment of 
the wage earners. But if one admits for the sake of argument all the 
absurdities of the Marxian analysis of capitalism, nothing is yet won 
for the demonstration of the two theses, viz., that socialism is 
bound to come and that it is not only a better system than capitalism, 
but even the most perfect system, the final realization of which will 
bring to man eternal bliss in his earthly life. All the sophisticated 
syllogisms of the ponderous volumes published by Marx, Engels, and 
hundreds of Marxian authors cannot conceal the fact that the only 
and ultimate source of Marx7s prophecy is an alleged inspiration by 
virtue of which Marx claims to have guessed the plans of the myste- 
rious powers determining the course of history. Like Hegel, Marx was 
a prophet communicating to the people the revelation that an inner 
voice had imparted to him. 

The outstanding fact in the history of socialism between 1848 and 
1920was that the essential problems concerning its working were 
hardly ever touched upon. The Marxian taboo branded all attempts 
to examine the economic problems of a socialist commonwealth as 
"unscientific." Nobody was bold enough to defy this ban. It was 
tacitly assumed by both the friends and the foes of sociaIism that 
socialism is a realizable system of mankind's cconornic organization. 
The vast literature concerning socialism dealt with alleged shortcom- 
ings of capitalism and with the general cultural implications of social- 
ism. It never dealt with the economics of socialism as such. 

The socialist creed rests upon thee dogmas: 

First: Society is an omnipotent and omniscient being, free from 
human frailty and weakness. 

Second: The coming of socialism is inevitable. 

Third:As history is a continuous progress from less perfect con- 
ditions to more perfect conditions, the coming of socialism is desirable. 

For praxeology and economics the only problem to be discussed 
in regard to socialism is this: Can a socialist system operate as a system 
of the division of labor? 

3. The Praxeological Character of Socialism 
The essential mark of socialism is that one will alone acts. It is 
immaterial whose wiIl it is. The director may be an anointed king 
or a dictator, ruling by virtue of his chnrisvza, he may be a Fiihrer or 
a board of Fiihrers appointed by the vote of the people. The main 


Human Action 

thing is that the employment of all factors of production is directed 
by one agency only. One will alone chooses, decides, directs, acts, 
gives orders. All the rest simply obey orders and instructions. Or- 
ganization and a planned order are substituted for the "anarchy" 
of production and for various people's initiative. Social coopera- 
tion under the division of labor is safeguarded by a system of 
hegemonic bonds in which a director peremptorily calls upon 
the obedience of all his wards. 

In terming the director society (as the Marxians do), state (with 
a capital S), government, or authority, pcople tend to forget that 
the director is always a human being, not an abstract notion or a 
mythical collective entity. We may admit that the director or the 
board of directors are people of superior ability, wise and full of 
good intentions. But it would be nothing short of idiocy to assume that 
they are omniscient and infallible. 

In a praxeological analysis of the problems of socialism, we are not 
concerned with the moral and ethical character of the director. 
Neither do we discuss his value judgments and his choice of ultimate 
ends. What we are dealing with is merely the question of whether 
any mortal man, equipped with the logical structure of the human 
mind, can be equal to the tasks incumbent upon a director of a socialist 
society. 

We assume that the director has at his disposal all the technological 
knowledge of his age. Moreover, hc has a complete inventorv of a11 
the material factors of production available and a roster enu&erating 
all manpower employable. In these respects the crowd of experts and 
specialists which he assembles in his offices provide him with perfect 
information and answer correctly all questions he may ask them. 
Their voluminous reports accumulate in huge piles on his desk. But 
now he must act. He must choose among an infinite variety of projects 
in such a way that no want which he hiinself considers more urgent 
remains unsatisfied because the factors of production required for its 
satisfaction are employed for the satisfaction of wants which he con- 
siders less urgent. 

It is important to realize that this problem has nothing at all to do 
with the valuation of the ultimate ends. It refers only to the means 
by the employlnent of which the ultimate ends chosen are to be 
attained. We assume that the director has made up his mind with re- 
gard to the valuation of ultimate ends. We do not question his decision. 
Neither do we raise the question of whether the people, the wards, 
approve or disapprove of their director's decisions. Wc may assume, 
for the sake of argument, that a mysterious power makes kveryone 


'4 Socialist Society 693 

agree with one another and with the director in the valuation of 
ultimate ends. 

Our problem, the crucial and only problem of socialism, is a purely 
economic problem, and as such refers merely to means and not to 
ultimate ends. 


XXVI. THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ECONOXiIIC 
CALCULATION UNDER SOCIALISM 

I. The Problem 
T 
T
HE director wants to build a house. Now, there are many methods 
that can be resorted to. Each of them offers, from the point 
of view of the director, certain advantages and disadvantages with 
regard to the utilization of the future building, and results in a diffcr- 
ent duration of the building's serviceableness; each of them requires 
other expenditures of building materials and labor and absorbs other 
periods of production. Which method should the director choose; 
He cannot reduce to a common deno~ninator the items of various 
materials and various kinds of labor to be expended. Therefore he 
cannot compare them. Hc cannot attach either to the waiting time 
(period of production) or to the duration of serviceableness a definite 
numerical expression. In short, he cannot, in comparing costs to be 
expended and gains to be earned, resort to any arithmetical operation. 
The plans of his architects enumerate a vast multiplicity of various 
items in kind; they refer to the physical and chemical qualities of 
various materials and to the physical productivity of various machines, 
tools, and procedures. But all their statements remain unrelated to 
each other. There is no means of establishing any connection between 
them. 

Imagine the plight of the director when faced with a project. What 
he needs to know is whether or not the execution of the project will 
increase well-being, that is, add something to the wealth available 
without impairing the satisfaction of wants which he considers more 
urgent. But none of the reports he receives give him any clue to the 
solution of this problem. 

We may for the sake of argument at first disregard the dilemmas 
involved in the choice of consumers' goods to be produced. We may 
assume that this problem is settled. But there is the embarrassing 
multitude of producers' goods and the infinite variety of procedures 
that can be resorted to for manufacturing definite consumers' goods. 
The most advantageous location of each industry and the optimum 
size of each plant and of each piece of equipment must be determined. 


Economic Calculation under Socialism 

695 

Olle must determine what kind of mechanical power should be em- 
ployed in each of them, and which of the various formulas for the 
production of this energy should be applied. All these problems are 
raised daily in thousands and thousands of cases. Each case offers 
special conditions and requires an individual solution appropriate to 
these special data. The number of elements with which the director's 
decision has to deal is much greater than would be indicated by a 
merely technological description of the available producers' goods 
in terms of physics and chemistry. The Iocation of each of them must 
be taken into consideration as well as the serviceableness of the 
capital investments made in the past for their utilization. The director 
does not simply have to deal with coal as such, but with thousands 
and thousands of pits already in operation in various places, and with 
the possibilities for digging new pits, with the various methods of 
mining in each of them, with the different qualities of the coal in 
various deposits, with the various methods for utilizing the coal for 
the production of heat, power, and a great number of derivatives. 
It is permissible to say that the present state of technological knowl- 
edge makes it possible to produce almost anything out of almosr every- 
thing. Our ancestors, for instance, knew only a limited number of 
employments for wood. Modern technology has added a multitude 
of possible new employments. Wood can be used for the production 
of paper, of various textiie fibers, of foodstuffs, drugs, and many 
other synthetic products. 

~odaytwo methods are resorted to for providing a city with clean 
water. Either one brings the water over long distances in aqueducts, 
an ancient method long practiced, or one chemically purifies the 
water avaiIable in the city's neighborhood. Why does one not produce 
water synthetically in factories? Modern technology could easily 
solve the technological problems involved. The average man in his 
mental inertia is ready to ridicule such projects as sheer lunacy. How- 
ever, thc only reason why the synthetic production of drinking water 
today-perhaps not at a later day-is out of the question is that 
economic calculation in terms of money shows that it is a more 
expensive procedure than other methods. Eliminate economic calcula- 
tion and you have no means of making a rational choice between the 
various alternatives. 

The socialists, it is true, object that economic calculation is not 
infallible. They say that the capitalists sometimes make mistakes in 
their calculation. Of course, this happens and will always happen. 
For all human action points to the future and the future is always 
uncertain. The most carefuIly elaborated plans are frustrated if ex- 


Human Action 

pectations concerning the futurc are dashed to the ground. However, 
this is quite a different problem. Today we calculate from the point 
of view of our present knowledge and of our present anticipation 
of future conditions. We do not deal with the problcm of whether 
or not the director will be able to anticipate futurc conditions. What 
we have in mind is that the director cannot calculate from the point of 
view of his own present value judgments and his own present anticipa- 
tions of futurc conditions, whatever they may be. If he invests today 
in the canning industry, it may happen that a change in consumers' 
tastes or in the hygienic opinions concerning the wholesomeness of 
canned food will one day turn his investment into a malinvestment. 
Hut how can he find out today how to build and equip a cannery 

most economically? 

Some raiIroad lines constructed at the turn of the century would not 
have been built if people had at that time anticipated the impending 
advance of motoring and aviation. But those who at that time built 
railroads knew which of the various possible alternatives for the 
realization of their plans they had to choose fro111 the point of view 
of their appraisements and anticipations and of the market prices of 
their day in which the valuations of the consumers were reflected. 
It is precisely this insight that the director will lack. He will be 
like a sailor on the high seas unfamiliar with the methods of navigation, 
or like a medieval scholar entrusted with the technical operation of a 
railroad engine. 

We have assumed that the director has already made up his mind 

with regard to the construction of a definite plant or building. HoM.- 

ever, in order to male such a decision he already needs econonlic 

calculation. If a hydroelectric power station is to be built, one must 

know whether or not this is the most economical way to produce the 

energy needed. How can he know this if he cannot calculate costs and 

output? 

We may admit that in its initial period a socialist regime couId to 

some extent rely upon the experience of the preceding age of capital- 

ism. But what is to be done later, as conditions change more and morc? 

Of what use could the prices of 1900 be for the director in 19+9? 

And what use can the director in 1980 derive from the knowledge of 

the prices of I 949? 

The paradox of "planning" is that it cannot plan, because of the 

absence of economic calculation. What is called a planned economy 

is no economy at all. It is just a system of groping about in the dark. 

There is no question of a rational choice of means for the best possible 


Econolnic Calculation under Socialism 

attainment of the ultimate ends sought. What is called conscious 
planning is precisely the elimination of conscious purposive action. 

2. Past Failures to Conceive the Problem 
For more than a hundred years the substitution of socialist planning 
for private enterprise has been the main politicaI issue. Thousands 
and thousands of books have been published for and against the com- 
munist plans. No other subject has been more eagerly discussed in 
private circles, in the press, in public gatherings, in the meetings of 
learned societies, in election campaigns, and in parliaments. Wars have 
been fought and rivers of blood have been shed for the cause of 
socialism. Yet in all these years the essential question has not been 
raised. 

It is true that some eminent economists-Hermann Heinrich Cos- 
sen, Albcrt Schaffle, Vilfredo Pareto, Nkolaas G. Pierson, Enrico 
Barone-touched upon the problem. But, with the exception of 
Pierson, they did not penetrate to the core of the problem, and they 
all failed to recognize its primordial importance. Neither did they 
venture to integrate it into the system of the theory of human action. 
It was these failures which prevented peoplc from paying attention 
to their observations. They were disregarded and soon fell into 
oblivion. 

It would be a serious mistake to blame the E3istorical School and 
Institutionalism for this neglect of mankind's most vital problem. 
These two lines of thought fanatically disparage economics, the 
"dismal science," in the interests of their interventionist or socialist 
propaganda. However, they have not succeeded in suppressing the 
study of economics entirely. The puzzling thing is not why the de- 
tractors of economics failed to recognize the problem, but why the 
economists were guilty of the same fault. 

It is the two fundamental errors of mathematical economics that 

-----* L-:-J:-*-J 

IIIU3L UC JIIUILLCU. 


The mathematical economists are almost exclusively intent upon 
the study of what they call economic equilibrium and the static state. 
Recourse to the imaginary construction of an evenly rotating 
economy is, as has been pointed out,l an indispensable mental tool 
of economic reasoning. But it is a grave mistake to consider this 
auxiliary tool as anything else than an imaginary construction, and to 
overlook the fact that it has not only no counterpart in reality, but 

I. Cf.above, pp. 247-251. 

Human Action 

cannot even be thought through consistently to its ultimate logical 
consequences. The mathematical economist, blinded by the prepos- 
session that economics must be constructed according to the pattern 
of Newtonian mechanics and is open to treatment by mathernatica1 
methods, misconstrues entirely the subject matter of his investigations. 
He no longer deals with human action but with a soulless tnechanisn~ 
mysteriously actuated by forces not open to further analysis. In the 
imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy there is, of 
course, no room for the entrepreneurial function. Thus the mathe- 
matical economist eliminates the entrepreneur from his thought. He 
has no need for this mover and shaker whose never ceasing interven- 
tion prevents the imaginary system from reaching the state of perfect 
equilibrium and static conditions. He hates the entrepreneur as a 
disturbing element. The ~rices of the factors of production, as the 
mathematical economist sees it, are determined by thc intersection of 
two curves, not by human action. 

Moreover, in drawing his cherished curves of cost and price, the 
mathematical economist fails to see that the reduction of costs and 
prices to homogeneous magnitudes implies the use of a common 
medium of exchange. Thus he creates the illusion that calculation 
of costs and prices could be resorted to even in the absencc of a com- 
mon denominator of the exchange ratios of the factors of production. 

The result is that from the writings of the mathematical economists 
the imaginary construction of a socialist commonu~ealth emerges 
as a realizable system of cooperation under the division of labor, 
as a fuI1-fledged alternative to the economic system based on private 
control of the means of production. The director of the sociaIist 
community will be in a position to allocate the various factors of 
production in a rational way, i.e., on the ground of calculation. Men 
can have both socialist cooperation under the division of labor and 
rational employment of the factors of production. They are free to 
adopt socialism without abandoning economy in the choice of means. 
Socialism does not enjoin the renunciation of rationality in the em- 
ployment of the factors of production. It is a variety of rational social 
action. 

An apparent verification of these errors was seen in the experience 

of the socialist governments of Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. 

People did not realize that these were not isolated socialist systems. 

They were operating in an environment in which the price system 

still worked. They could resort to economic calculation on the ground 

of the prices established abroad. Without the aid of these prices their 

actions would have been aimless and planless. Only because they were

able to refer to these foreign prices wcre they abIe to calculate, to 
keep books, and to prepare their much talked about plans. 

3. Recent Suggestions for Socialist Economic Calculation 
The socialist tracts deal with everything except the essential and 
unique problem of socialism, viz., ceonornic calculation. It is only 
in the last years that socialist writers have no longer been able to avoid 
paying attention to this primordial matter. They have begun to suspect 
that the Marxian technique of smearing "bourgeois" econo~nics is 
not an entirely sufficient method for the realization of the socialist 
utopia. They have tried to substitute a theory of socialism for the 
scurrilous Hegelian metaphysics of the Marxian doctrine. They have 
embarked upon designing schemes for socialist economic calculation. 
Of course, they have lamentably failed in this task. It would hardly be 
necessary to deal with their spurious suggestions wcre it not for the 
fact that such examination offers a good opportunity to bring into 
relief fundamental features both of the market society and of the 
imaginary construction of a nonmarket society. 

The various schemes proposed can be classified in the following 
way: 

I. Calculation in kind is to be substituted for calculation in terms 
of moncy. This method is worthless. One cannot add or subtract 
numbers of different kinds (hctcrogeneous quantities) ." 
2. Starting from the ideas of the labor theory of valuc the labor- 
hour is recommended as the unit of calculation.-his suggcstion does 
not take into account the original material factors of production and 
ignores the diffcrent qualities of work accomplished in thc various 
labor-hours worked by the same and by different people. 
3. Thc unit is to be a "quantity" of utiIity. However, acting man 
does not measure utility. He arranges it in scales of gradation. Market 
prices are not expressive of equivalence, but of a divergence in the

the fundamental theorem of modern economics, namely, that the value

z. It would hardly be worth while even to mention this suggestion if it were 
nor the solution that emanated from the very busy and obtrusive circlc of the 
"logicd positivists" who flagrantly advertise their program of the "unity of 
science." Cf. the writings of the late chief organizer of this group, Otto Neurath, 
who in 1919acted as the hcad of the socialization bureau of the short-lived Soviet 
republic of Munich, especially his Durch die Kriegswirtschaft zur Nnturalwirt- 
scb~ft(Munich, 1919).pp. 2 16ff. Cf. also C.Landauer, Plirnwirtschaft und Ver- 
kek~swi~tschnf(Munich and Leipzig, 193I). 12z.

4. Calculation is to be made possible by the establishment of an 
artificial quasi-market. This scheme is dealt with in section 5 of this 
chapter. 
5. Calculation is to be made with the aid of the differential equa- 
tions of mathematical catallactics. This scheme is dealt with in section 
6 of this chapter. 
6. Calculation is to be madc superfluous by resorting to the method 
of trial and error. This idea is dealt with in section 4 of this chapter. 
4. Trial and Error 
-.

I he entrepreneurs and capitalists do not have advance assurance 
about whether their plans are the most appropriate solution for the 
allocation of factors of production to the various branchcs of industry. 
It is only later experience that shows them after the event whether 
they were right or wrong in their enterprises and investments. The 
method they apply is the neth hod of trial and error. Why, say some 
sociaIists, should not the socialist director resort to the samc method? 

The method of trial and error is applicable in all cases in which 
the correct solution is recognizable as such by unmistakable marks 
not dependent on the method of trial and error itself. If a man mis- 
lays his wallet, he may hunt for it in various places. If he finds it, he 
recognizes it as his property; there is no doubt about the success of 
the method of trial and error applied; he has solved his problem. when 
Ehrlich was looking for a re~nedy for syphilis, he tested hundreds of 
drugs until he found what he was searching for, a drug that killed the 
spirochetes without damaging the human body. The mark of the 
correct solution, the drug number 606, was that it combined these two 
quaIities, as could be learned from laboratory experiment and from 
clinical experience. 

Things are quite diffcrcnt if the only mark of the correct solution 
is that it has been reached by the applkation of a method considered 
appropriate for thc solution of the problem. 'The correct result of a 
multiplication of two factors is recognizable only as the result of a 
correct application of the process indicated by arithmctic. One may 
try to guess the correct result by trial and crror. But here the method 
of trial and error is no substitute for the arithmetical process. It would 
be quite futile if the arithmetical process did not provide a yardstick 
for discrin~inating what is incorrect from what is correct. 

If one wants to call entrepreneurial action an application of the 
method of trial and error, one must not forget that the correct solution 
is easily recognizable as such; it is the emergence of a surplus of pro- 


Economic Calczdation vnder Socialism

ceeds over costs. Profit tells the entrepreneur that the consumers ap- 
prove of his ventures; loss, that they disapprove. 

The problem of socialist economic calculation is precisely this: 
that in the absence of market prices for the factors of production, a 
computation of profit or loss is not feasible. 

We may assume that in the socialist commonwealth there is a market 
for consumers' goods and that money prices for consumers' goods are 
determined on this market. We may assume that the director assigns 
periodically to every member a certain amount of money and sells the 
consumers' goods to those bidding the highest prices. Or we may as 
well assume that a certain portion of the various consumers' goods 
in kind is allotted to each member and that the members are free to 
exchange these goods against other goods on a market in which 
the transactions are effected through a common medium of exchange, 
a sort of money. But the characteristic mark of the socialist system is 
that the producers' goods are controIled by one agency only in whose 
name the director acts, that they are neither bought nor sold, and 
that there are no prices for them. Thus there cannot be any question 
of comparing input and output by the methods of arithmetic. 

We do not assert that the capitalist mode of economic calculation 
guarantees the absolutely best solution of the allocation of factors of 
production. Such absolutely perfect solutions of any problem are 
out of reach of mortal men. What the operation of a market not 
sabotaged by the interference of compulsion and coercion can bring 
about is merely the best solution accessible to the human rnind under 
the given state of technological knowledge and the intellectual abilities 
of the age's shrewdest men. As soon as any man discovers a discrepancy 
between the real state of production and a realizable better state, the 
profit motive pushes him toward the utmost effort to realize his plans. 
The sale of his products will show whether he was right or wrong 
in his anticipations. The market daily tries the entrepreneurs anew and 
eliminates those who cannot stand the test. It tends to entrust the 
conduct of business affairs to those men who have succeeded in filling 
the most urgent wants of the consumers. This is the only important 
respect in which one can call the market economy a system of trial 
and error. 

5. The Quasi-market 
The distinctive mark of socialism is the oneness and indivisibility 
of the will directing all production activities within the whole social 

j. "Better" means, of course, more satisfactory from the point of view of the 
consumers buying on the market. 

Human Action 

system. When the socialists decIare that "order" and "organization" 
are to be substituted for the "anarchy" of production, conscious action 
for the alleged planlessness of capitalism, true cooperation for compe- 
tition, production for use for production for profit, what they have 
in mind is always the substitution of the exclusive and monopolistic 
power of only one agency for the infinite multitude of the plans of 
the individual consumers and those attending to the wishes of the con-
sumers, the entrepreneurs and capitalists. The essence of socialism is 
the entire elimination of the market and of catallactic competition. 
The socialist system is a system without a market and market prices 
for the factors of production and without competition; it means the 
unrestricted centralization and unification of the conduct of all affairs 
in the hands of one authority. In the drafting of the unique plan that 
directs all economic activities the citizens cooperate, if at all, only 
by electing the director or the board of directors. For the rest they 
are only subordinates, bound to obey unconditionally the orders 
issued by the director, and wards of whose well-being the director 
rakes care. All the excellences the socialists ascribe to socialism and 

all the blessings they expect from its realization are described as the 
necessary outcome of this absolute unification and centralization. 

It is therefore nothing short of a full acknowledgment of the cor- 
rectness and irrefutability of the economists' analysis and devastating 
critique of the socialists' plans that the intellectuaI leaders of socialism 
are now busy designing schemes for a socialist system in which the 
market, market prices for the factors of production, and catallactic 
competition are to be preserved. The overwhelmingly rapid triumph 
of the demonstration that no economic calculation is possible under a 
socialist system is without precedent indeed in the history of human 
thought. The socialists cannot help admitting their crushing final 
defeat. They no longer claim that socialism is tnatchlessly superior to 
capitalism because it brushes away markets, market prices, and compe- 
tition. On the contrary. They are now eager to justify socialism by 
pointing out that it is possible to preserve these institutions even under 
socialism. They are drafting outlines for a socialism in which there are 
prices and co~npetition.~ 

What these neosocialists suggest is really paradoxical. They want 
to abolish private control of the means of production, market ex- 
change, market prices, and competition. But at the same time they 
want to organize the socialist utopia in such a way that people could 

4. This refers, of course, only to those socialists or communists who, like pro- 
fessors H. D. Dicliinson and Oskar Lange, are conversant with economic thought. 
The dull hosts of the "intellectuaIs" will not abandon their superstitious belief 
in the superiority of socialism. Superstitions die hard. 

Economic Calczdation under Socialism 


act as if these things were still present. They want people to play 
market as children pIay war, railroad, or school. They do not compre- 
hend how such childish play differs from the real thing it tries to 
imitate. 

It was, say these neosocialists, a serious mistake on the part of the 
older socialists (i.e., of all socialists before 1920) to believe that social- 
ism necessarily requires the abolition of the market and of market 
exchange and even that this fact is both the essential elemcnt and 
the preeminent feature of a socialist economy. This idea is, as they 
reluctantly admit, preposterous and its realization would result in a 
chaotic muddle. But fortunately, they say, there is a better pattern for 
socialism available. It is possible to instruct the managers of the 
various production units to conduct the affairs of their unit in the 
same way they did under capitalism. The manager of a corporation 
operates in the market society not on his account and at his own 
peril, but for the bencfit of thc corporation, i.e., the shareholders. He 
will go on under socialism in the same way with the same care and 
attention. The only difference will consist in the fact that the fruits 
of his endeavors will enrich the whole society, not the shareholders. 
For the rest he will buy and sell, recruit and pay workers, and try to 
make profits in the same way he did before. The transition from the 
managerial system of mature capitalism to the managerial system of 
the planned socialist commonwealth will be smoothly effected. Noth- 
ing will change except the ownership of the capital invested. Society 
wilI be substituted for the shareholders, the people will henceforth 
pocket the dividends. That is all. 

Thc cardinal fallacy implied in this and all kindred proposals is 
that they look at the economic problem from the perspective of the 
subaltern clerk whose intellectual horizon does not extend beyond 
subordinate tasks. They consider the structure of industrial pr&uc-
tion and the allocation of capital to the various branches and produc- 
tion aggregates as rigid, and do not take into account the necessity 
of altering this structure in order to adjust it to changes in conditions. 
What they have in mind is a world in which no further changes occur 
and economic history has reached its final stage. They fail to realize 
that the operations of the corporate officers consist merely in the 
loyal execution of the tasks entrusted to them by thcir bosses, the 
shareholders, and that in performing the orders received they are 
forced to adjust themselves to the structure of the market prices, 
ultimately determined by factors other than the various manageria1 
operations. The operations of the managers, their buying and selling, 
are only a small segment of the totality of market operations. The 


Human Action 

market of the capitalist society also performs all those operations 
which allocate the capital goods to the various branches of industry. 
The entrepreneurs and capitalists establish corporations and other 
firms, enlarge or reduce their size, dissolve them or merge them 
with other enterprises; they buy and selI the shares and bonds of 
already existing and of new corporations; they grant, withdraw, 
and recover credits; in short they perform all those acts the totality 
of which is called the capital and money market. It is these financial 
transactions of promoters and speculators that direct production 
into those channels in which it satisfies the most urgent wants of 
the consumers in the best possible way. These transactions consti- 
tute the market as such. If one eliminates them, one does not preserve 
any part of the market. What remains is a fragment that cannot exist 

alone and cannot function as a market. 

The role that the loyal corporation manager plays in the conduct 

of business is much more modest than the authors of these plans assume. 

His is only a managerial function, a subsidiary assistance granted to 

the entrepreneurs and capitalists, which refers only to subordinate 

tasks. It can never become a substitute for the entrepreneurial func- 

tion.The speculators, promoters, investors and moneylenders, in 

determining the structure of the stock and commodity exchanges and 

of the money market, circumscribe the orbit within which definite 

minor tasks can be entrusted to the manager's discretion. In attending 

to these tasks the manager must adjust his procedures to the structure 

of the market created by factors which go far beyond the managerial 

functions. 

Our problem does not refer to the managerial activities; it concerns 

the allocation of capital to the various branches of industry. The ques- 

tion is: In which branches shouId production be increased or re- 

stricted, in which branches should the objective of production be 

altered, what new branches shodd be inaugurated? With regard to 

these issues it is vain to cite the honest corporation manager and his 

weii-tried efficiency. Those who confuse entrepreneurship and man- 

agement close their eyes to the economic problem. In labor disputes 

the parties are not management and labor, but entrepreneurship (or 

capital) and the salaried and wage-receiving enlployees. The capitalist 

system is not a managerial system; it is an entrepreneurial system. One 

does not detract from the merits of corporation managers if one es- 

tablishes the fact that it is not their conduct that determines the aIlo- 

cation of the factors of production to the various lines of industry. 

Nobody has ever suggested that the socialist commonwealth could

705 

invite the promoters and speculators to continue their speculations 
and then deliver their profits to the conlmon chest. Those suggesting 
a quasi-markct for the socialist system have never wanted to preserve 
the stock and commodity exchanges, the trading in futures, and the 
bankers and moneylenders as quasi-institutions. One cannot play spec-
ulation and investment. The speculators and investors expose thcir own 
wealth, their own destiny. This fact makcs them responsible to the con- 
sumers, the ultimate bosses of the capitalist economy. If one relieves 
them of this responsibility, one deprives them of thcir very character. 
They are no longer businessmen, but just a group of men to whom the 
director has handed over his main task, the supreme direction of the 
conduct of affairs. Then they-and not the nominal director-be- 
come the true directors and have to face the same problem thc nominal 
director could not solve: the problem of calculation. 

In recognition of the fact that such an idea would be simply non- 
sensical, the advocates of the quasi-market plan sometimes vaguely 
recommend another way out. The director should act as a bank 
lending the available funds to the highest biddcr. This again is an 
abortive idea. All those who can bid for these funds have, as is scIf- 
evident in a socialist order of society, no property of their own. In 
bidding they are not restrained by any financial dangers they them- 
selves run in promising too high a rate of interest for the funds bor- 
rowed. They do not in the lcast alleviate the burden of responsibility 
incumbent upon the director. The insecurity of the funds lent to 
them is in no way restricted by the partial guarantec which the bor- 
rower's own means provide in credit transactions under capitalism. 
All the hazards of this insecurity fall only upon society, the exclusive 
owner of all resourccs available. If the director were without hesita- 
tion to allocate the funds available to thosc who bid most, he u-odd 
simply put a prcmium upon audacity, carelessncss, and unreasonablc 
optimism. He would abdicate in favor of the least scrupulous vision- 
aries or scoundrels. He must reserve to himself the decision on how 
society's funds should bc utilized. Rut then we are ha& ....in ~~~h-r~

we started: the director, in his endeavors to dircct production activi- 
ties, is not aided by the division of intellectual labor which under 
capitalism provides a practicable method for cconomic calc~lation.~ 


The employment of the means of production can bc controlled 
either by private owners or by the social apparatus of coercion and 
co~npulsion. In the first case there is a market, there arc market prices 
for all factors of production, and economic cakulation is possible.

Human Action 
In the second case all these things are absent. It is vain to comfort 
oneself with the hope that the organs of the collective economy will 
bc "omnipresent" and "omniscient." We do not deal in praxeology 
with the acts of the omnipresent and omniscient Deity, but with the 
actions of men endowed with a human mind only. Such a mind can- 
not plan without economic calcdation. 
A socialist system with a marltet and market prices is as self- 
contradictory as is the notion of a triangular square. Production is 
directed either by profit-seeking businessmen or by the decisions of 
a director to whom supreme and exclusive power is entrusted. There 
arc produced either those things from the sale of which the entre- 
preneurs expect thc highest profits or those things which the director 
wants to be produced. The question is: Who should be master, the 
consumers or the director? With whom shouId the ultimate decision 
rest whether a concrete supply of factors of production should be 
empIoyed for the production of the consumers' good a or the con- 
sumers' good b? Such a question does not allow of any evasive answer. 
It must bc answered in a straightforward and unambiguous way.8 

6. Thc Diff crential Equations of Mathematical Economics 
In order to appraise adequately the idea that: the diffcrential equa- 
tions of mathematical economics could be utilized for socialist eco- 
nomic calculation, we must remember what these equations really 
mean. 

In devising the imaginary construction of an evenly rotating econ- 
omy we assume that a11 the factors of production are employed in 
such a way that each of them renders the most highly valued services 
it can possibly render. No further change in the employment of any 
of these factors could improve the state of want-satisfaction under 
prevailing conditions. This situation, in which no further changes in 
the disposition of the factors of production arc resorted to, is described 
hy systems of differential eq~zations. Howeveri tlmr eql-~ationsde r?et 
provide any information about thc human actions by means of which 
the hypothetical statc of equilibrium has been reached. All they say 
is this: If, in this state of static equilibrium, m units of n are employed 
for the production of p, and n units of n for the production of q, no 
furthcr change in the employment of the available units of a could 
result in an increment in want-satisfaction. (Even if we assume that a 
is perfectly divisible and take the unit of n as infinitesima1, it would

Economic Calculation under Socialism 

be a serious blunder to assert that the marginal utility of a is the same 
in both employments.) 

This state of equilibrium is a purely imaginary construction. In a 
changing world it can never be realized. It differs from today's state 
as well as from any other realizable state of affairs. 

In the market economy it is entrepreneurial action that again and 
again reshuffles exchange ratios and the allocation of the factors of 
production. An enterprising man discovers a discrepancy between 
the prices of the complementary factors of production and the future 
prices of the products as he anticipates them, and tries to take ad- 
vantage of this discrepancy for his own profit. The future price which 
he has in mind is, to be sure, not the hypothetical equilibrium price. 
No actor has anything to do with equilibrium and equilibrium prices; 
these notions are foreign to real life and action; thcy arc auxiliary tools 
of praxeological reasoning for which there is no mental means to con- 
ceive the ceaseless restlessness of action other than to contrast it with 
the notion of perfect quiet. For the theorists' reasoning every change 
is a step forward on a road which, provided no further new data ap- 
pear, finally leads to a state of equilibrium. Neither the theorists, nor 
the capitalists and entrepreneurs, nor the consumers, are in a position 
to form, on the ground of their familiarity with present conditions, an 
opinion about the height of such an equilibrium price. There is no 
need for such an opinion. What impels a man toward change and 
innovation is not the vision of equilibrium prices, but the anticipation 
of the height of the prices of a limited number of articles as they wilI 
prevail on the market on the date at which he plans to sell. What the 
entrepreneur, in embarking upon a definite project, has in mind 
is only the first steps of a transformation which, provided no changes 
in the data occur other than those induced by his project, would result 
in establishing the state of equilibrium. 

But for a utilization of the equations describing the state of equilib- 
rium, a knowledge of the gradation of the values of consumers' 
goods in this state of equilibrium is required. This gradation is one of 
the elemcnts of these equations assumed as known. Yet the director 
knows only his present valuations, not also his valuations under the 
hypothetical statc of equilibrium. He believes that, with regard to 
his present valuations, the allocation of the factors of production is 
unsatisfactory and wants to change it. But he knows nothing about 
how he himself will value on the day the equilibrium will be reached. 
These valuations will reflect the conditions resulting from the succes- 
sive changes in production he himself inaugurates. 

We calI the present day Dland the day the equilibrium will be 


70~ Human Action 
established D,. Accordingly we name the following magnitudes cor- 
responding to these two days: the scale of valuation of the goods of 
the first order VIand V,; the total supply of all original factors of 
production O1 and On,the total supply of all produced factors of 

production P1 and P,, and summarize O1+P, as MI and On+P, 
as M,. Finally we call the state of technological knowledge T1 and 
T,. For the solution of the equations a knowledge of V,, On+P, = 
M,, and Tnis required. But what we know today is merely V1, Of + 

P1 =MI,and TI. 

It wouId be impermissible to assume that these magnitudes for Dl 
are equal to those for Dn because the state of equilibrium cannot be 
attained if further changes in the data occur. The absence of further 
changes in the data which is the condition required for the establish- 
ment of equilibrium refers only to such changes as could derange the 
adjustment of conditions to the operation of those elements which are 
already operating today. The system cannot attain the state of equilib- 
rium if new elements, penetrating from without, divert it from those 
movements which tend toward the establishment of equilibrium.1° 
But as long as the equilibrium is not yet attained, the system is in a 
continuous movement which changes the data. The tendency toward 
the establishment of equilibrium, not interrupted by the emergence of 
any changes in the data coming from without, is in itself a succession 
of changes in the data. 

Pi is a set of magnitudes that do not correspond to today's valua- 
tions. It is the outcome of actions which were guided by past valuations 
and faced a state of technological knowledge and of information 
about available resources of primary factors of production which 
was different from the present state. One of the reasons why the 
system is not in equilibrium is precisely the fact that PI is not adjusted 
to present conditions. There are plants, tools, and supplies of other 
factors of production which would not exist under equilibriun~, and 
other plants, tools, and supplies must be produced in order to establish 
equiiibrium. Equiiibrium wiii emerge oniy when these disturbing 
parts of PI, as far as they are still utilizable, will be worn out and 
replaced by items which correspond to the state of the other 
synchronous data, viz., V, 0,and T. What acting man needs to know 
is not the state of affairs under equilibrium, but information about 

9. Supply means a total inventory in which the whole supply available is speci- 
fied in classes and quantities. Each class comprehends only such items as have in 
any regard (for instance, aIso in regard to their location) precisely the same im- 
portance for want-satisfaction. 
10.Of course, we may assume that TIis equal to T,if wc are prepared to im-
ply that technological knowledge has reached its final stage.

the rnost appropriate method of transforming, by successive steps, P, 
into P,. With regard to this task the equations are useless. 

One cannot master these problems by eliminating P and relying 
only upon 0.It is true that the mode of utilizing the original factors 
of production uniquely determines the quality and quantity of the 
produced factors of production, the intermediary products. But the 
information that could be won in this way refers only to the condi- 
tions of equilibrium. It does not tell us anything about the methods 
and procedures to be resorted to for the realization of equilibrium. 
Today we are confronted with a supply of PI which differs from 
the state of equilibrium. We must take into account real conditions, 
i.e., P,, and not the hypothetical conditions of P,,. 

This hypothetical future state of equilibrium will appear when all 
methods of production have been adjusted to the valuations of the 
actors and to the state of technological knowledge. Then one will 
work in the most appropriate locations with the most adequate techno- 
logical methods. Today's economy is different. It operates with other 
means which do not correspond to the equilibrium state and cannot 
be taken into account in a system of equations describing this state 
in mathematical symbols. The knowledge of conditions which will 
prevail under equilibrium is useless for the director whose task it is 
to act today under present conditions. What he must learn is how to 
proceed in the rnost economical way with the means available today 
which are the inheritance of an age with different valuations, a differ- 
ent technological knowledge, and diffcrent information about prob- 
lems of location. He mast know which step is the next he must ~nake. 
In this dilemma the equations provide no help. 

Let us assume that an isolated country whose economic conditions 

are those of Central Europe in the middle of the nineteenth century is 

ruled by a director who is perfectly familiar with the American tech- 

nology of our day. This director knows by and large to what goaI he 

should lead the economy of the country entrusted to his care. Yet 

even a full knowledge of today's American conditions could not be of 

use to him in regard to the problem of transforming by successive 

steps, in the most appropriate and expedient way, the given cconomic 

system into the system aimed at. 

Even if, for the sake of argument, we assume that a tniraculous in- 

spiration has enabled the director without economic calculation to 

solve all problems concerning the most advantageous arrangement of 

a11 production activities and that the precise image of the final goal 

he must aim at is present to his mind, there remain essential problems 

which cannot be dealt with without cconomic calculation. For the 


Human Action 

director's task is not to begin from the very bottom of civilization and 
to start economic history from scratch. The clcmcnts with the aid 
of which he must operate are not only natural resources untouched 
by previous utilization. There are also the capital goods produccd in 
the past and not convertiblc or not perfectly convertible for new 
projects. It is in precisely these artifacts, produced under a constella- 
tion in which valuations, technological know-ledge, and many other 
things were different from what they are today, that our wealth 
is embodicd. Their structure, quality, quantity, and location is of 
primary i~nportance in the choice of all further economic operations. 
Some of them may be absolutely useless for any furthcr employment; 
they must remain "unused capacity." But the greater part of thcm 
must be utilized if we do not want to start anew from the extreme 
poverty and destitution of primitive man and want to survive the 
pcriod which separates us from the day on which the reconstruction 
of the apparatus of production according to the new plans will be 
accomplished. The director cannot merely erect a new construction 
without bothering about his wards' fate in the waiting pcriod. He 
r~lust try to take advantage of cvery piece of the already availablc 
capital goods iq thc best possible way. 

Not only the technocrats, but socialists of all shades of opinion, 
repeat again and again that what makes thc achicvemcnt of their 
ambitious plans realizable is the enormous wealth hitherto ac-
cumulated. But in the same breath they disregard the fact that 
this wealth consists to a great extent in capital goods produced in 
the past and more or less antiquated from the point of view of 
our present valuations and technological knowledge. As they see 
it, the only aim of production is to transform the industrial ap- 
paratus in such a way as to make life more abundant for later 
generations. In their eyes contemporaries are simply a lost gencration, 
people whose onIy purpose it must be to toil and trouble for the 
benefit of the unborn. Howevcr, real men are different. They want 

"A+ t t A tt 1 . + . * 1 : -I_---

themselves also want to enjoy life. They want to utilize in the most 
efficient way those capital goods which arc now available. They aim 
at a better future, but they want to attain this goal in the most eco- 
nomical way. For thc realization of this desire too they cannot do with- 
out economic calculation. 

It was a serious mistake to belicve that the state of equilibrium 
could be computed, by means of mathematical opcrations, on the 
basis of the knowledge of conditions in a noncquilibrium state. It was 
no Iess erroneous to beIieve that such a knowledge of the conditions 


Economic Calculation under Socialism 


under a hypothetical state of equilibrium could be of any use for 
acting man in his search for the best possible solution of the problems 
with which he is faced in his daily choices and activities. There is 
therefore no need to stress the point that the fabulous number of 
equations which one would have to solve each day anew for a prac-
tical utilization of the method would make the whole idea absurd even 
if it were realIy a reasonable substitute for the market's economic 
cal~ulation.~~

The Hampered Market Economy 

XXVII. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MARKET 
I. The Idea of a Third System 
P 
P
RIVATE ownership of the means of production (market economy 
or capitalism) and public ownership of the means of production 
(socialism or communism or "planning") can be neatly distinguished. 
Each of these two systems of society's econonlic organization is open 
to a precise and unambiguous description and definition. They can 
never be confounded with one another; they cannot be mixid or 
combined; no gradual transition leads from one of thcm to the other; 
their obversion is contradictory. With regard to the same factors of 
production there can only exist private control or public control. If in 
the frame of a system of social cooperation only some means of pro- 
duction are subject to public ownership while the rest are controlled 
by privatc individuals, this does not make for a mixed system combin- 
ing socialism and private ownership. The system remains a market 
society, provided the socialized sector does not become entirely 
separated from the non-socialized sector and Iead a strictly autarkic 
existence. (In this latter case there are two systems independently 
coexisting side by side-a capitalist and a socialist.) Publicly owned 
enterprises, operating within a system in which there are privatcly 
owned enterprises and a market, and socialized countries, exchanging 
goods and services with nonsocialist countries, are integrated into a 
system of market economy. They are subject to the law of the market 
and have the opportunity of resorting to economic cal~ulation.~ 

If one considers the idea of placing by the side of these two systems 
or between them a third system of liiiman cooperation urider the 
division of labor, one can always start only from the notion of the 
market economy, never from that of socialism. The notion of socialism 
with its rigid monism and centralism that vests the power to choose 
and to act in one will exclusively does not allow of any compromise 
or concession; this construction is not amenable to any adjustment 
or alteration. But it is different with the scheme of the market econ- 
omy. Here the dualism of the market and the government's power of 
coercion and compulsion suggests various ideas. Is it really peremptory 

I. See above, pp. 259-260. 

The Government and the Market 

77.3 

or expedient, people ask, that the government keep itself out of the 
market? Should it not be a task of government to interfere and to 
correct the opcration of the market? Is it necessary to put up with 
the alternative of capitalism os socialism? Are there not perhaps still 
other realizable systems of social organization which are neither com- 
munism nor pure and unhampered market economy? 

Thus people have contrived a variety of third solutions, of systems 
which, it is claimed, are as far from socialism as they are from capital- 
ism. Their authors allege that these systems are nonsocialist because 
they aim to preserve private ownership of the means of production and 
that they are not capitalistic because they eliminate the "deficiencies" 
of the market economy. For a scientific treatment of the problems in- 
volved which by necessity is neutral with regard to all value judg-
ments and thcrcfore does not condemn any features of capitalism as 
faulty, detrimental, or unjust, this emotional rccommcndation of 
interventionism is of no avail. The task of economics is to analyze and 
to search for truth. It is not called upon to praise or to disapprove from 
any standard of preconceived postulates and prejudices. With regard 
to interventionism it has only one question to ask and to answer: 
How does it work? 

2. The Intervention 
There are two patterns for the realization of socialism. 

The first pattern (we may call it the Lenin or the Russian pattern) 

is purely bureaucratic. All pIants, shops, and farms are formally na- 

tionalized (verstmtlicht); they are departments of the gover&ent 

operated by civil servants. Every unit of the apparatus of production 

stands in the same relation to the superior central organization as does 

a post office to the office of the postmaster general. 

The second pattern (we may calI it the Hindenburg or German 

pattern) nominally and seemingly preserves private ownership of 

the means of production and keeps the appearance of ordinary 

markets, prices, wages, and interest rates. There are, however, no 

longer entrepreneurs, but only shop managers (Betriebsfiih~er in the 

terminology of the Nazi legislation). These shop managers are seem- 

ingly instrumental in the conduct of the enterprises entrusted to them; 

they buy and sell, hire and discharge workers and remunerate their 

services, contract debts and pay interest and amortization. But in all 

their activities they are bound to obey unconditionally the orders 

issued by the government's supreme office of production management. 

This office (the Reichswirtschaf tsministerim in Nx~i Germany) tells 


Human Action 

the shop managers what and how to produce, at what prices and from 
whom to buy, at what prices and to whom to sell. It assigns every 
worker to his job and fixes his wages. It decrees to whom and on 
what terms the capitalists must entrust their funds. Market exchange 
is merely a sham. AIl the wages, prices, and interest rates are fixed by 
the government; they are wages, prices, and interest rates in appear- 
ance only; in fact they are merely quantitative terms in the govern- 
ment's orders determining each citizen's job, income, consumption, 
and standard of living. The government directs all production activi- 
ties. The shop managers are subject to the government, not to the 
consumers' demand and the market's price structure. This is socialism 
under the outward guise of the terminology of capitalism. Some labels 
of the capitalistic market economy are retained, but they signify 
something entirely different from what they mean in the market 
economy. 

It is necessary to point out this fact in order to prevent a confusion 
of socialism and interventionism. The system of interventionism or of 
the hampered market economy differs from the German pattern of 
socialism by the very fact that it is still a market economy. The author- 
ity interferes with the operation of the market economy, but does not 
want to eliminate the market altogether. It wants production and 
consumption to develop aIong lines different from those prescribed 
by an unhampered market, and it wants to achieve its aim by injecting 
into the working of the market orders, commands, and prohibitions 
for whose enforcement the police power and its apparatus of violent 
compulsion and coercion stand ready. But these are isolated acts of 
intervention. It is not the aim of the government to combine them into 
an integrated system which determines all prices, wages and interest 
rates and thus places full control of production and consumption into 
the hands of the authorities. 

The system of the hampered market economy or interventionism 
aims at preserving the dualism of the distinct spheres of government 
acdvities en the one hand am! ecenemic freedem uxdcr the mzrket 
system on the other hand. What characterizes it as such is the fact 
that the government does not limit its activities to the preservation of 
private ownership of the means of production and its protection 
against violent encroachments. The government interferes with the 
operation of business by means of orders and prohibitions. 

The intervention is a decree issued, directly or indirectly, by the 
authority in charge of the administrative apparatus of coercion and 
compulsion which forces the entrepreneurs and capitalists to employ 
some of the factors of production in a way different from what they 


The Government and the Market 

715 

would have resorted to if they were only obeying the dictates of the 
market. Such a decree can be either an order to do something or an 
order not to do something. It is not required that the decree be issued 
directly by the established and generally recognized authority itself. 
It may happen that some other agencies arrogate to themselves the 
power to issue such orders or prohibitions and to enforce them by an 
apparatus of violent coercion and oppression of their own. If the 
recognized government tolerates such procedures or even supports 
them by the employment of its governmental police apparatus, mat- 
ters stand as if the government itself had acted. If the government 
is opposed to other agencies' violent action, but does not succecd in 
suppressing it by means of its own armed forces, although it wouId 
like to suppress it, anarchy results. 

It is important to remember that government interference always 
means either violent action or the threat of such action. Government 
is in the last resort the employment of armed men, of policemen, 
gendarmes, soldiers, prison guards, and hangmen. The essential feature 
of government is the enforcement of its decrees by beating, killing, 
and imprisoning. Those who are asking for more government inter- 
ference are asking ultimately for more compulsion and less freedom. 

To draw attention to this fact does not imply any reflection upon 
government activities. In stark reality, peaceful social cooperation is 
impossible if no provision is made for violent prevention and suppres- 
sion of antisocial action on the part of refractory individuals and 
groups of individuals. One must take exception to the often repeated 
phrase that government is an evil, although a necessary and indispen- 
sable evil. What is required for the attainment of an end aimed at is 
a means, the cost to be expended for its successful realization. It is an 
arbitrary value judgment to describe it as an evil in the moral conno- 
tation of the term. However, in face of the modern tendencies toward 
a deification of government and state, it is good to remind ourselves 
that the old Romans were more realistic in symbolizing the state by 
a bundle of rods with an ax in the middle than are our contemporaries 
in ascribing to the state all the attributes of God. 

3. The Delimitation of Governmental Functions 
Various schools of thought parading under the pompous names of 
philosophy of law and political science indulge in futile and empty 
brooding over the delimitation of the functions of government. Start- 
ing from purely arbitrary assumptions concerning allegedly eternal 
and absolute values and perennial justice, they arrogate to themselves 


716 Human Action 

the office of the supreme judge of earthIy affairs. They misconstrue 
their own arbitrary value judgments derived from intuition as the 
voice of the Almighty or the nature of things. 

There is, however, no such thing as natural law and a perennial 
standard of what is just and what is unjust. Nature is alien to the idea 
of right and wrong. "Thou shalt not kill" is certainly not part of 
natural law. The characteristic feature of natural conditions is that 
one animal is intent upon killing other animals and that many species 
cannot preserve their own life except by killing others. The notion of 
right and wrong is a human device, a utilitarian precept designed to 
make social cooperation under the division of labor possible. All moral 
rules and human laws are means for the realization of definite ends. 
There is no method available for the appreciation of their goodness or 
badness other than to scrutinize their usefulness for the attainment of 
the ends chosen and aimed at. 

From the notion of natural law some people deduce the justice of 
the institution of private property in the means of production. Other 
people resort to natural law for the justification of the abolition of 
private property in the means of production. As the idea of natural 
law is quite arbitrary, such discussions are not open to settlement. 

State and government are not ends, but means. Inflicting evil upon 
other people is a source of direct pleasure only to sadists. Established 
authorities resort to coercion and compulsion in order to safeguard 
the smooth operation of a definite system of social organization. The 
sphere in which coercion and compulsion is applied and the content 
of the laws which are to be enforced by the police apparatus arc con- 
ditioned by the social order adopted. As state and government are 
designed to make this social system operate safely, the delimitation of 
governmental functions must be adjusted to its requirements. The 
only standard for the appreciation of the laws and the methods for 
their enforcement is whether or not they are emcicnt in safeguarding 
the social order which it is desired to prcscrve.

system of norms which in itself is assumed to be uncontested and 
safe against any criticism. Many peoples have clung to the doctrine 
that what is right and what is wrong is established from the dawn of the 
remotest ages and for eternity. The task of legislators and courts was 
not to make the laws, but to find out what is right by virtue of the 
unchanging idea of justice. This doctrine, which resulted in an 
adamant conservatism and a petrification of old customs and jnstitu- 
tions, was challenged by the doctrine of natural right. To the positive 
laws of the country the notion of a "higher" law, the law of nature, 


The Go,vernnzent and the Market 7'7 

was opposed. From the arbitrary standard of natural law the valid 
statutes and institutions were called just or unjust. To the good legisla- 
tor was assigned the task of making the positive laws agree with the 
natural law. 

The fundamental errors involved in these two doctrines havc long 
since bccn unmasked. For those not deluded by them it is obvious 
that the appeal to justice in a debate concerning the drafting of new 
laws is an instance of circular reasoning. Ile lege ferenda there is no 
such a thing as justice. The notion of justice can logicaIly onIy be 
resorted to de lege lata. It makes sense only when approving or dis- 
approving concrcte conduct from thc point of view of the valid laws 
of the country. In considering changes in the nation's legal system, in 
rewriting or repealing existing law and writing new laws, the issue is 
not justice, but social expediency and social wclfarc. Therc is no such 
thing as an absolute notion of justicc not referring to a definite system 
of social organization. It is not justice that determines the decision in 
favor of a definite socia1 system. It is, on the contrary, the social 
system which detcrmines what should be deemed right and what 
wrong. Thcrc is neither right nor wrong outside the social ncxus. For 
the hypothetical isolated and self-sufficient individual the notions of 
just and unjust arc cmpty. Such an individual can merely distinguish 
between what is more expedient and what is less expedient for himseIf. 
The idea of justice refers always to socia1 cooperation. 

It is nonsensical to justify or to reject interventionism from the 
point of view of a fictitious and arbitrary idea of absolute justice. It 
is vain to ponder over the just delimitation of the tasks of government 
from any preconceived standard of perennial values. It is no less im- 
permissible to deduce the proper tasks of govcrnment from the very 
notions of government, state, law and justice. It was precisely this that 
was absurd in the speculations of medieval scholasticism, of Fichte, 
Schelling, and Hegel, and of German Con-

Begrifl'sjz~~ispn~denz. 

ceprs are tools of reasoning. They must never he considered as rep- 

lative principlcs dictating modes of conduct. 

It is a display of supererogatory mental gymnastics to emphasize 

that the notions of state and sovereignty logically imply absolute 

supremacy and thus preclude the idea of any limitations on the state's 

activities. Xobody questions the fact that a state has the power to 

establish totalitarianism within the territory in which it is sovereign. 

The problem is whether or not such a mode of government is ex- 

pedient from the point of view of the preservation and functioning 

of social cooperation. With regard to this problem no sophisti-

cated exegesis of concepts and notions can be of any use. It must be 


Human Action 

decided by praxeology, not by a spurious n~etaphysics of state and 
right. 

The philosophy of law and political science arc at a loss to discover 
any reason why government should not control prices and not punish 
those defying the price ceilings decreed, in the same way as it punishes 
murderers and thieves. As they see it, the institution of private 
property is merely a revocable favor graciously granted by the al- 
mighty sovereign to the wretched individuals. There cannot be any 
wrong in repealing totally or partially the laws that granted this favor; 
no reasonable objection can be raised against cxpropriation and con- 
fiscation. The legislator is free to substitute any social system for that 
of the private ownership of the means of production, just as he is 
free to substitute another national anthem for that adopted in the 
past. The formula car tcl est notre bun plaisir is the only maxim of 
the sovereign lawgiver's conduct. 

As against all this formalism and legal dogmatism, there is need to 
emphasize again that the only purpose of the laws and the social ap- 
paratus of coercion and compulsion is to safeguard the smooth func- 
tioning of social cooperation. It js obvious that the government has the 
power to decree maximum prices and to imprison or to execute those 
selling or buying at a higher price. But the question is whcther such a 
policy can or cannot attain the ends which the government wants 
to attain by resorting to it. This is a purely praxeological and economic 
problem. Seither the philosophy of law nor political science can con- 
tribute anything to its solution. 

The problem of interventionism is not a problcm of the correct 

delimitation of the "natural," "just," and "adequate" tasks of state 

and government. The issue is: How does a system of interventionism 

work? Can it realize those ends which people, in resorting to it, want 

to attain? 

The confusion and lack of judgment displayed in dealing with the 

problems of interventionism are amazing indeed. There are, for in- 

stance, peopie who argue thus: it is obvious that traffic reguiations on 

the public roads are necessary. Nobody objects to the government's 

interference with the car driver's conduct. The advocates of laissez 

fairc contradict themselves in fighting government interference with 

market priccs and yet not advocating the abolition of government 

traffic regulation. 

The fallacy of this argument is manifest. The regulation of traffic 

on a road is one of the tasks incumbent upon the agency that operates 

the road. If this agency is the government or the municipality, it is 

bound to attend to this task. It is the task of a railroad's management 


The Goz~ernment and the Market 

719 

to fix the timetable of the trains and it is the task of a hotel's nianage- 
ment to decide whether or not there should be music in the dining 
room. If the government operates a railroad or a hotel, it is the govern- 
ment's task to regulate these things. It is not an instance of government 
interference with the operation of the market economy that the post- 
master general chooses the pattern and the color of the postage stamps. 
With a state opera the government decides which operas should be 
produced and which not; it is a non sequitur to deduce from this fact 
that it is also a task of the government to decide these things for a 
nongovernmental opera. 

4. Righteousness as the Ultimate Standard of the Irzdividual's 
Actions 
According to a widespread opinion it is possible, even in the absence 
of government interference with business, co divert the operation of 
the market economy from those lines aloncr which it would develop 
if left to exclusive control by the ~rofit motive. Advocates of a social 
reform to be accomplished by compliance with the principles of 
Christianity or with the demands of "true" morality maintain that 
conscience should also guide well-intentioned people in their dealings 
oh the market. If a11 peopIe were prepared not only to concern them- 
selves selfishly about profit, but no less about thcir religious and moral 
obligations, no government compulsion and coercion would be re- 
quired in order to put things right. What is needed is not a reform 
of government and the laws of the country, but the moral purification 
of man, a return to the Lord's commandments and to the precepts of 
the moral code, a turning away from the vices of greed and selfishness. 
Then it wilI be easy to reconcile private ownership of the means of 
production with justice, righteousness, and fairness. The disastrous 
effects of capitalism will be eliminated without prejudice to the indi- 
vidnal's freedom and initiative. People will dethrone the Moloch 
capitalism without enthroning the Moloch state. 

The arbitrary value judgments which arc at the bottom of these 

opinions need not concern us here. What these critics blame capitalism 

for is irrelevant; their errors and fallacies are beside the point. What 

does matter is the idea of erecting a social system on the twofold 

basis of private property and of moral principles restricting the utiliza- 

tion of private property. The system recommended. say its advocates, 

wilI be neither socialism nor capitalism nor intervdntionisrn. Not 

socialism, because it will preserve private ownership of the means of 

production; not capitalism, because conscience will be supreme and 


Hz~manAction 

not the urge for profit; not interventionism, because there will be 
no need for government interference with the market. 

In the market economy the individual is free to act within the 
orbit of private property and the market. His choices are final. For 
his fellow men his actions are data which they must take into account 
in their own acting. The coordination of the autonomous actions of 
all individuals is accomplished by the operation of the market. Society 
does not tell a man what to do and what not to do. There is no need 
to enforce cooperation by special orders or prohibitions. Noncoop- 
eration penalizes itself. Adjustment to the requirements of society's 
productive effort and the pursuit of the individual's own concerns are 
not in conflict. Consequently no agency is required to settle such 
conflicts. The system can work and accomplish its tasks without thc 
interference of an authority issuing special orders and prohibitions 
and punishing those who do not comply. 

Beyond the sphere of private property and the market lies the 
sphere of compulsion and coercion; here are the dams which orgmized 
society has built for the protection of private property and the market 
against violence, malice, and fraud. This is the realm of constraint as 
distinguished from the realm of freedom. Here are rulcs discriminating 
between what is legal and what is illegal, what is permitted and what is 
prohibitcd. And here is a grim machine of arms, prisons, and gallows 
and the men operating it, ready to crush those who dare to disobey. 

Now, the reformers with whose plans we are concerned suggest 
that along with the norms designed for the protcction and preserva- 
tion of private property further ethical rules should be ordained. They 
want to realize in production and consumption things other than those 
realized under the social order in which the individuals are not 
checked by any obligation other than that of not infringing upon the 
persons of their fellow men and upon the right of private property. 
They want to ban those motives that direct the individual's action in 
the market economy (they call them selfishness, acquisitiveness, 
profit-seekingj and to repiace them with other impuises (they caii 
them conscientiousness, righteousness, altruism, fear of God, charity). 
They are convinced that such a moral reform would in itself be suffi- 
cient to safeguard a mode of operation of the economic system, more 
satisfactory from their point of view than that of unhampered capital- 
ism, without any of those special governmental measures which inter- 
ventionism and socialism require. 

The supporters of these doctrines fail to recognize the role which 

those springs of action they condemn as vicious play in the operation 

of the market economy. The only reason why the market economy 


The Government and the Market 

can operate without government orders telling everybody precisely 
what he should do and how he should do it is that it does not ask any- 
body to deviate from those lines of conduct which best serve his own 
interests. What integrates the individual's actions into the whole of 
the socia1 system of production is the pursuit of his own purposes. 
In indulging in his "acquisitiveness" each actor contributes his share 
to the best possible arrangement of production activities. Thus, within 
the sphere of private property and the laws protecting it against en- 
croachments on the part of violent or fraudulent action, there is no 
antagonism between the interests of the individual and those of 
society. 

The market economy becomes a chaotic muddle if this predom- 
inance of private property which the reformers disparage as selfish- 
ness is eliminated. In urging peoplc to listen to the voice of their con- 
science and to substitute considerations of public welfare for those 
of private profit, one does not create a working and satisfactory social 
order. It is not enough to tell a man not to buy on the cheapest market 
and not to sell on the dearest market. It is not enough to tell hiin not 
to strive after profit and not to avoid losses. One must estabIish un- 
ambiguous rules for the guidance of conduct in each concrete situa- 
tion. 

Says the reformer: The entrepreneur is rugged and selfish when, 
taking advantage of his own superiority, he underbids the prices asked 
by a less efficient competitor and this forces the man to go out of 
business. But how should the "altruistic" entrepreneur proceed? 
Should he under no circumstances sell at a price lower than any com- 
petitor? Or are there certain conditions which justify underbidding 
the competitor's prices? 

Says the reformer on the other hand: The entrepreneur is rugged 
and selfish when, taking advantage of the structure of the market, he 
asks a price so high that poor peoplc are excluded from purchasing the 
merchandise. But what should the "good" entrepreneur do? Should 
he give away the merchandise free of charge? If he charges any price, 
however low, there will always be peoplc who cannot buy at all or 
not so much as they would buy if the price were still lower. What 
group of those eager to buy is the entrepreneur free to exclude from 
getting the merchandise? 

There is no need to deal at this point of our investigation with the 
consequences resulting from any deviation from the height of prices 
as determined on an unhampered market. If the seller avoids undcr- 
bidding his less efficient competitor, a part at least of his supply re- 
mains unsold. If the seller offers the merchandise at a price lower than 


Human Action 

that determined on an unhampered market, the supply available is 
insufficient to enable all those ready to expend this lower price to get 
what they are asking for. We will analyze later these as well as other 
consequences of any deviation from the market prices.What we must 
recognize even at this point is that one cannot content oneself simply 
by telling the entrepreneur that he should not let himself be guided 
by the state of the market. It is imperative to tell him how far he must 
go in asking and paying prices. If it is no longer profit-seeking that 
directs the entrepreneurs' actions and determines what they produce 
and in what quantities, if the entrepreneurs are no longer bound by 
the instrumentality of the profit motive to serve the consumers to 
the best of their abilities, it is necessary to give them definite instruc- 
tions. One cannot avoid guiding their conduct by specified orders and 
prohibitions, precisely such decrees as are the mark of government 
interference with business. Any attempt to render such interference 
supertluous by attributing primacy to the voice of conscience, to 
charity and brotherly love, is vain. 

The advocates of a Christian social reform pretend that their ideal 
of greed and profit-seeking tamed and restrained by conscientiousness 
and compliance with the moral law worked rather well in the past. 
All the evils of our day are caused by defection from the precepts 
of the church. If people had not defied the commandments and had 
not coveted unjust profit, mankind would stiIl enjoy the bliss ex-
perienced in the Middle Ages when at least the elite lived up to the 
principles of the Gospels. What is needed is to bring back those good 
old days and then to see that no new apostasy deprives men of their 
beneficent effects. 

There is no need to enter into an analysis of the social and economic 
conditions of the thirteenth century which these reformers praise 
as the greatest of all periods of history. We are concerned merely with 
the notion of just prices and wage rates which was essential in the 
social teachings of the doctors of the church and which the reformers 
want to ralse to the position of the ultimate standard of economic 
conduct. 

It is obvious that with theorists this notion of just prices and wage 
rates always refers and always referred to a definite social order which 
they considered the best possible order. They recommend the adop- 
tion of their ideal scheme and its preservation forever. No further 
changes are to be tolerated. Any alteration of the best possible state 
of social affairs can only mean deterioration. The world view of these 
philosophers does not take into account man's ceaseless striving for 

2. See below, pp. 752-761. 

The Governwzent and the Market 

improvement of the material conditions of well-being. Historical 
change and a rise in the general standard of living are notions foreign 
to them. They calI "just" that mode of conduct that is compatible 
with the undisturbed preservation of their utopia, and everything 
else unjust. 

However, the notion of just prices and wage rates as present to the 
mind of people other than philosophers is very different. When the 
nonphilosopher calls a price just, what he means is that the preserva- 
tion of this price improves or at least does not impair his own revenues 
and station in society. He calls unjust any price that jeopardizes his 
own wealth and station. It is "just" that the prices of those goods and 
services which he sells rise more and more and that the prices of those 
goods and services he buys drop more and more. To the farmer no 
price of wheat, howevcr high, appears unjust. To the wage earner no 
wage rates, however high, appear unfair. But the farmer is quick to 
denounce every drop in the price of wheat as a violation of divine 
and human laws, and the wage earners rise in rebellion when their 
wages drop. Yet the market society has no means of adjusting produc- 
tion to changing conditions other than the operation of the market. 
By means of price changes it forces people to restrict the production 
of articles less urgently asked for and to expand the production of 
those articles for which consumers' demand is more urgent. The 
absurdity of a11 endeavors to stabilize prices consists precisely in the 
fact that stabilization would prevent any further improvement and re- 
sult in rigidity and stagnation. The flexibility of commodity prices and 
wage rates is the vehicle of adjustment, improveme~t, and progress. 
Those who condemn changes in prices and wage rates as unjust, and 
who ask for the preservation of what they call just, are in fact com- 
bating endeavors to make economic conditions more satisfactory. 

It is not unjust that there has long prevailed a tendency toward such 
a determination of the prices of agricultural products that the greater 
part of the population abandoned farming and moved toward the 
processing industries. But for this tendency, 90 per cent or more of 
the population would still be occupied in airiculture and the process- 
ing industries would have been stunted in their growth. All strata of 
the population, including the farmers, would be worse off. If Thomas 
Aquinas' doctrine of the just price had been put into practice, the 
thirteenth century's economic conditions would still prevail. Popula- 
tion figures would be much smaller than they are today and the 
standard of living much lower. 

Both varicties of the just-price doctrine, the philosophical and the 
popular, agree in their condemnation of the prices and wage rates as 


Human Action 

determined on the unhampered market. But this negativism does not 
in itself provide any answer to the question of what height the just 
prices and wage rates should attain. If righteousness is to be elevated to 
the position of the ultimate standard of economic action, one must 
unambiguously tell every actor what he should do, what prices he 
should ask, and what prices he should pay in each concrete case, and 
one must force-by recourse to an apparatus of violcnt compulsion 
and coercion-all those venturing disobedience to comply with these 
orders. One must establish a supreme authority issuing norms and 
regulating conduct in every respect, altcring these norms if need be, 
interpreting them authentically, and enforcing them. Thus the substi- 
tution of social justice and righteousness for selfish profit-seeking re- 
quires for its realization preciscly those policies of government inter- 
ference with business which the advocates of the moral purification 
of mankind want to ~nake superfluous. No deviation from the un- 
hampered market economy is thinkable without authoritarian rcgi- 
mentation. U7hether the authority in which these powcrs are vested is 
called lay government or theocratical priesthood makes no diffcrcnce. 

The reformers, in exhorting people to turn away from selfishness, 
address themselves to capitalists and entrepreneurs, and sometimes, al- 
though only timidly, to wage earners as well. Ilowcvcr, the market 
economy is a system of consumers' supremacy. The sermonizers 
should appeal to consumers, not to producers. They should persuade 
the consumers to renounce preferring better and cheaper merchandise 
to poorer and dearer merchandise lest they hurt the less efficient pro- 
ducer. They should persuade them to restrict their own purchases 
in order to provide poorcr people with the opportunity to buy more. 
If one wants the consumers to act in this way, one must tell them 
plainly what to buy, in what quantity, from whom, and at what prices; 
and one must provide for cnforcing such orders by coercion and coin- 
pulsion. But thcn one has adopted exactly that system of authoritarian 
control which moral reform wants to make unnecessary. 

U7hatever freedom individuals can enjoy within the framework 
of social cooperation is conditional upon the concord of private gain 
and public weal. Within the orbit in which the individual, in pursu- 
ing his own well-being, advances also-or at least does not impair-the 
well-being of his fellow men, people going their own ways jeopardize 
neither the preservation of society nor the concerns of other peoplc. 
A realm of freedom and individuaI initiative emerges, a realm in which 
man is allowed to choose and to act of his own accord. This sphere of 
economic freedom is the basis of all the other freedoms cornpatibIe 
with cooperation under the division of labor. It is the market economy 


The Government and the Market 

or capitalism with its political corollary (the Marxians would have to 
say: with its "superstructure"), representative government. 

Those who contend that there is a conflict between the acquisitive- 
ness of various individuals or between the acquisitiveness of individ- 
uaIs on the one hand and the commonweal on the other, cannot avoid 
advocating the suppression of the individuals' right to choose and to 
act. They must substitute the supremacy of a central board of pro- 
duction management for the discretion of the citizens. In their scheme 
of the good society there is no room left for private initiative. The 
authority issues orders and everybody is forced to obey. 

5. The Meaning of Laissez Faire 
In eighteenth-century France the saying laissez faire, laissez 
passer was the formula into which some of the champions of the 
cause of liberty compressed their program. Their aim was the estab- 
lishment of the unhampered market society. In order to attain this end 
they advocated the abolition of all Iaws preventing more industrious 
and more efficient people from outdoing less industrious and less 
efficient competitors and restricting the mobility of commodities and 
of men. It was this that the famous maxim was designed to express. 

In our age of passionate longing for government onlnipotence the 
formula laissez faire is in disrepute. Public opinion now considers it 
a manifestation both of moral depravity and of the utmost ignorance. 

As the interventionist sees things, the alternative is "automatic 
forces7' or "conscious planning." It is obvious, he implies, that to 
rely upon automatic processes is sheer stupidity. No reasonable man 
can seriously rccornmend doing nothing and letting things go as they 
do without interference on the part of purposive action. A plan, by 
the very fact that it is a display of conscious action, is incomparably 
superior to the absence of any planning. Laissez faire is said to mean: 
Let the evils last, do not try to improve the lot of mankind by reason- 
able action. 

This is utterly falIacious talk. The argument advanced for planning 
is entirely derived from an impermissible interpretation of a Ineta- 
phor. It has no foundation other than the connotations implied in 
the term "automatic" which it is customary to apply in a metaphorical 
sense for the description of the market proces~.~ 

Automatic, says the 
Concise Oxford Dictionar~,~means "unconsciom, unintelligent, 

3. Cf. A. H. Hansen, "Social Planning for Tomorrou7," in The United States 
after the War (Cornell University Lectures, Ithaca, 1945),pp. 32-33. 
4. See above, pp. 311-312. 
5. (3d ed. Oxford, 19341,p. 74. 

Human Action 
merely mechanical." Automatic, says Webster's Collegiate Diction- 
ary,"eans "not subject to the control of the will, . . . performed 
without active thought and without conscious intention or direction." 
What a triumph for the champion of planning to play this trump card! 
The truth is that the alternative is not benveen a dead mechanism 
or a rigid automatism on one hand and conscious planning on the 
other hand. The alternative is not plan or no plan. The question is 
whose planning? Should each member of society plan for himself, 
or should a benevolent government alone plan for them all? The 
issue is not automatisnr versus conscious action; it is autonomous 
action of each individual versus the exclusive action of the govern- 
ment. It is freedom versus government omnipotence. 
Laissez faire does not mean: Let soulless mechanical forces operate. 
It means: Let each individual choose how hc wants to cooperate in 
the social division of labor; let the consumers determine what the 
entrepreneurs should produce. Planning means: Let the government 
alone choose and enforce its rulings by the apparatus of coercion and 
compulsion. 
Under laissez faire, says the planner, it is not those goods which 
people "really" need that are produced, but those goods from the 
sale of which the highest returns are expected. It is the objective of 
planning to direct production toward the satisfaction of the "true" 
needs. But who is to decide what the "true" needs are? 
Thus, for instance, Profcssor Harold Laski, the former chairman of 
the British Labor Party, would determine as the objective of the 
planned direction of investment "that the use of the investor's savings 
will be in housing rather than in cinemas." It is beside the point 
whether or not one agrees with the professor's view that better houses 
are more important than moving pictures. It is a fact that the con- 
sumers, in spending part of their money for admission to the movies, 
have made another choice. If the masses of Great Britain, the same 
people whose votes swept the Labor Party into power, were to stop 
patronizing the moving pictures and to spend more for comfortable 
homes and apartments, profit-seeking business would be forced to 
invest more in building ho~nes and apartment houses and less in the 
production of expensive pictures. It is Mr. Laski's desire to defy the 
wishes of the consumers and to substitute his own will for that of the 
consumers. He wants to do away with the democracy of the market 
and to establish the absolute rule of a production tsar. He may believe

that he is right from a "higher" point of view, and that as a superman 
he is called upon to impose his own valuations on the masses of infe- 
rior men. But then he should be frank enough to say so plainly. 

All this passionate praise of the supereminence of government action 
is but a poor disguise for the individual interventionist's self-deifica-
tion. The great god State is a great god only because it is expected to 
do exclusively what the individual advocate of interventionism wants 
to see achieved. Only that plan is genuine which the individual planner 
fully approves. All other plans are simply counterfeit. In saying "plan" 
what the author of a book on the benefits of pIanning has in mind is, 
of course, his own plan alone. He does not take into account the possi- 
bility that the plan which the governrnent puts into practice may 
differ from his own plan. The various planners agree only with regard 
to their rejection of laissez faire, i.e., the individuals' discretion to 
choose and to act. They entirely disagree with regard to the choice 
of the unique plan to be adopted. To every exposure of the manifest 
and incontestable defects of interventionist policies the champions 
of interventionism react in the same way. These faults, they say, were 
the results of spurious interventionism; what we are advocating is 
good interventionism, not bad interventionism. And, of course, good 
interventionism is the professor's own brand. 

Laissez faire means: Let the common man choose and act; do not 
force him to yield to a dictator.

6. Direct Government Interference with Consumption 
In investigating the economic problems of interventionism we do 
not have to deal with those actions of the %overnment whose aim it 
is to influence immediately the consun~er's choice of consumers' goods. 
Every act of government interference with business must indirectly af- 
fect consumption. As the government's interference alters the market 
data, it nu st also alter the valuations and the conduct of the consumers. 
But if the aim of the government is merely to force the consumers 
directly to consume goods other than what they would have consumed 
in the absence of the government's decree, no special problems emerge 
to be scrutinized by economics. It is beyond doubt that a strong and 
ruthless policc appiratus has the power to enforce such decrees. 

In dealing with the choices of the consumers we do not ask what 
motives induced a man to buy a and not to buy b. We merely investi- 
gate what effects on the determination of market prices and thereby 
on production were brought about by the concrete conduct of the 
consumers. These effects do not depend on the considerations which 


Human Action 
led individuals to buy a and not to buy b; they depend only on the 
real acts of buying and abstention from buying. It is immaterial for 
the determination of the prices of gas masks whether people buy 
them of their own accord or because the government forces every- 
body to have a gas mask. What alone counts is the size of the demand. 
Governments which are eager to keep up the outward appearance of 
freedom even when curtailing freedom disguise their direct interfer- 
ence with consumption under the cloak of interference with business. 
The aim of American prohibition was to prevent the individual resi- 
dents of the country from drinking alcoholic beverages. But the law 
hypocritically did not make drinking as such illegaI and did not penal- 
ize it. It merely prohibited the manufacture, the sale and the transpor- 
tation of intoxicating liquors, the business transactions which precede 
the act of drinking. The idea was that people indulge in the vice of 
drinking only because unscrupulous businessmen prevail upon them. 
It was, however, manifest that the objective of prohibition was to en- 
croach upon the individuals' freedom to spend their dollars and to 
enjoy their lives according to their own fashion. The restrictions im- 
posed upon business were only subservient to this ultimate end. 
The problems involved in direct government interference with 
consumption are not catallactic problems. They go far beyond the 
scope of catallactics and concern the fundamental issues of human 
life and social organization. If it is true that government derives its 
authority from God and is entrusted by Providence to act as the 
guardian of the ignorant and stupid populace, then it is certainly its 
task to regiment every aspect of the subject's conduct. The God-sent 
ruler knows better what is good for his wards than they do themselves. 
It is his duty to guard them against the harm they would inflict upon 
themselves if left alone. 
Self-styled "realistic" people fail to recognize the immense im- 
portance of the principles implied. They contend that they do not 
want to deal with the matter from what, they say, is a philosophic and 
academic p&it of view. Their approach is, they argue, exciusivciy 
guided by practical considerations. It is a fact, they say, that some 
people harm themselves and their innocent families by consuming 
narcotic drugs. Only doctrinaires could be so dogmatic as to object 
to the government's regulation of the drug traffic. Its beneficent effects 
cannot be contested. 
However, the case is not so simple as that. Opium and morphine are 
certainly dangerous, habit-forming drugs. But once the, principle is 
admitted that it is the duty of government to protect the individual 
against his own foolishness, no serious objections can be advanced 


Tbe Government and the Market 

against further encroachments. A good case could be made out in 
favor of the prohibition of alcohol and nicotine. And why limit the 
government's benevolent providence to the protection of the individ- 
ual's body only? Is not the harm a man can inflict on his mind and 
soul even more disastrous than any bodily evils? Why not prevent 
him from reading bad books and seeing bad plays, from looking at 
bad paintings and statues and from hearing bad music? The mischief 
done by bad idcologies, surely, is much more pernicious, both for 
the individual and for the whole society, than that done by narcotic 
drugs. 

These fears are not merely imaginary specters terrifying secluded 
doctrinaires. It is a fact that no paternal government, whether ancient 
or modern, ever shrank from regimenting its subjects' minds, beliefs, 
and opinions. If one abolishes man's frcedorn to determine his own 
consumption, one takes all freedoms away. The naive advocates of 
government interference with consumption delude then~selves when 
they neglect what they disdainfully call the philosophical aspect of 
the problem. They unwittingly support the case of censorship, inquisi- 
tion, religious intolerance, and the persecution of dissenters. 

In dealing with the catallactics of interventionism we do not discuss 
these political consequenccs of direct government interfcrence with 
the citizens' consumption. We are exclusively concerned with those 
acts of interference which aim at forcing the entrepreneurs and 
capitalists to employ the factors of production in a way different from 
what they would have done if they merely obeyed the dictates of the 
market. In doing this, we do not raise the question of whether such 
interference is good or bad from any preconceived point of view. We 
merely ask whether or not it can attain those ends which those advo- 
cating and resorting to it are trying to attain. 


XXVIII. INTERFERENCE BY TAXATION 
1. The Neutral Tax 
To keep the social apparatus of coercion and compulsion running 
rcquires expenditure of labor and commodities. Under a liberal 
system of government these expenditures arc small compared with 
the sum of the individuals' incomes. The more the government expands 
the sphere of its activities, the more its budget increases. 
If the government itself owns and operates plants, farms, forests, 
and mines, it might consider covering a part or the whole of its 
financial needs from interest and profit earned. But government opera- 
tion of business enterprises as a rule is so irlefficient that it results in 
losses rather than in profits. Governments must resort to taxation, i.e., 
they must raise revcnucs by forcing the subjects to surrender a part 
of their wealth or income. 
A neutral mode of taxation is conceivable that would not divert the 
operation of the market from the lines in which it would develop in 
the absence of any taxation. However, the vast literature on problems 
of taxation as well as the policies of governments have hardly ever 
given thought to the problem of the neutral tax. They have been more 
eager to find the just tax. 
The neutral tax would affect the conditions of the citizens only to 
the extent required by the fact that a part of the labor and material 
goods available is absorbed by the government apparatus. In the 
imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy the treasury 
condnimlly levies taxes and spends the whole amount raised, neither 
more nor less, for dcfraying the costs incurred by the activities of 
the government's officers. A part of each citizen's income is spent 
for public expenditure. If we assume that in such an evenly rotating 
economy there prevails perfect income equality in such a way that 
every household's income is proportional to the number of its mem- 
bers, both a head tax and a proportional income tax would be ncutral 
taxes. Under these assumptions there would be no difference between 
them. A part of each citizen's income would be absorbed by public 
expenditure, and no secondary effects of taxation would emerge. 
The changing economy is entirely different from this imaginary 


Interference by Taxation 737 

construction of an evenly rotating economy with income equality. 
Continuous change and the inequality of wealth and income are csscn- 
tial and necessary features of the changing market economy, the only 
real and working system of the market economy. In the frame of such 
a system no tax can be neutral. The very idea of a neutral tax is as 
unrealizable as that of neutral money. But, of course, the reasons for 
this inescapable non-neutrality are different in the case of taxes from 
what they are in the case of money. 

A head tax that taxes every citizen equally and uniformly without 
any regard to the size of his income and wealth, falls more heavily 
upon those with more moderate means than upon those with more 
ample means. It restricts the production of the articles consumed by 
the masses morc sharply than thar of the articles mainly consunled by 
the wealthier citizens. On the other hand, it curtails saving and capital 
accumulation less than a more burdensome taxation of the weaIthier 
citizens does. It does not slow down the tendency toward a drop in 
the ~narginal productivity of capital goods as against the marginal pro- 
ductivity of labor to the same extent as does taxation discriminating 
against those with higher income and wealth, and consequently it 
does not to the same extent retard the tendency toward a rise in wage 
rates. 

The actual fiscal policies of all countries are today exclusively 
guided by the idea that taxes should be apportioned according to 
each citizen's "ability to pay." In the considerations which finaIly 
resulted in the general acceptance of the ability-to-pay principle there 
was some dim conception that taxing the well-to-do more heavily 
than those with moderate means renders a tax somewhat morc neutral. 
However this may be, it is certain that any reference to tax neutrality 
was very soon entirely discarded. The ability-to-pay principle has 
been raised to the dignity of a postulate of social justice. As people see 
it today, the fiscal and budgetary objectives of taxation are of second- 
ary importance only. The primary function of taxation is to reform 
socia1 conditions according to justice. Taxation is a method of govern-
ment interference with business. A tax is the more satisfactory the 
less neutral it is and the more it serves as a device for diverting produc- 
tion and consumption from those lines into which the unhampered 
market would have directed them. 

2. The Total Tax 
Thc idea of social justice implied in the ability-to-pay principle 
is that of perfect financial equality of all citizens. As l.ong as any in- 


Human Action 

equality of income or wealth remains it can as plausibly be argued 
that these larger incomes and fortunes, however small their absolute 
amount, indicate some excess of ability to be levied upon, as it can be 
argued that any existing inequalities of income and weaIth indicate 
differences in ability. The only logical stopping place of the ability- 
to-pay doctrine is at the conlplete equalization of incomcs and wealth 
by confiscation of all incomes and fortunes above the lowest amount 
in the hands of anyone? 

The notion of the total tax is the antithesis of the notion of the 
neutral tax. The total tax completely taxes away-confiscates-all 
incomes and estates. Then the government, out of the community 
chest thus filled, gives to everybody an allowance for defraying the 
costs of his sustenance. Or, what comes to the same thing, the govern- 
ment in taxing leaves free that amount which it considers everybody's 
fair share and completes the shares of those \$rho have less up to the 
amount of their fair share. 

The idea of the total tax cannot be thought out to its ultimate logical 
consequences. If the cntreprencurs and capitalists do not derive any 
personal benefit or damage from their utilization of the means of 
production, they become indifferent with rcgard to the choice be- 
tween various rnodes of conduct. Their social function fades away, 
and they become disinterested irresponsible administrators of public 
property. They are no longer bound to adjust production to the 
wishes of the consumers. If only the income is taxed away while the 
capital stock itself is left free, an incentive is offered to the owners 
to consume parts of their wealth and thus to hurt the interests of 
everyone. A total income tax would be a very inept means for the 
realization of socialism. If the total tax affects wealth no less than 
income, it is no longer a tax, i.e., a device for colIecting government 
revenue within a market economy. It becomes a measure for the transi- 
tion to socialism. As soon as it is consummated, socialism has been 
substituted for capitalism. 

Even when looked upon as a method for the realization of socialism, 
the total tax is disputable. Some socialists launched plans for a proso- 
cialist tax reform. They recommended either a roo per cent estate and 
gift tax or taxing away totally the rent of land or all unearned income 
-i.e., in the socialist terminology, all revenue not derived from labor 
performed. The examination of these projects is superfluous. It is 
enough to know that they are utterly incompatible with the preserva- 
tion of the market economy.

3. Fiscal and Xonfiscal Objectives of Taxation 
The fiscal and nonfiscal objectives of taxation do not agree with 
one another. 

Consider, for instance, excise duties on liquor. If one considers them 
as a source of government revenue, the more they yield the better 
they appear. Of course, as the duty must enhance the price of the 
beverage, it restricts sales and consumption. It is necessary to find 
out by testing under what rate of duty the yield becomes highest. 
But if one looks at liquor taxes as a means of reducing the consumption 
of liquor as much as ~ossible, the rate is better the higher it is. Pushed 
beyond a certain limit, the tax makes consumption drop considerably, 
and also the revenue concomitantly. If the tax fully attains its non- 
fiscal objective of weaning people entirely from drinking alcoholic 
beverages, the revenue is zero. It no longer serves any fiscal purpose; 
its effects are merely prohibitive. The same is valid not o11ly with 
regard to all kinds of indirect taxation but no less for direct taxation. 
Discriminating taxes levied upon corporations and big business would, 
if raised above a certain limit, result in the total disappearance of 
corporations and big business. Capital levies, inheritance and estate 
taxes, and income taxes are similarly self-defeating if carried to ex- 
tremes. 

There is no solution for the irreconcilable conflict between the 

fiscal and the nonfiscal ends of taxation. The power to tax is, as Chief 

Justice Marshall pertinently observed, the power to destroy. This 

power can be used for the destruction of the market economy, and it 

is the firm resolution of many governments and parties to use it for 

this purpose. With the substitution of socialisnl for capitalism, the 

dualism of the coexistence of two distinct spheres of action disappears. 

The government swallows the whole orbit of the individuals' auton- 

omous actions and becomes totalitarian. It no longer depends for 

its financial support on the means exacted from the citizens. There is 

no longer any such thing as a separation of public funds and private 

funds. 

Taxation is a matter of the market economy. It is one of the charac- 

teristic features of the market economy that the government does not 

interfere with the market phenomena and that its technical apparatus 

is so small that its maintenance absorbs only a modest fraction of the 

total sum of the individual citizens' incomes. Then taxes are an ap- 

propriate vehicle for providing the funds needed by the government. 

They are appropriate because they are low and do not perceptibly dis- 


734 Human Action 

arrange production and consumption. If taxes grow beyond a moder- 
ate limit, they cease to be taxes and turn into devices for the destruc- 
tion of the market economy. 

This metamorphosis of taxes into weapons of dcstruction is the 
mark of prescnt-day public finance. We do not deal with the quite 
arbitrary value judgments concerning the problems of whether heavy 
taxation is a curse or a benefit and whether the expenditures financed 
by the tax yield arc or are not wise and benefi~ial.~ 

What matters is 
that the heavier taxation becomes, the lcss compatible it is with the 
preservation of the market economy. There is no need to raise the 
question of whether or not it is true that "no country was ever yet 
ruined by large expenditures of money by the public and for the 
public." "t cannot be denied that the market economy can be ruined 
by large public expenditures and that it is the intention of many people 
to ruin it in this way. 

Businessmen complain about the opprcssivcness of heavy taxes. 
Statesmen are alarmed about the danger of "eating the seedcorn." 
Yet, the true crux of the taxation issue is to be seen in the paradox that 
the more taxes increase, the more they undermine the market economy 
and concomitantly the system of taxation itself. Thus the fact becomes 
manifest that ukimately the preservation of private property and 
confiscatory measures are incompatible. Every specific tax, as well 
as a nation's whole tax system, becomes self-defeating above a certain 
height of the rates. 

4. The Three Classes of Tax Interventionism 
The various methods of taxation which can he used for the regula- 
tion of the economy-i.e., as instruments of an interventionist policy 
-can be classified in three groups: 

I. The tax aims at totally suppressing or at restricting the produc- 
tion of definite commodities. It thus indirectly interferes with con- 
sumprim too. It does not matter whether this ed is aimed at by tile 
imposition of speciaI taxes or by exempting certain products from a 
general tax imposed upon all other products or upon those products 
which the consumcrs would have preferred in the absence of fiscal 
discrimination. Tax exemption is employed as an instrunlent of inter- 
ventionism in the case of customs duties. The domestic product is 
not burdened by the tariff which affects only the merchandise im- 
z. This is the customary method of dealing with problems of public finance. 
Cf., e.g., Ely, Adams, Lorenz, arid Young, Outlines of Economics (3d ed. New 
York, I~o),p. 702.

ported from abroad. Many countries resort to tax discrimination in 
regulating domestic production. They try, for instance, to encourage 
the production of wine, a product of small or medium-size grape 
growers, as against the production of beer, a product of big-size brew- 
eries, by submitting beer to a more burdensome excise tax than wine. 

2. The tax expropriates a part of income or weaIth. 
3. The tax expropriates income and wealth entirely. 
We do not have to deal with the third class, as it is merely a means 
for the realization of socialism and as such is outside the scope of 
interventionism. 

The first class is in its effects not different from the restrictive 
measures dealt with in the following chapter. 
The second class encompasses confiscatory measures dealt with in 
Chapter XXXII. 


XXIX. RESTRICTION OF PRODUCTION 
I. The Nature of Restriction 
WE 
and primarily intended to divert production (in the broadest 
shall deal in this chapter with those measures which are directly 

meaning of the word, including commerce and transportation) from 
the ways it would take in the unhampered market economy. Each 
authoritarian interference with business diverts production, of course. 
from the lines it would take if it were only directed by the demand 
of the consumers as manifested on the market. The characteristic mark 
of restrictive interference with production is that the diversion of 
production is not merely an unavoidable and unintentional secondary 
effect, but precisely what the authority wants to bring about. Like any 
other act of intervention, such restrictive measures affect consumption 
also. But this again, in the case of the restrictive measures wc arc 
dealing with in this chapter, is not the primary end the authority 
aims at. The government wants to interfere with production. The 
fact that its measure influences the ways of consumption also is, from 
its point of view, either altogether contrary to its intentions or at 
least an unwelcome consequence with which it puts up because it 
is unavoidable and is considered as a minor evil when compared with 
the consequences of nonintervention. 

Restriction of production means >hat the government either for- 
bids or makes more difficult or more expensive the production, trans- 
portation, or distribution of definite articles, or the application of 
definite modes of production, transportation, or distribution. The 
authority thus eliminates some of the means available for the satisfac- 
tion of human wants. The effect of its interference is that people are 
prevented from using their knowledge and abilities, their labor, and 
their material means of production in the way in which they would 
earn the highest returns and satisfy their needs as much as possible. 
Such interference makes people poorer and less satisfied. 

This is the crux of the matter. All the subtlety and hair-splitting 
wasted in the effort to invalidate this fundamentai thesis are vain. On 
the unhampered market there prevails an irresistible tendency to 
employ every factor of production for the best possible satisfaction of 


Restriction of Production 73 7 

the most urgent needs of the consumers. If the government interferes 
with this process, it can only impair satisfaction; it can never improve 
it. 

The correctness of this thesis has been proved in an excellent and 
irrefutable manner with regard to the hjstorically most important 
class of government interference with production, the barriers to 
international trade. In this field the teachings of the classical econo- 
mists, especially thosc of Ricardo, are final and settle the issue forever. 
All that a tarifi can achieve is to divert production from those loca- 
tions in which the output per unit of input is higher to locations 
in which it is lower. It does not increase production; it curtails it. 

People expatiate on alleged government encouragement of pro-
duction. Howcvcr, government does not have the power to encourage 
one branch of production except by curtailing other branches. It with- 
draws the factors of production from thosc branches in which the un- 
hampered market would employ them and directs them into other 
branches. It little matters what kind of administrative procedures the 
government resorts to for the realization of this effect. It may subsi- 
dize openly or disguise the mbsidy in enacting tariffs and thus forcing 
its subjects to defray the costs. What alone counts is the fact that 
people are forced to forego some satisfactions which they value more 
highly1 and are compensated only by satisfactions which they value 
less. ;lt the bottom of the interventionist argument there is always 
the idea that the government or the state is an entity outside and above 
the social process of production, that it owns somkhing which is not 
derived from taxing its subjects, and that it can spend this mythical 
something for definite purposes. This is the Santa Claus fable raised 
by Lord Keynes to the dignity of an economic doctrine and enthusi- 
astically endorsed by all thosc who expect personal advantage from 
government spending. As against these popular fallacies there is need 
to emphasize the truism that a government can spend or invest only 
what it takes away from its citizens and that its additional spending 
and investment curtails the citizens' spending and investment to the 
full extent of its quantity. 

While government has no power to make people more prosperous 
by interference with business, it certainly does have the power to 
make them less satisfied by restriction of production. 

r. The Prize of Restriction 
The fact that restricting production invariably involves a curtail- 
ment of the individual citizens' satisfaction does not mean that such 


Human Action 

restriction is necessarily to be regarded as a damage. A government 
does not wantonly resort to restrictive measures. It wants to attain 
certain ends and considers the restriction as the appropriate means for 
the realization of its plan. The appraisal of restrictive policies depends 
therefore on thc answer to two questions: Is the mcans chosen by the 
government fitted to attain the end sought? Is the realization of this 
end a compensation for the individual citizens' privation? In raising 
these questions we look upon restriction of production as we look 
upon taxes. Payment of taxes also directly curtails the taxpayer's 
satisfaction. But it is the price he pays for the services which govern- 
ment renders to society and to each of its mcmbers. As far as the 
government fulfills its social functions and the taxes do not exceed 
the amount required for securing the smooth operation of the govern- 
ment apparatus, they arc necessary costs and repay themselves. 

The adequacy of this mode of dealing with restrictive measures is 
especially manifest in all those cases in which restriction is resorted 
to as a substitute for taxation. The bulk of expenditure for national 
defcnse is defrayed by the treasury out of the public revenue. But 
occasionally another procedure is chosen. It happens sometimes that 
the nation's preparedness to repel aggression depends on the existence 
of certain branches of industry which would be absent in the un- 
hampered market. These industries must be subsidized, and the subsi- 
dies granted are to be considered as any other armaments expenditure. 
Their character remains the same if the government grants them in- 
directly by the imposition of an import duty for the products con- 
cerned. The difference is only that then the consumers are directly 
burdened with the costs incuired, while in the case of a government 
subsidy they defray these costs indirectly in paying higher taxes. 

In enacting restrictive measures governments and parliaments have 
hardly ever been aware of the consequences of their meddling with 
business. Thus, they have blithely assumed that protective tariffs are 
capable of raising the nation's standard of living, and they have 
stohhardy ref~sedts ad~itthe correcmess of the ezoiiomic teach- 
ings concerning the effects of protectionism. The economists' con-
demnation of protectionism is irrefutable and free of any party bias. 
For the economists do not say that protection is bad from any precon- 
ceived point of view. They show that protection cannot attain those 
ends which the governments as a rule want to attain by resorting to it. 
Thcy do not question the ultimate end of the government's action; 
they nlerely reject the means chosen as inappropriate to realize the 
ends aimed at. 

Most popular among all restrictive measures are those styled pro- 


Restriction of Production 

labor legislation. Here too the governments and public opinion badly 
misjudge the effects. They believe that restricting the hours of work 
and prohibiting child labor exclusively burdens the employers and 
is a "social gain" for the wage earners. However, this is true only 
to the extent that such laws reduce the supply of labor and thus raise 
the marginal productivity of labor as against the marginal produc- 
tivity of capital. But the drop in the supply of labor results also in a 
decrease in the total amount of goods produced and thereby in the 
average per capita consumption. The total cake shrinks, but the por- 
tion of the smaller cake which goes to the wage earners is propor- 
tionately higher than what they received from the bigger cake; con- 
comitantly the portion of the capitalists drops1 It depends on the 
concrete data of each case whether or not this outcome improves or 
impairs the real wage rates of the various groups of wage earners. 

The popular appraisal of prolabor legislation was based on the 
error that wage rates have no causal relation whatever to the value 
that the worker's labor adds to the material. Wage rates, says the "iron 
law," are determined by the minimum amount of indispensable neccs- 
sities of life; they can never rise above the subsistence level. The differ- 
ence between the value produced by the worker and the wages paid 
to him goes to the exploiting employer. If this surplus is curtailed by 
restricting the working hours, the wage earner is relieved of a part 
of his toil and trouble, his wages remain unchanged, and the employer 
is deprived of a part of his unfair profit. The restriction of total output 
curtails only the income of the exploiting bourgeois. 

It has been pointed out already that the role which prolabor legisla- 
tion pIayed in the evolution of Western capitalism was until a few 
years ago much less important than would be suggested by the vehe- 
mence with which the problems involved have been publicly dis- 
cussed. Labor legislation, for the most part, merely provided a legal 
recognition of changes in conditions already co~surnmated by the 
rapid evolution of b~siness.~ 

But in the coun&es which were slow in 
adopting capitalistic modes of production and are backward in de- 
veloping modern methods of processing and manufacturing, the 
problem of labor legislation is crucial. Deluded by the spurious doc- 
trines of interventionism, the politicians of these nations believe that 
they can improve the lot of the destitute masses by copying the labor 
legislation of the most advanced capitaIistic countries. They look upon 

I. Entrepreneurial profits and losses are riot affected by prolabor legislation as 
they entirely depend on the more or less successful adjustment of production to 
the changing conditions of the market. With regard to these, labor legislation 
counts only as a factor producing change.

Human Actiorz 
the problems involved as if they were merely to be treated from what 
is erroneously called the "human angle" and fail to recognize the 
real issue. 
It is a sad fact indeed that in Asia many millions of tender children 
are destitute and starving, that wages arc extremely low when com- 
pared with American or Western European standards, that hours of 
work are long, and that sanitary conditions in the workshops are 
deplorable. 13ut there is no means of eliminating these evils other than 
to work, to produce, and to save tnore and thus to accumulate more 
capital. This is indispensable for any lasting improvement. The re- 
strictive measures advocated by self-styled philanthropists and hu- 
manitarians would be futile. They would not only fail to improve 
conditions, they would make things a good deal worse. If the parents 
are too poor to feed their children adequately, prohibition of child 
labor condemns the children to starvation. If the marginal productivity 
of labor is so low that a worker can only earn in ten hours wages which 
are substandard when compared with American wages, one does not 
benefit the laborer by decreeing the eight-hour day. 
The problem under discussion is not the desirability of improving 
the wage earners' material well-being. Thc advocates of what are 
miscalled prolabor laws intentionally confuse the issue in repeating 
again and again that more leisure, higher real wages, and freeing 
children and married women from the necessity of seeking jobs would 
make the families of the workers happier. They resort to falsehood and 
mean calumny in calling those who oppose such laws as detrimental 
to the vital interests of the wage earners "labor-baiters" and "enemies 
of labor." The disagreement does not refer to the ends sought; it con- 
cerns solely the means to be applied for their realization. The question 
is not whether or not improvement of the masses' welfare is desirable. 
It is cxclusivcly whether or not government decrees restricting the 
hours of work and the employment of women and children are the 
right means for raising the workers' standard of living. This is a purely 
cataiiactic probiem to be soived by economm. Emotionai taik is 
beside the point. It is a poor disguise for the fact that these self- 
righteous advocates of restriction are unable to advance any tenable 
objections to the economists' well-founded argumentation. 
The fact that the standard of living of the average American worker 
is incomparably more satisfactory than that of the average Chinese 
worker, that in the Cnited States hours of work are shorter and that 
the children are sent to school and not to the factories, is not an 
achievement of the government and of the laws of the country. It is 
the outcome of the fact that the capital invested per head of the em- 


Restriction of Production 

ployees is much greater than in China and that consequently the 
marginal productivity of labor is much higher. This is not the merit 
of "social policies"; it is the result of the laissez faire methods of the 
past which abstained from sabotaging the evolution of capitalism. It 
is this laissez faire that the Asiatics must adopt if they want to improve 
the lot of their peoples. 

The poverty of Asia and other backward countries is due to :he 
same causes which made conditions unsatisfactory in the early periods 
of Western capitalism. While population figures increased rapidly, 
restrictive policies delayed the adjustment of production methods to 
the needs of the growing number of mouths. It is to the irnperishablc 
credit of the laissez faire economists, whom the typical textbooks of 
our universities dismiss as pessimists and apologists of the unfair greed 
of exploiting bourgeois, that they paved the way for economic 
freedom which raised the average standard of living to an unprecc- 
dented height. 

Economics is not dogmatic, as the self-styled "unorthodox" advo-
cates of government omnipotence and totalitarian dictatorship con- 
tend. Economics neither approves nor disapproves of government 
measures restricting production and output. It merely considers it 
its duty to clarify the consequences of such measures. The choice 
of policies to be adopted devolves upon the people. But in choosing 
they must not disregard the teachings of economics if they want to 
attain the ends sought. 

There are certainly cases in which people may consider definite 
restrictive measures as justified. Regulations concerning fire preven- 
tion are restrictive and raise the cost of production. Rut the curtail- 
ment of total output they bring about is the price to be paid for avoid- 
ance of greater disaster. The decision about each restrictive measure 
is to be made on the ground of a meticulous weighing of the costs 
to be incurred and the prize to be obtained. No reasonable man could 
possibly question this rule. 

3. Restriction as a Privilege 
Every disarrangement of the market data affects various individuals 
and groups of individuals in a different way. For some people it is a 
boon, for others a blow. Only after a while, when production is ad- 
justed to the emergence of the new datum, are these effects exhausted. 
Thus a restrictive measure, while placing the immense majority at a 
disadvantage, may temporarily improve some people's position. For 
those favored the measure is tantamount to the acquisition of a 


Human Action 

privilege. They are asking for such measures because they want to be 
privileged. 

Here again the most striking example is provided by protectionism. 
The imposition of a duty on the importation of a commodity burdens 
the consumers. But to the domestic producers it is a boon. From their 
point of view decreeing new tariffs and raising already existing tariffs 
is an excellent thing. 

The same is valid with regard to many other restrictive measures. 
If the government restricts--either by direct restriction or by fiscal 
discrimination-big business and corporations, the competitive posi- 
tion of small-size enterprises is strengthened. If it restricts the opera- 
tion of big stores and chain stores, the small shopkeepers rejoice. 

It is important to realize that what those benefited by these measures 
consider an advantage for themselves lasts only for a limited time. In 
the long run the privilege accorded to a definite class of producers 
loses its power to create specific gains. The privileged branch attracts 
newcomers, and their con~petition tends to eliminate the specific gains 
derived from the privilege. Thus the eagerness of the law's pet children 
to acquire privileges is insatiable. They continue to ask for new 
privileges because the old ones lose their power. 

On the other hand, the repeal of a restrictive measure to the exist- 
ence of which the structure of production has already been adjusted 
means a new disarrangement of the market data, favors the short-run 
interests of some people and hurts the short-run interests of other 
people. Let us illustrate the issue by referring to a tariff item. Ruritania 
years ago, let us say in 1920, decreed a tariff on the importation of 
leather. This was a boon for the enterprises which at the moment 
happened to be engaged in the tanning industry. But then later the 
size of the industry expanded and the windfall gains which the tanners 
enjoyed in 1920 and in the following years petered out. What re- 
mains is merely the fact that a part of the world's leather production 
is shifted from locations in which the output per unit of input is higher, 
to locaticions in Ruritania in which production requires higher costs. 
The residents of Ruritania pay higher prices for leather than they 
would pay in the absence of the tariff. As a greater part of ~uritania's 
capital and labor is employed in the tanneries than would be the case 
under free trade for leather, some other domestic industries shrank or 
were at least prevented from growing. Less leather is imported from 
abroad and a smaller amount of Ruritanian products is exported as pay- 
ment for leather imported. The volun~e of Ruritania's foreign trade is 
curtailed. hTot a single soul in the whole world derives any advantage 
from the preservation of the old tariff. On the contrary, everyone is 


Restriction of Production 

hurt by the drop in the total output of mankind's industrial effort. 
If the policy adopted by Ruritania with regard to leather were to be 
adopted by all nations and with regard to every kind of merchandise 
in the most rigid way so as to abolish international trade altogether 
and to make every nation perfcctIy autarkic, all people wouId have to 
forego entirely the advantages which the international division of 
labor gives them. 

It is obvious that the repeal of the Ruritanian tariff on leather must 
in the long run benefit everybody, Ruritanians as well as foreigners. 
However, in the short run it would hurt the interests of the capitalists 
who have invested in Ruritanian tanneries. It would no less hurt the 
short-run interests of the Ruritanian workers specialized in tannery 
work. A part of them would have either to emigrate or to change 
their occupation. These capitalists and workers passionately fight all 
attempts to lower the leather tariff or to abolish it altogether. 

This shows clearly why it is politically extremely difiicult to brush 
away measures restricting production once the structure of business 
has been adjusted to their existence. Although their effects are perni- 
cious to everybody, their disappearance is in the short run disadvan- 
tageous to special groups. These special groups intercsted in the 
preservation of the restrictive measures are, of course, only minorities. 
In Ruritania only the small fraction of the population engaged in the 
tanneries can suffer from the abolition of the tariff on leather. The 
immense majority are buyers of leather and leather goods and would 
be benefited by a drop in their prices. Outside the boundaries of 
Ruritania, only those people would be hurt who are engaged in 
those industries which will shrink because the leather industry will 
expand. 

The last objection advanced by the opponents of free trade runs 
this way: Granted that only those Ruritanians engaged in tanning 
hides are immediately interested in the preservation of the tariff on 
leather. But every Ruritanian belongs to one of the many branches 
of production. If each domestic product is protected by the tariff, 
the transition to free trade hurts the interests of each industry and 
thereby those of all speciaIized groups of capital and labor the sum 
of which is the whole nation. It follows that repealing the tariff would 
in the short run be prejudicial to all citizens. And it is short-run interests 
only that count. 

This argument invoIves a threefold error. First, it is not true that 

a11 branches of industry would be hurt by the transition to free trade. 

On the contrary. Those branches in which the comparative costs of 

production are lowest will expand under free trade. Their short-run 


interests would be favored by the abolition of the tariff. The tariff 
on those products they themselves turn out is of no advantage for 
them, as they could not only survive, but expand under free trade. 
The tariff on those products for which the comparative cost is higher 
in Ruritania than abroad hurts them by directing capital and labor, 
which otherwise would have fertilized them, into those other 
branches. 

Second, the short-run principle is entirely fallacious. In the short 
run every change in the market data hurts those who did not anticipate 
it in time. A consistent champion of the short-run principle must 
advocate perfect rigidity and immutability of a11 data and oppose any 
change, including any therapeutical and technological irnpr~vernent.~ 
If in acting people were always to prefer the avoidance of an evil in 
the nearer future to the avoidance of an evil in the remoter future, 
they would come down to the animal level. It is the very essence of 
human action as distinct from animal behavior that it consciously re- 
nounces some tcmporally nearer satisfaction in order to reap some 
greater but ternporalIy remoter satisfaction. Time preference is not 
absolute with man; it is only one of the items entering into the weigh- 
ing and balancing of pros and cons. Adan swallows hitter pills for thc 
sake of beneficent effects to be reaped at a later date. Therc cannot be 
any question of unconditionally preferring what is good in the short 
run to what is good in the long run; the intensity of the satisfaction 
expected from each of the alternatives must be taken into account 
too. 

Finally, if the problem of the abolition of Ruritania's comprehensive 
tariff system is under discussion, one must not forget the fact that 
the short-run interests of those engaged in tanning are hurt only by 
the abolition of one of the items of the tariff while thcy are favored 
by the abolition of thc other items concerning the products of the 
industries in which comparative cost is high. It is true that wage rates 
of the tannery workers will drop for some time as against those in 
other branches and that some time will elapse until the appropriate 
long-run proportion between wage rates in the various branches of 
Ruritanian production will be established. But concornitantly with 
the merely temporary drop in their earnings, these workers will ex- 
perience a drop in the prices of many articles they are buying. And 
this tendency toward an improvement in their conditions is not a 
phenomenon only of the period of transition. It is the consummation 
of the lasting blessings of free trade which, in shifting every branch 

3. This consistency was displayed by some hTazi philosophers. Cf. Sombart, 
A New Socia! Philosophy, pp. 242-245. 

Restriction of Production 

of industry to the location in which comparative cost is lowest, in- 
creases the productivity of labor and the total quantity of goods 
produced. It is the lasting long-run boon which free trade secures to 
every member of the market society. 

The opposition to the abolition of tariff protection would be reason- 
able from the personal point of view of those engaged in the leather 
industry if the tariff on leather were the onIy tariff. Then one could 
explain their attitude as dictated by status interests, the interests of a 
caste which would be temporarily hurt by the abolition of a privilege 
although its mere preservation no longer confers any benefit on 
them. But in this hypothetical case the opposition of the tanners would 
be hopeless. The majority of the nation would overrule it. What 
strengthens the ranks of the protectionists is the fact that the tariff on 
leather is no exception, that many branches of industry are in a sirnilar 
position and are fighting the abolition of tariff items concerning their 
own branch. This is, of course, not an alliance based on each group's 
special group interests. If everybody is protected to the same extent, 
everybody not only loses as consumer as much as he gains as producer. 
Everybody is harmed by the general drop in the productivity of labor 
which the shifting of industries from more favorable to less favorable 
locations brings about. Conversely the aboIition of all tariff items 
would benefit everybody in the long run, while the short-run harm 
which the abolition of some special tariff item brings to the special 
interests of the group concerned is already in the short run at least 
partly compensated by the consequences of the abolition of the tariff 
on the products the members of this group are buying and consuming. 

Many people look upon tariff protection as if it were a privilege 
accorded to their nation's wage earners, procuring them, for the full 
duration of its existence, a higher standard of living than they would 
enjoy under free trade. This argument is advanced not only in thc 
United States, but in every country in the world in which average 
real wage rates are higher than in some other country. 

Now, it is true that under perfect mobility of capital and labor 
there would prevail all over the world a tendency toward an equaliza- 
tion of the price paid for labor of the same kind and quality.* Yet, 
even if there were free trade for products, this tendency is absent in 
our real worId of migration barriers and institutions hindering foreign 
investment of capital. The marginal productivity of labor is higher 
in the United States than it is in China because capital invested per head 
of the working population is greater, and because Chinese workers are 
prevented from moving to America and competing on the American

labor market. There is no need, in dealing with the explanation of this 
difference, to investigate whether natural resources are or are not 
more abundant in America than in China and whether or not the 
Chinese worker is racially inferior to the American worker. However 
this may be, these facts, namely, the institutional checks upon the mo- 
bility of capital and labor, suffice to account for the absence of the 
equalization tendency. As the abolition of the American tariff could 
not affect these two facts, it could not impair the standard of living 
of the A~nerican wage earner in an adverse sense. 

On the contrary. Given a state of affairs in which the mobility of 
capital and labor is restricted, the transition to free trade for products 
must necessarily raisc the American standard of life. Those industries 
in which American costs are higher (American productivity is lower) 
would shrink and those in which costs are lower (productivity is 
higher) would expand. 

It is certainly true that wage rates in Swiss watchmaking and in 
Chinese embroidering are low when compared with wage rates in 
the competing American industries. Under free trade the Swiss and 
the Chinese would expand their sales on the American market and the 
sales of their American competitors would shrink. But this is only 
a part of the conseqllences of free trade. Selling and producing more, 
the Swiss and Chinese would earn and buy more. It does not matter 
whether they themselves buy more of the products of other American 
industries or whether they increase their domestic purchases and those 
in other countries, for instance, in France. Whatever happens, the 
equivaIent of the additional dollars they earned must finally go to the 
United States and increase the sales of some American industries. If the 
Swiss and Chinese do not give away their products as a gift, they must 
spend these dollars in buying. 

The popular opinion to the contrary is due to the illusory idea that 
America could expand its purchases of imported products by reducing 
the total sum of its citizens' cash holdings. This is the notorious fallacy 
according to whirh pcnple buy withol~tregd to the size of thcir 
cash holdings, and according to which the very existence of cash 
holdings is simply the outcome of the fact that something is left over 
because there is nothing more to buy. We have already shown whv 
this Mercantilist doctrine is entirely wrong.5 

What the tariff really brings about in the field of wage rates and 
the wage earners' standard of living is something quite different. 
In a world in which there is free trade for commodities, while the 
migration of workers and foreign investment are restricted, there pre-

Restriction of Production 

vails a tendency toward an establishment of a definite relation between 
the wages paid for the same kind and quality of labor in various 
countries. There cannot prevail a tendency toward an equalization 
of wage rates. But the final price to be paid for labor in various 
countries is in a certain numerical relation. This final price is character- 
ized by the fact that all those eager to earn wages get a job and all 
those eager to employ workers are able to hire as many hands as they 
want. There is "full employment." 

Let us assume that there are two countries only-Ruritania and 
Mauretania. In Ruritania the final wage rate is double what it is in 
Mauretania. Now the government of Ruritania resorts to one of those 
measures which are erroneously styled "prolabor." It burdens the 
employers with an additional expenditure the si7.e of which is pro-
portional to the number of workers employed. For example, it reduces 
the hours of work without ~ermitting a corresponding drop in weekly 
wage rates. The result is a drop in the quantity of goods produced and 
a rise in the price of the unit: of every good. The individuaI worker 
enjoys more leisure, but his standard of living is curtailed. What else 
could a general decrease in the quantity of goods availablc bring 
about? 

This outcome is an internal event in Ruritania. It would emerge also 
in the absence of any foreign trade. The fact that Ruritania is not 
autarkic, but buys from and sells to Mauretania, does not alter its 
essential features. But it implicates Mauretania. As the Ruritanians 
produce and consume less, they will buy less from Mauretania. In 
Mauretania there will not be a general drop in production. But some 
industries which produced for export to Ruritania will henceforth 
have to produce for the domestic Mauretanian marltct. Mauretania 
will see the volume of its foreign trade drop; it will become, willy-nilly 
more autarkic. This is a blessing in the eyes of the protectionists. In 
truth, it means deterioration in the standard of living; production at 
higher costs is substituted for that at lower costs. What Mauretania 
experiences is the same thing that the residents of an autarkic country 
would experience if an act of God were to curtail the productivity of 
onc of the country's industries. As far as there is division of labor, 
everybody is affected by a drop in the amount other people contribute 
to supplying the market. 

However, these inexorable final international conscquences of 
Ruritania's new pro-labor law will not affect the various branches of 
Mauretania7s industry in the same way. A sequence of steps is needed 
in both countries until at last a perfect adjustment of production to 
the new state of data is brought about. These short-run effects are 


Human Action 

different from the long-run effects. They are more spectacular than 
the long-run effects. While hardly anybody can fail to notice the 
short-run effects, the long-run effects are recognized only by econ- 
omists. While it is not difficult to conceal the long-run effects from 
the public, something must be done about the easily recognizable 
short-run effects lest the enthusiasm for such allcgcdly pro-labor 
legislation fade away. 

The first short-run effect to appear is the weakening of the competi- 
tive power of some Ruritanian branches of production as against those 
of Mauretania. As prices rise in Ruritania, it becomes possible for 
some Maurctanians to cxpand their sales in Ruritania. This is a tempo- 
rary effect only; in the end the total sales of all Mauretanian industries 
in Ruritania will drop. It is possible that in spite of this general drop 
in the total amount of Mauretanian exports to Ruritania, some of the 
Mauretanian industries will expand their sales in the long run. (This 
dcpcnds on the new configuration of comparative costs.) But there is 
no necessary interconnection between these short-run and long-run 
effects. The adjustments of the period of transition create kaleidoscop- 
ically changing situations which may differ entirely from the final out- 
come. Yet the short-sighted public's attcntion is cornpletcly absorbed 
by these short-run effects. 'They hear the businessmen effcctcd corn- 
piah that the new Ruritanian law gives to Mauretanians the opportu- 
nity to undersell both in Ruritania and in Mauretania. They see that 
some Ruritanian businessmen are forced to restrict their production 
and to dischargc workers. And they begin to suspect that something 
may be wrong with the teachings of the self-styled "unorthodox 
friends of labor." 

But the picture is different if there is in Ruritania a tariff high 
enough to prevent Mauretanians from even temporarily expanding 
their sales on the Ruritanian market. Then the most spectacular short- 
run effects of the new measure are masked in such a way that the 
public does not become aware of them. The long-run effects, of

sequence of short-run effects which is less offensive because ~Ess visible. 
The talk about alleged "social gains" produced by the shortening of 
the hours of work is not exploded by the immehiate emergence of 
effects which everyone, and most of all the discharged workers, con- 
sider undesirable. 

The main function of tariffs and other protectionist devices today is 
to disguise the real effects of interventionist policies designcd to raise 
the standard of living of the masses. Economic nationalism is the 
necessary complement of these popular policies which pretend to

4. Restriction as an Econon~ic System 
There are, as has been shown, cases in which a restrictive measure 
can attain the end sought by its application. If those resorting to such 
a measure think that the attainment of this goal is more important 
than the disadvantages brought about by the restriction-i.e., the 
curtailment in the quantity of material goods available for consump- 
tion-the recourse to restriction is justified from the point of view 
of their value judgments. They incur costs and pay a price in ordcr 
to get something that they value more than what they had to expend 
or to forego. Nobody, and certainly not the theorist, is in a position 
to argue with them about the propriety of their value judgments. 

The only adequate mode of dealing with measures restricting pro. 
duction is to look at them as sacrifices made for the attainment of a 
definite end. They are quasi-expenditures and quasi-consumption. 
They are an employment of things that could be produced and con- 
sumed in one way for the realization of certain other ends. These 
things are prevented from coming into existence, but this quasi- 
consumption is precisely what satisfies the authors of these measures 
better than the increase in goods available which the omission of the 
restriction would have produced. 

With certain restrictive measures this point of view is universally 
adopted. If a government decrees that a piece of land should be kept 
in its natural state as a national park and should be withheld from any 
other utilization, nobody would classify such a venture as anything 
else than an expenditure. The government deprives the citizens of 
the increment in various products which the cultivation of this land 
could bring about, in ordcr to provide them with another satisfac- 
tion. 

it ioiiows hat restricrion of production can never piay any roie 
other than that of an ancillary complement of a system of production. 
One cannot construct a system of economic action out of such re- 
strictive measures alone. No complex of such measures can be linked 
together into an integrated economic system. They cannot form a 
system of production. They belong in the sphere of consumption, not 
in the sphere of production. 

In scrutinizing the problems of interventionism w-e are intent upon 

examining the claims of the advocates of government interference with 

6. See also what has been said about the function of cartels on pp. 362-366. 

7So Human Action 
business that their system offers an alternative to other economic 
systems. No such claim can reasonably be raised with regard to 
measures restricting production. The best they can attain is curtail- 
ment of output and satisfaction. Wealth is produced by expending 
a certain quantity of factors of production. Curtailing this quantity 
does not increase, but decreases, the amount of goods produced. Even 
if the ends aimed at by shortening the hours of work could be attained 
by such a decree, it would not be a measure of production. It is in- 
variably a way of cutting down output. 
Capitalism is a system of social production. Socialism, say the social- 
ists, is also a system of social production. But with regard to measures 
restricting production, even the interventionists cannQt raise a similar 
claim. They can only say that under capitalism too much is produced 
and that they want to prevent the production of this surplus in order 
to realize other ends. They themselves must confess that there are 
limits to the application of restriction. 
Economics does not contend that restriction is a bad system of pro- 
duction. It asserts that it is not a system of production, at all, but rather 
a system of quasi-consumption, Most of the ends the interventionists 
want to attain by restriction cannot be attained this way. But even 
where restrictive measures are fit to attain the ends sought, they are 
only restrictive.? 
The enormous popularity which restriction enjoys in our day is 
due to the fact that people do not recognize its consequences. In deal- 
ing with the problem of shortening the hours of work by government 
decree, the public is not aware of the fact that total output must drop 
and that it is very probable that the wage earners' standard of living 
will be potentially lowered too. It is a dogma of present-day "un- 
orthodoxy" that such a "prolabor" measure is a "social gain" for the 
workers and that the costs of these gains fall entirely upon the em-
ployers. Whoever questions this dogma is branded as a "sycophantic" 
apologist of the unfair pretensions of rugged exploiters, and pitilessly 
persecuted. It is insinuated that he wants to reduce the wage earners 
to the poverty and the long working hours of the early stages of 
modern industrialism. 
As against all this slander it is important to emphasize again that 
what produces wealth and well-being is production and not restric- 
tion. That in the capitalist countries the average wage earner consumes 
more goods and can afford to enjoy more leisure than his ancestors, 
and that he can support his wife and children and need not send them

Restriction of Production 

to work, is not an achievement of governments and labor unions. It 
is the outcome of the fact that profit-seeking business has accumulated 
and invested more capital and thus increased a thousandfold the 
productivity of labor. 


XXX. INTERFERENCE WITH THE STRTJCTURE 
OF PRICES 

I. The Govcrnrnent and the Autonomy of the Market 
~RFERENCEwith the structure of the market means that the 
authority aims at fixing prices for commodities and services and 

I"'" 

interest rates at a height different from what the unhampered ~narket 
would have determined. It decrees, or empowers--either tacitly or 
expressly--definite groups of people to decree, prices and rates which 
are to be considered either as maxima or as minima, and it provides for 
the enforcement of such decrees by coercion and compulsion. 

In resorting to such measurcs the government wants to favor either 
the buyer-as in the case of maximum prices-or the seller-as in 
the case of minimum prices. The maximum price is designed to niakc 
it possible for the buyer to procure what he wants at a price lower than 
that of the unhampered market. The minimum price is designed to 
make it possiblc for the seller to disposc of his merchandise or his 
services at a price higher than that of the unhampered market. It 
depends on the political balance of forces which groups the authority 
wants to favor. At times governments have resorted to maximum 
prices, at other times to minimum prices for various commodities. At 
times they have decreed maximum wage rates, at other times minimum 
wage rates. It is only with regard to intcrcst that they have nevcr had 
recourse to minimum rates; when they have interfered, they have al- 
ways decreed maximum interest rates. They have always looked 
askance upon saving, investing, and moneylending.

ownership of the means of production, entrepreneurship, and private 
initiative, virtually disappear altogether. No individual any longer has 
the opportunity to influence the process of production of his own 
accord; every individual is bound to obey the orders of the supreme 
board of production management. What in the complex of these 
orders are called prices, wage rates, and interest rates are no longer 


Interference with the Strncture of Prices 

prices, wage rates, and interest rates in the catallactic sense of these 
terms. They are merely quantitative determinations fixed by the 
director without reference to a market process. If the governments 
resorting to pricc control and the reformers advocating pricc control 
were always intent upon the establishment of socialism of the German 
pattern, there would be no need for economics to deal with rice con-
trol separately. All that has to be said with reference to such price 
control is already contained in the analysis of sociaIism. 

Many advocates of government interference with prices have been 
and are very much confused with regard to this issue. They have 
failed to recognize the fundamental difference between a market 
economy and a nonmarket society. The haziness of their ideas has 
been reflected in vague and ambiguous language and in a bewildered 
terminology. They have tried to amalgamate things entirely incorn- 
patible with one another. Their main concepts arc examples of the 
inconsistency which logicians call contradictio in adjecto. 

However, there were and are advocates of price control who have 
openly declared that they want to preserve the market economy. 
They are outspoken in their assertion that govcrnment fixing of prices, 
wage rates, and intercst rates can attain the ends the govcrnment wants 
to attain by their promulgation without abolishing altogether the 
market and private ownership of the means of production. They even 
declare that price control is the best or the only means of preserving 
the system of private enterprise and of preventing the coming of 
socialism. They become very indignant if somebody questions the 
correctness of their doctrine and shows that price control, if it is 
not to make things worse from the point of view of the governments 
and the intervcntionist doctrinaires, must finally result in socialism. 
They protest that they are neither socialists nor communists, and that 
they aim at economic freedom and not at totalitarianism. 

It is the tenets of these iilterventionists that we havc to examine. 

The problem is whcther it is possible for the police power to attain 

the ends it wants to attain by fixing prices, wage rates, and interest 

rates at a height different from what the unhampered matket would 

have determined. It is beyond doubt that a strong and resolute govern- 

ment has the power to decree such maximum or ~ninimum rates and to 

take revenge upon the disobedient. But the question is whcther or 

not the authority can attain those ends which it wants to attain by re- 

sorting to such decrees. 

History is a long record of price ceilings and anti-usury laws. 

Again and again emperors, kings, and revolutionary dictators have 

tried to meddle with the market phenomena. Severe punishment was 


Huiwan Action 

inflicted on refractory dealers and farmers. Many people fell victim 
to persecutions whidh met with the enthusiastic approd of the 
masscs. Nonetheless, all these endeavors failed. The explanation which 
thc writings of lawyers, theologians, and philosophers provided for 
the failure was in full agreement with the ideas held by the rulers and 
the nlasses. Man, they said, is intrinsically selfish and sinful, and thc 
authorities were unfdrtunately too lax in enforcing the law. What was 
needed was more firmness and peremptoriness on the part of those in 
power. 

Cognizance of the issue involved was first reached with regard to 
a special problem. Various governments long practiced currency de- 
basement. Thcy substituted baser and cheaper metals for a part of the 
gold or silver which the coins previously contained, or they reduced 
thc weight and the size of the coins. But they retained for the debased 
coins the customary names of the old ones and decreed that they 
should be given and received at the nominal par. Then iater the 
governments tried to enjoin on their subjects analogous constraint with 
regard to the exchange ratio between gold and silver and that between 
metallic money and credit money or fiat money. In searching for the 
causes which made all such dccrces abortive, the forerunners of 
economic thought had already discovered by the last centuries of the 
Middle Ages the regularity which was later called Gresham's Law. 
There was still a long way to go from this isolated insight to the point 
where the philosophers of the eighteenth century became aware of 
the interconnectedness of all market phenomena. 

In describing the results of their reasoning the classical economists 
and their successors sometimes resorted to idiomatic expressions which 
could easily be misinterpreted by those who wanted to misinterpret 
them. They occasionally spoke of the "impossibility" of price control. 
What they rcally meant was not that such decrees are impossible, but 
that they cannot attain those ends which the governments are trying 
to attain and that they make things worse, not better. They concluded 
that such decrees are contrary to purpose and inexpedient. 

It is necessary to see clearly that the problem of price control is 
not merely one of the problems to be dealt with by economics, not 
a problem with regard to which there can arise disagreement among 
various economists. The issue involved is rather: Is there any such 
thing as economics? Is there any regularity in the sequence and inter- 
connectedness of the market phenomena? He who answers these two 
questions in the ncgative denies the very possibility, rationality, and 
existence of economics as a branch of ltnowlcdge. He returns to the 
bclicfs held in the ages which preceded the evolution of economics. 


interference with the Structu~e of Prices 

755 

He declares to be untrue the assertion that there is any economic law 
and that prices, wage rates, and interest rates are uniquely determined 
by the data of the market. He contends that the police have the power 
to determine these market phenomena ad libitum. An advocate of 
socialjsm need not necessarily negate economics; his postulates do not 
necessarily imply the indeterminateness of the market phenomena. 
But the interventionist, in advocating price control, cannot help nul- 
lifying the very existence of economics. Nothing is left of economics 
if one denies the law of the market. 

The German Historical School was consistent in its radical con- 
demnation of economics and in its endeavors to substitute wirtschaft- 
liche Staatswissenschaften (the economic aspects of political science) 
for economics. So were many adepts of British Fabianism and Am~ri- 
can Institutionalism. But those authors who do not totally reject 
economics and yet assert that price control can attain the ends sought 
lamentably contradict themselves. It is logically impossible to recon- 
cile the point of view of the econonlist and that of the interventionist. 
If prices are uniquely determined by the market data, they cannot 
be freely manipulated by government compulsion. The government's 
decree is just a new datum, and its effects are determined by the opera- 
tion of the market. It need not necessarily produce those results which 
the govcrnrnent wants to realize in resorting to it. It may happen that 
the final outcome of the interference is, from the point of view of 
the government's intention, even more undesirable than the previous 
state of affairs which the government wanted to alter. 

One does not invaIidate these propositions by putting the term 
economic law in quotation marks and by finding fault with the notion 
of the law. In speaking of the laws of nature we have in mind the 
fact that there prevails an inexorable interconnectedness of physical 
and biological phenomena and that acting man must submit to this 
regularity if he wants to succeed. In speaking of the laws of human 
action we refer to the fact that such an inexorable interconnectedness 
of phenomena is present also in the field of human action as such and 
that acting man must recognize this regularity too if he wants to suc- 
ceed. The reality of the laws of praxeology is revealed to man by the 
same signs that reveal the reality of natural law, namely, the fact that 
his power to attain his ends is restricted and conditioned. In the absence 
of laws man would either be omnipotent and would never feel any 
uneasiness which he could not remove instantly and totally, or he 
could not act at all. 

These laws of the universe must not be confused with the man-made 

laws of the country and with man-made moral precepts. The laws of 


Hurnan Action 

the universe about which physics, biology, and praxeology provide 
knowledge are independent of the human will, they are primary onto- 
logical facts rigidly restricting man's power to act. The moial prc- 
cepts and the laws of the country are means by which men seek to 
attain certain ends. Whether or not these ends can really be attained 
this way depends on the laws of the universe. The man-made laws arc 
suitable if they are fit to attain these ends and contrary to purpose 
if they are not. They are open to examination from the point of view 
of their suitableness or unsuitableness. With regard to the laws of the 
universe any doubt of their suitableness is supererogatory and vain. 
They are what they arc and take care of themselves. Their violation 
penalizes itself. But the man-made laws need to be enforced by special 
sanctions. 

Only the insane venture to disregard physical and biological laws. 
But it is quite common to disdain economic laws. Rulers do not like 
to admit that their power is restricted by any laws other than those 
of physics and biology. They never ascribe their failures and frustra- 
tions to the violation of economic law. 

Foremost in the repudiation of economic knowledge was the Ger- 
man Historical School. It was an unbearable idea to these professors 
that their lofty idols, the Hohenzollern Electors of Brandenburg and 
Kings of Prussia, should have lacked ornnipotcnce. To refute the 
teachings of the economists, they buried themselves in old documents 
and compiled numerous volumes dealing with the history of the ad- 
ministration of these glorious princes. This, they wrote, is a realistic 
approach to thc problems of statc and government. Here you find 
unadulterated facts and real life, not the bloodless abstractions and 
faulty generalizations of the British doctrinaires. In truth, all that these 
ponderous tomes report is a long record of policies and measures 
which failed precisely because of their neglect of economic law. x~ 
more instructive case history could ever be written than these Actn 

Rorussica. 

Eowever, ec~mmicsc=mr accuiesce i:: mchexemi;!ifica;ioi;. It

must enter into a precise scrutiny of the mode in which the market 
reacts to government interference with the price structure. 

2. The Market's Reaction to Government Interference 
The characteristic feature of the market price is that it equalizes 
supply and demand. The size of the demand coincides with the size of 
supply not onIy in the imaginary construction of the evenly rotating 
economy. The notion of the plain state of rest as developed by the 


Interference with the Structure of Prices 

757 

elementary theory of prices is a faithful description of what comes 
to pass in the market at every instant. Any deviation of a market price 
from the height at which supply and demand are equal is-in the un- 
hampered market-self-liquidating. 

But if the government fixes prices at a height different from what 
the market would have fixed if left alone, this equilibrium of demand 
and supply is disturbed. Then there are-with maximum prices-po- 
tential buyers who cannot buy although they are ready to pay the 
price fixed by the authority, or even a higher price. Then there are- 
with minimum prices-potential sellers who cannot sell although they 
are ready to sell at the price fixed by the authority, or even at a lower 
price. The price can no longer segregate those potential buyers and 
sellers who can buy or sell from those who cannot. A different 
principle for rhe allocation of the goods and services concerned and 
for the selection of those who are to receive portions of the supply 
available necessarily comes into operation. It may be that only those 
are in a position to buy who come first, or only those to whom particu- 
lar circumstances (such as personal connections) assign a privileged 
position, or only those ruthless fellows who chase away their rivals 
by resorting to intimidation or violence. If the authority does not 
want chance or violence to determine the allocation of the supply 
available and conditions to become chaotic, it must itself regulate the 
amount which each individuaI is permitted to buy. It must resort to 
rationing." 

But rationing does not affect the core of the issue. The allocation 
of portions of the supply already produced and available to the various 
individuals eager to obtain a quantity of the goods concerned is only 
a secondary function of the market. Its primary function is the direc- 
tion of production. It directs the employment of the factors of pro- 
duction into those channels in which they satisfy the most urgent 
needs of the consumers. If the government's price ceiling refers only 
to one consumers' good or to a limited amount of consumers' goods 
while the prices of the complementary factors of production are left 
free, production of the consumers1 goods concerned will drop. The 
marginal producers will discontinue producing them lest they suffer 
losses. The not absolutely specific factors of production will be em- 
ployed to a greater extent for the production of other goods not 
subject to price ceilings. A greater part of the absolutely specific 
factors of production will remain unused than would have remained 

I. For the sake of simplicity we deal in the further disquisitions of this section 
only with maximum prices for commodities and in the next section only with 
minimum wage rates. However, our statements are, mutatis mutandis, equally 
valid for minimum prices for commodities and maximum wage rates. 

Human Action 
in the absence of price ceilings. There emerges a tendency to shift 
production activities from the production of the goods affected by 
the maximum prices into the production of other goods. This out- 
come is, however, manifestly contrary to the intentions of the govern- 
ment. In resorting to price ceilings the authority wanted to make the 
commodities concerned more easily accessible to the consumers. It 
considered precisely those commodities so vital that it singled them 
out for a special measure in order to make it possible even for poor 
people to be amply supplied with them. But the result of the govern- 
ment's interference is that production of these commodities drops 
or stops altogether. It is a complete failure. 
It would be vain for the government to try to remove these un- 
desired consequences by decreeing maximum prices likewise for the 
factors of production needed for the production of the consumers' 
goods the prices of which it has fixed. Such a measure would be suc- 
cessful only if all factors of production required were absolutely 
specific. As this can never be the case, the government must add to 
its first measure, fixing the price of only one consumers' good below 
the potential market price, more and more price ceilings, not only for 
all other consumers' goods and for all material factors of production, 
but no less for labor. It must compel every entrepreneur, capitalist, 
and employee to continue producing at the prices, wage rates, and 
interest rates which the government has fixed, to produce those 
quantities which the government orders them to produce, and to sell 
the products to those people-producers or consumers-whom the 
government determines. If one branch of production were to be 
exempt from this regimentation, capital and labor would flow into it; 
production would be restricted precisely in those other-regimented 
-branches which the government considered so important that it 
interfered with the conduct of their affairs. 
Economics does not say that isolated government interference with 
the prices of only one commodity or a few commodities is unfair, 
bad, or unfeasibie. it says that such interference produces resuits 
contrary to its purpose, that it makes conditions worse, not better, 
from the point of view of the government and those backing ks inter-
f erence. Before the government interfered, the goods concerned were, 
in the eyes of the government, too dear. As a result of the maximum 
price their supply dwindles or disappears altogether. The government 
interfered because it considered these commodities especially vital, 
necessary, indispensable. But its action curtailed the supply available. 
It is therefore, from the point of view of the government, absurd and 
nonsensical. 


Interference with the Structure of Prices 7 59 

If the government is unwilling to acquiesce in this undesired and 
undesirable outcome and goes further and further, if it fixes the prices 
of all goods and services of all orders and obliges a11 people to continue 
producing and working at these prices and wage rates, it eliminates 
the market altogether. Then the planned economy, socialism of the 
German Zwangs~vimchaftpattern, is substituted for the market 
economy. The consumers no longer direct production by their buying 
and abstention from buying; the government alone directs it. 

There are only two exceptions to the rule that maximum prices 
restrict supply and thus bring about a state of affairs which is contrary 
to the ai~ns sought by their imposition. One refers to absolute rent, 
the other to monopoly prices. 

The maximum price results in a restriction of supply because the 
marginal producers suffer losses and must discontinue production. 
The nonspecific factors of production are employed for the produc- 
tion of other products not subject to price ceilings. The utilization of 
the absolutely specific factors of production shrinks. Under un-
hampered market conditions they would have been utilized up to the 
limit determined by the absence of an opportunity to use the non- 
specific among the complementary factors for the satisfaction of more 
urgent wants. Now only a smaller part of the available supply of these 
absolutely specific factors can be utilized; concomitantly that part of 
the supply that remains unused increases. But if the supply of these ab- 
solutely specific factors is so scanty that under the prices of the un- 
hampered market their total supply was utilized, a margin is given 
within which the government's interference does not curtail the 
supply of the product. The maximum price does not restrict produc- 
tion as long as it has not entirely absorbed the absolute rent of the 
marginal supplier of the absolutely specific factor. But at any rate it 
results in a discrepancy between the demand for and the supply of 
the product. 

Thus the amount by which the urban rent of a piece of land exceeds 
the agricuiturai rent provides a margin in which rent control can 
operate without restricting the supply of rental space. If the maximum 
rents are graduated in such a way as never to take away from any 
proprietor so much that he prefers to use the land for agriculture 
rather than for the construction of buildings, they do not affect the 
supply of apartments and business premises. However, they increase 
the demand for such apartments and premises and thus create the 
very shortage that the governments pretend to fight by their rent 
ceilings. Whether or not the authorities resort to rationing the space 
availabIe is catallacticalIy of minor importance. At any rate, their 


Human Action 
price ceilings do not abolish the catallactic phenomenon of the urban 
rent. They merely transfer the rcnt from the landlord's income into 
the tenant's income. 
In practice, of course, governments resorting to rent restriction 
never adjust their ceilings to these considerations. They either rigidly 
freeze gross rents as they prevailed on the eve of their interference or 
allow only a lirnited addition to these gross rents. As the proportion 
between the two items included in the gross rent, urban rent proper 
and price paid for thc utilization of the superstructure, varies accord- 
ing to the special circumstances of each dwelling, the effect of the 
rent ceilings is also very different. In some cases the expropriation of 
the owner to the benefit of the renter involves only a fraction of the 
difference between the urban rcnt and the agricultural rent; in other 
cases it far cxceeds this difference. But however this may be, the 
rent restriction creates a housing shortage. It increases demand without 
increasing supply. 
If maximum rents are decreed not only for already available rental 
spacc, but also for buildings still to be constructed, the construction 
of new buildings is no longer remunerative. It either stops altogether 
or slumps to a low level; the shortage is perpetuated. But even if rents 
in new buildings are left free, construction of new buildings drops. 
Prospective investors are deterred because they cake into account the 
danger that the government will at a later date declare a new emer- 
gcncy and expropriate a part of their revenues in the same way as it 
did with the old buildings. 
The second exception refers to monopoly prices. The difference 
between a monopoIy price and the competitive price of the com-
modity in question provides a margin in which maximum prices could 
be enforced without defeating the ends sought by the government. If 
the competitive pricc is p and the lowest among the possible monopoly 
prices nz) a ceiling price of c, c being lower than m,would make it 
disadvantageous for the seller to raisc the price above p. The maximum 
price would reescabiish the competitive pricc and increase demand, 
production, and the supply offered for sale. A dim cognizance of this 
concatenation is at the bottom of some suggcstions asking for govern- 
ment interference in order to preserve co~npetition and to make it 
operate as beneficially as possible. 
We may for the sake of argument pass over the fact that all such 
proposals are unrealistic with regard to all those instances of rnonopoly 
prices which are the outcome of government interference. If the 
government objccts to monopoly prices for ncw inventions, it should 
stop granting patents, It would be absurd to grant patents and then 


Interference with the Stmcture of Prices 

761 

to deprive them of any value by forcing the patentee to sell at the 
competitive price. If the government does not approve of cartels, 
it should rather abstain from all measures (such as import duties) 
which provide business with the opportunity to erect combines. 

Things arc ditferent in those instances in which monopoly prices 
come into existence without assistance from the governments. Here 
governmental maximum priccs could reestablish competitive condi- 
tions if it were possible to find out by academic computation at which 
height a nonexisting competitive marlict would have determined the 
price. That all endeavors to construct normarket prices are vain has 
heen shown.' The unsatisfactory results of all attempts to determine 
urhat the fair or correct price for the services of public utilities should 
be are well known to all experts. 

Reference to these two exceptions explains why in some rare cases 
maximum prices, when applied with very great caution within a nar- 
I-owmargin, do not restrict thc supply of the oornmodity or the service 
concerned. It does not affect the correctness of the general rule that 
maximum prices bring about a state of affairs which, from the point 
of view of the government decreeing them, is more undesirable than 
conditions as they would have been in the abscnce of price control. 

Observations on the Causes of the Decline of Ancient Civilization 

Knowledge of the effects of government interference with market prices 
makes us comprehend the economic causes of a momentous historical 
event, the decline of ancient civilization. 

It may be Ieft undecided whether or not it is correct to call the economic 
organization of the Roman Empire capitalism. At any rate it is certain 
that the Roman Empire in the second century, the age of the Antonines, 
the "good" emperors, had reachcd a high stage of the social division of 
labor and of interregional commerce. Several metropolitan centers, a 
considerable number of middle-sized towns, and many small towns were 
the seats of a refined civilization. The inhabitants of these urban agglomera- 
tions were supplied with food and raw materials not onIy from the 
neighboring rural districts, but also from distant provinces. A part of 
these provisions flowed into the cities as revenue of their wealthy residents 
who owned landed property. But a considerable part u7as bought in ex- 
change for the rural population's purchases of the products of the city- 
dwellers' processing activities. There was an extensive trade between the 
various regions of the vast empire. Not only in the processing industries, 
but also in agricuiture there was a tendency toward further specialization. 
The various parts of the empire were no longer econon~ically self-suffici- 
ent. They were mutually interdependent. 

What brought about the decline of the empire and the decay of its 

2. Cf. above, pp. 392-394. 

Human Action 

civilization was the disintegration of this econonlic interconnectedness, 
not the barbarian invasions. The alien aggressors merely took advantage 
of an opportunity which the internal weakness of the empire offered to 
them. From a military point of view the tribes which invaded the empire 
in the fourth and fifth centuries were not more formidable than the 
armies which the legions had easily defeated in earlier times. But the 
empire had changed. Its economic and social structure was already 
medieval. 

The freedom that Rome granted to commerce and trade had always 
been restricted. With regard to the marketing of cereals and other vital 
necessities it was even more restricted than with regard to other commodi- 
ties. It was deemed unfair and immoral to ask for grain, oil, and wine, the 
staples of these ages, more than the customary prices, and the municipal 
authorities were quick to check what they considered profiteering. Thus 
the evolution of an eficient wholesale trade in these commodities was pre- 
vented. The policy of the annonn, which was tantamount to a nationaliza- 
tion or municipalization qf the grain trade, aimed at filling the gaps. But 
its effects were rather unsatisfactory. Grain was scarce in the urban ag- 
glomerations, and the agriculturists complained about the unremunerative- 
ness of grain gro~ing.~ 

The interference of the authorities upset the ad- 
justment of supply to the rising demand. 

The showdown came when in the political troubles of the third and 
fourth centuries the emperors resorted to currency debasement. With 
the system of maximum prices the practice of debasement completely 
paralyzed both the production and the marketing of the vital foodstuffs 
and disintegrated society's economic organization. The more eagerness the 
authorities displayed in enforcing the maximum prices, the more desperate 
became the conditions of the urban masses dependent on the purchase of 
food. Commerce in grain and other necessities vanished altogether. To 
avoid starving, people deserted the cities, settled on the countryside, and 
tried to grow grain, oil, wine, and other necessities for thcmselvcs. On the 
other hand, the owners of the big estates restricted their excess production 
of cereals and began to produce in their farmhouses-the villae-the prod-
ucts of handicraft which they needed. For their big-scale farming, which 
was already serio~lsly jeopardized hecause of the Inefficiency of slave 
labor, lost its rationality completely when the opportunity to sell at re- 
munerative prices disappeared. As the owner of the estate could no longer 
seIl in the cities, he could no longer patronize the urban artisans either. 
He was forced to look for a substitute to meet his needs by employing 
handicraftsmen on his own account in his villa. He discontinued big-scale 
farming and became a landlord receiving rents from tenants or share- 
croppers. These coloni were either freed slaves or urban proletarians who 
settled in the villages and turned to tilling the soil. A tendency toward the 
establishment of autarky of each landlord's estate emerged. The cconomic

Interference with the Structure of Prices 

function of the cities, of commerce, trade, and urban handicrafts, shrank. 
Italy and the provinces of the empire returned to a less advanced state of 
the social division of labor. The highly developed economic structure of 
ancient civilization retrograded to what is now known as the manorial 
organization of the Middle Ages. 

The emperors were alarmed with that outcome, which undermined the 
financial and military power of their government. But their counteraction 
was futile as it did not affect the root of the evil. The compulsion and 
coercion to which they resorted could not reverse the trend toward social 
disintegration which, on the contrary, was caused precisely by too much 
compulsion and coercion. No Roman was aware of the fact that the process 
was induccd by the government's interference with prices and by cur- 
rency debasement. It was vain for the emperors to promulgate laws 
against the city-dweller who "relicta chitate rus habitare maluerit." The 
system of the leiturgia, the public services to be rendered by the wealthy 
citizens, only accelerated the retrogression of the division of labor. The 
laws concerning the special obligations of the shipowners, the navicularii, 
were no more successful in checking the decline of navigation than thc 
laws concerning grain dealing in checking the shrinkage in the cities' 
supply of agricultural products. 

The marvelous civilization of antiquity perished because it did not adjust 
its moral code and its legal system to the requirements of the market 
economy. A social order is doomed if the actions which its normal func- 
tioning rcquires are rejected by the standards of morality, are dedared 
iI1egal by the laws of the country, and are prosecuted as criminal by the 
courts and the police. The Roman Etnpire crumbled to dust because it 
lacked the spirit of liberalism and free enterprise. The policy of interven- 
tionism and its political corollary, the Fiihrer principle, decomposed the 
mighty empire as they will by necessity always disintegrate and destroy 
any social entity. 

3. Minimum Wage Rates 
The very essence of the interventionist politicians' wisdom is to 
raise the price of labor either by government decree or b\; violent 
action on the part of labor unions. To raise wage rates above the 
height at which the unhampered market would determine them is 
considered a postulate of the eternal laws of morality as well as indis- 
pensable from the economic point of view. ~hoe;er dares to chal- 
lenge this ethicaI and economic dogma is scorned both as depraved 
and ignorant. Man\; of our contemporaries look upon people who 
are foolhardy cnouih "to cross a picket line" as primitive tribesmen 
looked upon those who violated the precepts of taboo conceptions.

ment from the hands of the strikers while the police, the public 
attorneys, and the penal courts preserve a lofty neutrality. 

The market wage rate tends toward a height at which all those eager 
to earn wages get jobs and all those eager to employ workers can hire 
as many as they want. It tends toward the cstablishnlent of what is 
nowadays called full employment. Whcrc there is neither govern- 
ment nor union interfercncc with the lal~or market, there is only 
voluntary or catallactic unemployment. But as soon as external pres- 
sure and cornpulsion, be it on the part of the government or on the 
part of the unions, tries to fix wage rates at a higher point,institutional 
unemployment emerges. While there prcvails on the unhampered 
labor market a tcndcncy for catallactic unemployment to disappear, 
institutional unemployment cannot disappear as long as the govern- 
ment or the unions arc successful in the enforcement of their fiat. 
If the minimum wage rate refers only to a part of the various occupa- 
tions while other sectors of the labor market arc left free, those 
losing thcir jobs on its account enter the free branches of business 
and increase the supply of labor in them. When unionism was re- 
stricted to skilled labop mainly, the wage rise achieved by the unions 
did not lead to institutional unemployment. It merely lowered the 
height of wage rates in those branches in which there were no efficient 
unions or no unions at all. 'The corollary of the rise in wages for or- 
ganized workers was a drop in wages for unorganized workers. But 
with the spread of govcrnment intcrfcrcnce with wages and with 
government support of unionism, conditions have changed. Institu- 
tional unenlployment has become a chronic or permanent mass 
phenomcnon. 

Writing in 1930. T,ord Beveridge, now an enthusiastic advocate of 
government and union mccldling with the labor market, pointed out 
that the potential effect of "a high-wages policy" in causing unem- 
pIoyment is "not dcnied by any competent authority." "n fact, to 
denv this cffcct is tantamount to a complete disavowal of any regular- 
ity ;n the sequence and interconnectcdncss of market phenomena. 
Those earlier economists who sympathized with the unions were fully 
aware of the fact that unionization can achieve its ends only when 
rcstricted to a minority of worlters. They approved of unionism as 
a device bcneficial to the group interests of a privileged labor aris- 
tocracv, and did not concern thcrnselves about its consequences for 
the rest of the wage ~arncrs.~

to demonstrate that unionism could improve the conditions and raise 
the standard of living of all those eager to earn wages. 

It is important to remember also that Karl Marx did not contend 
that unions could raise the average standard of wages. As he saw it, 
"the general tendency of capitalistic production is not to raise, but 
to sink the average standard of wages." Such being the tendency of 
things, all that unionism can achieve with regard to wages is "making 
the best of the occasional chances for their temporary improve- 
ment." * The unions counted for Marx only as far as they attacked 
"the very system of wage slavery and present-day methods of produc- 
tion." * They should understand that "instead of the conservative 
motto, A fair day's wages for n fair day's work! they ought to inscribe 
on their banner the revolutionary watchword, ~bdlitionof the wages 
system." Tonsistent Marxiam always opposed atrempts to impose 
minimum wage rates as detrimental to the interests of the whole labor 
class. From the beginning of the modern labor movement there was 
always an antagonism between the unions and the revolutionary so- 
cialists. The older British and American unions were exclusively 
dedicated to the enforcement of higher wage rates. They looked 
askance upon socialism, "utopian" as well as "scientific." In ~errnan~ 
there was a rivalry between the adepts of the Marxian creed and the 
union leaders. Finally, in the last decades preceding the outbreak of 
the first World War, the uniom triumphed. They virtually converted 
the Social Democratic Party to the principles of interventionism and 
unionism. In France, Georges Sore1 aimed at imbuing the unions with 
that spirit of ruthless aggression and revolutionary bellicosity which 
hlarx wanted to impart to them. There is today in every nonsocialist 
country a manifest conflict between two irreconcilabIe factions within 
the unions. One group considers unionism a device for the improve- 
ment of the workers' conditions within the frame of capitalism. The 
other group wants to drive the unions into the ranks of militant com- 
munism and approves of them only as far as they are the pioneers of a 
violent overthrow of the capitalistic system. 

The problems of labor unionism have been obfuscated and utterly 
confused by pseudo-humanitarian blather. The advocates of minimum 
wage rates, whether decreed and enforced by the government or by 
violent union action, contend that they are fighting for the improve- 
ment of the conditions of the working masses. They do not permit 
anyone to question their dogma that minimum wage rates are the

only appropriate means of raising wage rates permanently and for 
all those eager to earn wages. They pride themselves on being the only 
true friends of "labor," of the "common man," of "progress," and 
of the eternal principles of "social justice." 

However, the problem is precisely whether there is any means for 
raising the standard of living of all those eager to work other than 
raising the marginal productivity of labor by accelerating the increase 
of capital as compared with population. The union doctrinaires are 
intent upon obscuring this primary issue. They never refer to the 
only point that matters, viz., the relation between the number of 
workers and the quantity of capital goods available. But certain 
policies of the unions involve a tacit acltnow-ledgmcnt of the cor- 
rectness of the catallactic theorems concerning the determination of 
wage rates. Unions are anxious to cut down the supply of labor by 
anti-immigration laws and by preventing outsiders and newcomers 
from competing in the unionized sectors of the labor market. They 
are opposed to the export of capital. These policies would be non- 
sensicaI if it were true that the per capita quota of capital available 
is of no importance for determination of wage rates. 

The essence of the union doctrine is implied in the slogan exploita- 

tion. According to the union variety of the exploitation doctrine, 

which differs in some points from the Marxian creed, labor is the only 

source of wealth, and expenditure of labor the only real costs. By 

rights, all proceeds from the sale of products should belong to the 

workers. The worker has a fair claim to the whole produce of labor. 

The wrong that the capitalistic mode of production does to the worker 

consists in the fact that it permits landowners, capitalists, and entre- 

preneurs to withhold a part of the workers' portion. The share which 

goes to these parasites is unearned income. It is manifestly a predatory 

revenue, a theft. The workers are right in their endeavors to raise 

wage rates step by step to such a height that finally nothing will be 

left for the support of a class of idle and socially useless exploiters. 

in aiming at this end, they continue the battie whlch earlier genera- 

tions fought for the emancipation of slaves and serfs and for the aboli- 

tion of the imposts, tributes, tithes, and unpaid statute labor with 

which the peasantry was burdened for the benefit of aristocratic 

landlords. The labor movement is a struggle for freedom and equality, 

and for the vindication of the inalienable rights of man. Its ultimate 

victory is beyond doubt, for it is the inevitable trend of historical 

evolution to wipe out all class privileges and to establish firmly the 

realm of freedom and equality. The attempts of reactionary employ- 

ers to halt progress are doomed. 


Interference with the Swucture of Prices 

Such are the tenets of present-day social doctrine. It is true that 
some people, although in perfect agreement with its philosophical 
ideas, support the practical conclusions derived by the radicals only 
wirh certain reservations and qualifications. Thesc moderates do not 
propose to abolish "management's" share alcogcther; they would be 
satisfied with cutting it down to a "fair" amount. As the opinions 
concerning the fairness of the revenues of the entreprcneurs and 
capitalists vary widely, the difference betwcen the point of view of 
the radicals and that of the moderates is of little moment. The moder- 
ates also endorse the principle that real wage rates should always rise 
and never drop. In both world wars few voices in the United Statcs 
disputed the claim of the unions that the wage earners' take-home 
pay, even in a national emergency, should go up faster than the cost 
of living. 

All these sentimental disquisitions leave out of consideration the 
problems that mattcr, viz., the economic aspects of the issue. They 
take no notice of institutional unemployment, the inescapable result 
of raising wage rates above the height determincd by the unhampercd 
market. 

As the union doctrine sees it, there is no harm in confiscating the 
specific revenue of the capitalists and entrepreneurs partially or alto- 
gether. In dealing with this issue they speak of profits in the sense in 
which the classical economists applied this term. They do not distin- 
guish between entrepreneurial profit, interest on the capital employed, 
and compensation for the technical services rendered by the entre- 
preneur. We will deal later with the consequences resulthg from the 
confiscation of interest and profits and with the syndicalist elements 
involved in the "ability to pay" principle and in profit-sharing 
schemes.1° We have examined the purchasing power argument as 
advanced in favor of a policy of raising wage rates above the potential 
market rates.ll What remains is to scrutinize thc purport of the alleged 
Ricardo effect. 

Ricardo is the author of the proposition that a rise in wages wiIl 

encourage capitalists to substitute machinery for labor and vice versa.'" 

Hence, concludc the union apologists, a of raising wage rates, 

irrespective of what thcy would have been on the unhampercd labor 

market, is always beneficial. It gencratcs technological improvement 

and raises thc productivity of labor. Higher wages always pay for

themselves. In forcing the reluctant employers to raise wage rates, 
the unions become the pioneers of progress and prosperity. 

Many economists approve of the Ricardian proposition although 
few of them are consistent enough to endorse the inference the union 
apologists draw from it. The Ricardo effect is by and large a stock-
in-trade of popular economics. Nonetheless, the theorem involved is 
one of the worst economic fallacies. 

The confusion starts with the misinterpretation of the statement 
that machinery is "substituted" for labor. What happens is that labor 
is rendered more efficient by the aid of machinery. The same input 
of labor leads to a greater quantity or a better quality of products. 
The employment of machinery itself does not directly result in a 
reduction df the number of hands employed in the production of 
the article A concerned. What brings about this secondary effect is 
the fact that-other things being equal-an increase in the available 
supply of A lowers the marginal utility of a unit of A as against that 
of the units of other articles and that therefore labor is withdrawn 
from the production of A and employed in the turning out of other 
articles. The technological improvement in the production of A makes 
it possible to realize certain projects which could not be executed be- 
fore because the workers required were employed for the production 
of A for which consumers7 demand was more urgent. The reduction 
of the number of workers in the A industry is caused by the increased 
demand of these other branches to which the opportunity to expand 
is offered. Incidentally, this insight explodes all talk about "technologi- 
cal unemployment." 

Tools and machinery are primarily not labor-saving devices, but 
means to increase output per unit of input. They appear as labor- 
saving devices if looked upon exclusivcly from the point of view of 
the individual branch of business concerned. Seen from the point of 
view of the consumers and the whole of society, they appear as instru- 
ments that raise the productivity of human effort. They increase 
supp!j. aiid make it possible to comiiiiie more n~atclrial and to 
enjoy more leisure. Which goods will bc consumed in greater quantity 
and to what extent people will prefer to enjoy more leisure depends on 
people's value judgments. 

The employment of more and better tools is feasible only to the 
extent that the capital required is available. Saving-that is, a surplus 
of production over consumption-is the indispensable condition of 
every further step toward technological improvement. Mere techno- 
logicaI knowledge is of no use if the capita1 needed is lacking. Chinese 


Interference mitt3 the Structure of Prices 

businessmen are familiar with American ways of production. What 
prevents them from adopting the American mcthods is not the low-
ness of Chinese wages, but lack of capital. 

On the other hand, capitalist saving necessarily causes employment 
of additional tools and machinery. The role that plain saving, i.e., the 
piling up of stocks of consumers' goods as a reserve for rainy days, 
plays in the market economy is negligible. Under capitalism saving is 
as a rule capitalist saving. The excess of production over consumption 
is invested either directly in the saver's own business or farm or in- 
directly in othcr ~eo~lcs' 

enterprises through the instrumentality of 
savings deposits, common and preferred stock, bonds, debentures, and 
mortgages.'To the extent to which people keep their consumption 
below their net income, additional capital is created and at the same 
timc crnploved for thc expansion of the capital equipment of the 
apparatus of production. As has been pointed out, this outcome can- 
not be affected by any synchronous tendency toward an increase in 
cash holdings.14 On one hand, what is unconditionally needed for the 
employment of more and better tools is additional accumulation of 
capital. On the other hand, there is no employment available for 
additional capital other than that provided by the application of more 
and better tools. 

Ricardo's proposition and the union doctrinc derived from it turn 
things upside down. A tendency toward higher wage rates is not 
the cause, but thc effect, of technological improvement. Profit-seeking 
business is compelled to employ the most efficient methods of produc- 
tion. What checks a businessman's endeavors to improve the equip- 
ment of his firm is only lack of capital. If the capital rcquired is not 
available, no meddling with wage rates can provide it. 

All that minimum wage rates can accomplish with regard to the 
einployment of machinery is to shift additional investment from one 
hranch into another. T,et us assume that in an cconornically backward 
country, Ruritania, the stevedores' union succeeds in forcing the 
entrcprencurs to pay wage rates which are comparatively much higher 
than those paid in the rest of the country's industries. Then it may 
result that the most profitable employment for additional capital is 
to utilize mechanical devices in the 1bading and unloading of ships. 
But the capital thus employed is withheld from other branchcs of 
Ruritania's business in which, in the absence of the union's policy, 

13. .4s we are dealing here with the conditions of the unhampered market econ- 
omy, we may disregard the capital-consuming effects of government borrowing.

it would have been employed in a more profitable way. The effect of 
the high wages of the stevedores is not an increase, but a drop in 
Ruritania's total production.'" 
Real wage rates can rise only to the extent that, other things being 
equal, capital becomes more plentiful. If the government or the 
unions succeed in enforcing wage rates which are higher than those 
the unhampered labor market would have determined, the supply 
of labor exceeds the denland for labor. Institutional unen~ployment 
emerges. 
Firmly committed to the principles of interventionism, govern- 
ments try to check this undesired resuIt of their interference by re- 
sorting to those measures which arc nowadays called full-ernploymcnt 
policy: unemployment doles, arbitration of labor disputes: public 
worlts by means of lavish public spending, inflation, and credit ex- 
pansion. A11 these remedies are worse than the evil they are designed 
to remove. 
Assistance granted to the unemployed does not dispose of unem- 
ployment. It makes it easier for the unemployed to remain idle. The 
nearer the allowance comes to the height at which the unhampered 
markct would have fixed the wage rate, the less incentive it offers to 
the beneficiary to look for a new job. It is a means of making unem- 
ployment last rather than of malting it disappear. The disastrous 
financial implications of unemployment benefits are manifest. 
Arbitration is not an appropriate method for the settlement of 
disputes concerning the height of wage rates. If the arbitrators' award 
fixes wage rates exactly at the potential market rate or below that 
rate, it is supererogatorv. If it fixes wage ratcs above the potential 
market rate, the conseq;ences are the same that any other mode of 
fixing minimum wagc rates above the market height brings about, 
viz., institutional unemployment. It does not matter to what pretext 
the arbitrator resorts in order to justify his decision. What matters 
is not whether wages are "fair" or "unfair" by some arbitrary stand- 
ard, but whether they do or do not bring about an excess of suppi? 
of labor over demand for labor. It may seem fair to some people to 
fix wage rates at such a height that a great part of the potential labor 
force is doomed to lasting unemployment. But nobody can assert 
that it is expedient and beneficial to society. 
If government spending is financed by taxing the citizens or bor- 
rowing from them, the citizens' power to spend and invest is curtailed 

15. The example is merely hypothetical. Such a powerful union would prob- 
ably prohibit the employment of mechanical deviccs in the loading and unload- 
ing of ships in order to "create more jobs." 

lnte~ferencewith the Structure of Prices 

771 

to the same extent as that of the public treasury expands. No additional 
jobs are created. 

But if the government finances its spending program by inflation- 
by an increase in the quantity of money and by credit expansion-it: 
causes a general cash-induced rise in the prices of all commodities and 
services. If in the course of such an inflation the rise in wage rates 
sufficientiy lags behind the rise in the prices of commodities, institu- 
tional unemployment may shrink or disappear altogether. But what 
makes it shrink or disappear is precisely the fact that such an outcome 
is tantamount to a drop in real wage rates. Lord Keynes considered 
credit expansion an efficient method for the abolition of unemploy- 
ment; he believed that "gradual and automatic lowering of real wages 
as a result of rising prices" would not be so strongly resisted by labor 
as any attempt to lower money wage rates.l0 However, the success of 
such a cunning plan would require an unlikeIy degree of ignorance 
and stupidity on the part of the wage earners. As long as workers 
believe that minimum wage rates benefit them, they will not let them- 
selves be cheated by such clever tricks. 

In practice all these devices of an alleged full employment policy 
finally lead to the establishment of socialism of the German pattern. 
As the members of an arbitration court whom the employers have 
appointed and those whom the unions have appointed never agree 
with regard to the fairness of a definite rate, the decision virtually 
devolves upon the members appointed by the government. The power 
to determine the height of wage rates is thus vested in the government. 

The more public works expand and the more the government 

undertakes in order to fill the gap left by "private enterprise's in- 

ability to provide jobs for all," the more the realm of private enter- 

prise shrinks. Thus we are again faced with the alternative of capital- 

ism or socialism. There cannot be any question of a lasting policy of 

minimum wage rates. 

The Catalloctic Aspects of Labor Unionism 

The only catallactic problem with regard to labor unions is the question 

of whether or not it is possible to raise by pressure and compulsion the 

wage rates of a11 those eager to earn wages above the height the unham- 

pered market would have determined. 

In all countries the labor unions have actually acquired the privilege

(London, r936), p. 264. For a critical examination of this idea see Albert IIahn,

stratagem in the 'thirties, cf. below, pp. 786-787. 

Hunzan Action 

of violent action. The governments have abandoned in their favor the 
essential attribute of government, the exclusive power and right to resort 
to violent coercion and compulsion. Of course, the laws which make it a 
criminal offense for any citizen to resort-except in case of self-defense- 
to violent action have not been formally repealed or amended. However, 
actually labor union violence is tolerated within broad limits. The labor 
unions are practically free to prevent by force anybody from defying their 
orders concerning wage rates and other labor conditions. They are free to 
inflict with impunity bodily evils upon strikebreakers and upon entre- 
preneurs and mandataries of entrepreneurs who employ strikebreakers. 
They are free to destroy property of such employers and even to injure 
customers patronizing their shops. The authorities, with the approval of 
public opinion, condone such acts. The police do not stop such offenders, 
the state attorneys do not arraign them, and no opportunity is offered to 
the penal courts to pass judgment on their actions. In excessive cases, if 
the deeds of violence go too far, some lame and tinlid attempts at repres- 
sion and prevention are ventured. But as a rule they fail. Their failure is 
sometimes due to bureaucratic inefficiency or to the insufficiency of the 
means at the disposal of the authorities, but more often to the unwillingness 
of the whole governmental apparatus to interfere successfully. 

Such has been the state of affairs for a long tirne in all nonsocialist coun- 
tries. The economist in establishing these facts neither blames nor accuses. 
He merely explains what conditions have given to the unions the power ro 
enforce their minimum wage rates and what the real meaning of the term 
collective bargaining is. 

As union advocates explain the term collective bargaining, it merely 
means the substitution of a union's bargaining for the individual bargaining 
of the individual workers. In the fully developed market economy bargain- 
ing concerning those commodities and services of which homogeneous 
items are frequently bought and sold in great quantities is not effected by 
the manner in which nonfungible con~modities and services are traded. 
The buyer or seller of fungible consumers' goods or of fungible services 
fixes a price tentatively and adjusts it later according to the response his 
offer meets from those interested until he is in a position to buy or to sell as 
much as he plans. Technically no other procedure is feasible. The de- 
partment store cannot haggle with its patrons. It fixes the price of an article 
and waits. If the public does not buy sufficient quantities, it lowers the 
price. A factory that needs five hundred welders fixes a wage rate which, 
as it expects, will enable it to hire five hundred men. If only a minor num- 
ber turns up, it is forced to allow a higher rate. Every employer must raise 
the wages he offers up to the point at which no competitor Iures the 
workers away by overbidding. What makes the enforcement of minimum 
wage rates futile is precisely the fact that with wages raised above this 
point competitors do not turn up with a demand for labor big enough to 
absorb the whole supply. 

If the unions were really bargaining agencies, their collective bargain- 


Interference uith the Structure of Prices 

ing could not raise the height of wage rates above the point of the un- 
hampered market. As long as there still are unemployed workers available, 
there is no reason for an employer to raise his offer. Real collective bar- 
gaining would not differ cataIlactically from individual bargaining. It 
would, like individual bargaining, give a virtual voicc to those job-seekers 
who have not yet found the jobs they are Iooking for. 

However, what is euphemistically caIled collective bargaining by union 
leaders and "pro-labor" legislation is of a quite different character. It is 
bargaining at the point of a gun. It is bargaining between an armed party, 
ready to use its weapons, and an unarmed party under duress. It is not a 
market transaction. It is a dictate forced upon the employer. And its effects 
do not differ from those of a government decree for the enforcement of 
which the police power and the penal courts are used. It produces institu- 
tional unemployment. 

The treatment of the problems involved by public opinion and the vast 
number of pseudo-economic writings is utterly misleading. The issue is 
not the right to form associations. It is whether or not any association of 
private citizens should be granted the privilege of resorting with impunity 
to violent action. It is the same problem that relates to the activities of the 
Ku Klux Klan. 

hTeithcr is it correct to look upon the matter from the point of view of a 
"right to strike." The problem is not the right to strike, but the right-by 
intimidation or violence-to force other people to strike, and the further 
right to prevent anybody from working in a shop in which a union has 
caIled a strike. When the unions invoke the right to strike in justification 
of such intimidation and deeds of violence, they are on no better ground 
than a religious group would be in invoking the right of freedom of con- 
science as a justification of persecuting dissenters. 

When in the past the laws of some countries denied to employees the 
right to form unions, they were guided by the idea that such unions have 
no obj cctive other than to resort to violent action and intimidation. When 
the authorities in the past sometimes directed their armed forces to protect 
the employers, their mandataries, and their property against the onslaught 
of strikers, they were not guilty of acts hostile to "labor." They simply did 
what every government considers its main duty. They tried to preserve 
their exclusive right to rcsort to violent action. 

There is no need for economics to enter into an examination of the 

problems of jurisdictional strikes and of various laws, especially of the 

American New Deal, which wcre admittedly loaded against the em-

ployers and which assigned a privileged position to the unions. There is 

only one point that matters. If a government decree or labor union pressure 

and compulsion fix wage rates above the height of the potential market 

rates, institutional unemployment results. 


XXXI. CURREXCY AND CREDIT &IANIPULATION 
1. The Government and the Currency 
M 
M
EDIA of exchange and money are n~arltet phenomena. What 
makes a thing a medium of exchange or money is the conduct 
of parties to market transactions. An occasion for dealing with rnonc- 
tary problems appears to the authorities in the same way in which they 
concern themselves with all other objects exchanged, namely, when 
they are called upon to decide whether or not the failure of one of the 
parties to an act of exchange to comply with his contractual obliga- 
tions justifies compulsion on thc part of the government apparatus 
of violent oppression. If both parties discharge their mutual obliga- 
tions instantly and synchronously, as a rule no conflicts arisc which 
would induce one of the parties to apply to the judiciary. But if 
one or both parties' obligations are ten~porally deferred, it may happen 
that the courts are called to decide how the terms of the contract are 
to be complied with. If payment of a sum of money is involved, this 
implies the task of determining what meaning is to be attached to the 
monetary terms used in the contract. 

Thus it devolves upon the laws of the country and upon the courts 
to define what the parties to the contract had in mind when speaking 
of a sum of money and to establish how the obligation to pay such a 
sum is to be settled in accordance with the terms agreed upon. They 
have to determine what is and what is not legal tender. In attending 
to this task the laws and the courts do not create money. A thing be- 
comes money only by virtue of the fact that those exchanging con+ 
n~odities and services commonly use it as a medium of exchange. in 
the unhampered market economy the laws and the judges in attribut- 
ing legal tender quality to a certain thing merely establish what, ac- 
cording to the usages of trade, was intended by the parties when they 
referred in their deal to a definite kind of money. They interpret the 
customs of the trade in the same way in which they proceed when 
called to determine what is the meaning of any other terms used in 
contracts. 

Mintage has long been a prerogative of the rulers of the country. 
However, this government activity had originally no objective other 


Currency and Credit Manipulation 

775 

than the stamping and certifying of weights and measures. The author- 
ity's stamp placed upon a piece of metal was supposed to certify its 
weight and fineness. When later princes resorted to substituting baser 
and cheaper metals for a part of the precious metals while retaining 
the customary face and name of the coins, they did it furtively and 
in full awareness of the fact that they were engaged in a fraudulent 
attempt to cheat the public. As soon as people found out these artifices, 
the debased coins were dealt with at a discount as against the old 
better ones. The governments reacted by resorting to compulsion 
and coercion. They made it illegal to discriminate in trade and in the 
settlement of deferred payments between "good" money and "bad" 
money and decreed maximum prices in terms of "bad" money. How- 
ever, the result obtained was not that which the governmcnts aimed at. 
Their decrees failed to stop the process which adjusted commodity 
prices (in terms of the debased currency) to the actual state of the 
money relation. Moreover, the effects appeared which Gresham's 
Law describes. 

The history of government interfercnce with currency is, however, 
not merely a record of debasement practices and of abortive attempts 
to avoid their inescapable catallactic consequences. There were 
governments that did not look upon their mintage prerogative as a 
means of cheating that part of the public who placed confidence in 
their rulers' integrity and who, out of ignorance, were ready to accept 
the debased coins at their face value. These governments considered 
the manufacturing of coins pot as 3 source of surreptitious fiscal lucre 
but as a public service designed to safeguard a smooth functioning of 
the market. But even these governments-out of ignorance and dilet- 
tantism-often resorted to measures which were tantamount to inter- 
ference with the price structure, although they were not deliberately 
planned as such. As two precious mctals wek used side by side as 
money, the authorities nai'vely hclieved that it was their task to unify 
the currency system by decreeing a rigid exchange ratio between 
gold and silver. The bimetallic system proved a complete failure. 
It did not bring about bimetallism, but an alternating standard. That 
metaI which, compared with the instantaneous state of the fluctuating 
market exchange rate between gold and silver, was overvalued in 
the legally fixed ratio, predominated in domestic circulation, while 
the other mctal disappeared. Finally the governincnts abandoned their 
vain attempts and acquiesced to monometallism. The present silver 
purchase policy of the American Government is not seriously a device 
of monetary policy. It is merely a device for raising the price of 
silver for the benefit of the owners of silver mines, their employees, 


Human Action 

and the states within whose boundaries the mines are located. It is 
a hardly disguised subsidy. Its monetary significance consists ex-
clusively in the fact that it is financed by issuing additional dollar 
notes whose legal tender quality does not differ essentially from that 
of the Federal Reserve notes, although they bear the practically mean- 
ingless imprint "Silver Certificate." 

Yet economic history also provides instances of well-designed and 
successful monetary policies on the part of governments whose only 
intention was to equip their countries with a smoothly working cur- 
rency system. Laissez-faire liberalism did not abolish the traditional 
government prerogative of mintage. But in the hands of the liberal 
governments the character of this state monopoly was completely 
altered. The ideas which considered it an instrument of interven- 
tionist policies were discarded. No longer was it used for fiscal pur- 
poses or for favoring some groups of the people at the expense of 
other groups. The government's monetary activities aimed at one 
objective only: to facilitate and to simplify the use of the medium of 
exchange which the conduct of the people had made money. A na-
tion's currency system, it was agreed, should be sound. The principle 
of soundness meant that the standard coins-ix., those to which 
unlimited legal tender power was assigned by the laws-should be 
properly assayed and stamped bars of bullion coined in such a way 
as to make the detection of clipping, abrasion, and counterfeiting 
easy. To the government's stamp no function was attributed other 
than to certify the weight and the fineness of the metal contained. 
Pieces worn by usage or in any other way reduced in weight beyond 
the very narrow limits of tolerated allowance lost their legal tender 
quality; the authorities themselves withdrew such pieces from cir- 
culation and reminted them. For the receiver of an undefaced coin 
there was no need to resort to the scales and to the melting pot in 
order to know its weight and content. On the other hand, individuals 
were entitled to bring bullion to the mint and to have it transformed 
into standard coins either free of charge or against payment of a 
seigniorage generally not surpassing the actual expenses of the proc- 
ess. Thus the various national currencies became genuine gold cur- 
rencies. Stability in the exchange ratio between the domestic legal 
tender and that of all other countries which had adopted the same 
principles of sound money was thus brought about. The international 
gold standard came into being without intergovernmental treaties 
and institutions. 

In many countries the emergence of the gold standard was effected 
by the operation of Gresham's Law. The role that government pol- 


Crarency a~zdC~editManipulation 

icies played in the process in Great Britain consisted merely in rati- 

fying thc results brought about by the operation of Gresham's Law; 

it transformed a de facto state of affairs into a legal state. In other 

countries the governments deliberately abandoned bimetalIism just 

at the moment when the change in the market ratio between gold 

and silver would have brought about a substitution of a de facto silver 

currency for the then prevailing de facto gold currency. With all 

these nations the formal adoption of the gold standard required no 

other contribution on the part of the administration and the legisla- 

ture than the enactment of laws. 

It was different in those countries which wanted to substitute the 
gold standard for a-de fact0 or dc jure-silver or paper currency. 
When the German Reich in the 'seventies of the nineteenth century 
wanted to adopt the gold standard, the nation's currency was silver. 
It could not realize its plan by simply imitating the procedure of 
those countries in which the enactment of the gold standard was 
merely a ratification of the actual state of affairs. It had to exchange 
'the silver standard coins in the hands of the public against gold coins. 
This was a time-absorbing and complicated financial operation in- 
volving vast government of gold and sales of silver. Con- 
ditions were similar in those countries which aimed at the substitution 

of gold for credit money or fiat money. 

It is important to realize these facts because they illustrate the dif- 

ference between conditions as they prevailed in the liberal age and 

those prevailing today in the age of interventionism. 

2. The Interventionist Aspect of Legal Tender Legislation 
The simplest and oldest variety of monetary interventionism is 

debasement of coins or diminution of their weight or size for the 

sake of debt abatement. The authority assigns to the cheaper cur- 

rency full legal tender power. All deferred payments can be legally 

discharged by payment of the amount due in the meaner coins ac- 

cording to their face vglue. Debtors are favored at the expense of 

creditors. But at the same time future credit transactions are made 

more onerous for debtors. A tendency for gross market rates of 

interest to rise ensues as the parties take into account the chances for 

a repetition of such measures of debt abatement. While debt abate- 

ment improves the conditions of those who were already indebted at 

the moment, it impairs the position of those eager or obliged to con- 

tract new debts. 

The antitype of debt abatement-debt aggravation through mone- 

tary measures-has also been practiced, though rarely. However, it 


7 78 Human Action 
has never deliberately been planned as a device to favor the creditors 
at the expense of the debtors. Whenever it came to pass, it was the 
unintentional effect of monetary changes considered as peremptory 
from other points of view. In resorting to such monetary changes 
governments put up with their effects upon deferred payments either 
because they considered the measures unavoidable or because they 
assumed that creditors and debtors, in determining the terms of the 
contract, had already foreseen these changes and duly taken them 
into account. The best examples are provided by British events after 
the Napoleonic wars and again after the first World War. In both 
illstances Great Britain some time after the end of hostilities returned, 
by means of a deflationary policy, to the prewar gold parity of the 
pound sterling. The idea of engineering the substitution of the gold 
standard for the war-time credit-money standard by acquiescing in 
the change in the market exchange ratio between the pound and gold, 
which had already taken place, and of adopting this ratio as the new 
legal parity, was rejected. This second alternative was scorned as a 
kind of national bankruptcy, as a partial repudiation of the public 
debt, and as a malicious infringement upon the rights of all those 
whose claims had originated in the period preceding the suspension 
of the unconditional convertibility of the banknotes of the Bank 
of England. People labored under the delusion that the evils caused 
by inflation could be cured by a subsequent deflation. Yet the return 
to the prewar gold parity could not indemnify the creditors for the 
damage they had suffered as far as the debtors had repaid their old 
debts during the period of money depreciation. Moreover, it was a 
boon to all those who had lent during this period and a bIow to all 
those who had borrowed. But the statesmen who were responsible 
for the deflationary policy were not aware of the import of their 
action. They failed to see consequences which were, even in their 
eyes, undesirable, and if they had recognized them in time, they 
would not have known how to avoid them. Their conduct of affairs 
really favored the creditors at the expense of the debtors, especially 
the holders of the government bonds at the expense of the taxpayers. 
In thc 'twenties of the nineteenth century it aggravated seriously 
the distress of British agriculture and a h~mdred years later the plight 
of British export trade. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to call 
these two British monetary reforms the consummation of an inter-
ventionism intentionally aiming at debt aggravation. Debt aggrava- 
tion was merely an attending phenomenon of a policy aiming at 
other ends. 
Whenever debt abatement is resorted to, its authors protest that 


Currency and Credit Manipulation 

the measure will never be repeated. They emphasize that extraordi- 
nary conditions which will never again present themselves have 
created an emergency which makes indispensable recourse to noxious 
devices, absoIutely reprehensible under any other circumstances. 
Once and never again, they declare. It is easy to conceive why the 
authors and supporters of debt abatement are compelled to hake 
such promises. If total or partial nullification of the creditors' claims 
1)ecomes a regular policy, lending of money will stop altogether. 
'The stipulation of deferred payments depends on the expectation that 
no such nulIification will be decreed. 

It is therefore not permissible to look upon debt abatement as a 
device of a system of economic policies which could be considered 
as an alternative to any other system of society's permanent economic 
organization. It is by no means a tool of constructive action. It is a 
bomb that destroys and can do nothing but destroy. If it is applied 
only once, a reconstruction of the shattered credit system is still 
possible. But if the blows are repeated, total destruction results. 

It is not correct to look upon inflation and deflation exclusively 
from the point of view of their eff ects upon deferred payments. It has 
been shown that cash-induced changes in purchasing power do not 
affect the prices of the various commodities and services at the same 
time and to the same extent, and what role this unevenness plays in 
the market.l But if one regards inflation and deflation as means 
of rearranging the relations between creditors and debtors, one can- 
not fail to reaIize that the ends sought by the government resorting 
to them are attained only in a very imperfect degree and that, be- 
sides, consequences appear which, from the government's point of 
view, are highly unsatisfactory. As is the case with every other 
variety of government interference with the price structure, the re- 
sults obtained not only are contrary to the intentions of the govern- 
ment but produce a state of affairs which, in the opinion of the gov- 
ernment, is more undesirable than conditions on the unhampered 
market. 

As far as a government resorts to inflation in order to favor the 
debtors at the expense of the creditors, it succeeds only with regard 
to those deferred payments which were stipulated before. Inflaticjn 
does not make it cheaper to contract new loans; it makes it, on the 
contrary, more expensive by the appearance of a positive price 
premium. If inflation is pushed to its ultimate consequences, it makes 
any stipulation of deferred payments in terms of the inflated cur- 
rency cease altogether.

3. The Evolution of Modern Methods of Currency 
Manipulation 
A metallic currency is not subject to government manipulation. 
Of course, the government has the power to enact legal tender laws. 
But then the operation of Gresham's Law brings about results which 
may frustrate the aims sought by the government. Seen from this 
point of view, a metallic standard appears as an obstacle to all at- 
tempts to interfere with the nlarkct phenomena by monetary policies. 

In examining the evolution which gave governments the power 
to manipulate their national currcncy systems, we must begin by 
mentioning one of the most serious shortcomings of the classical 
economists. Both Adam Smith and David Ricardo looked upon the 
costs involved in the preservation of a metallic currency as a waste. 
As they saw it, the substitution of paper money for m&allic money 
tvould make it possible to employ capital and labor, required for the 
production of the quantity of gold and silver needed for monetary 
purposes, for the production of goods which could dircctly satisfy 
human wants. Starting from this assumption, Ricardo elaborated his 
famous Proposals for an Economical arzd Secure CZWI-ency, first pub- 
lished in I 816. Ricardo's plan fell into oblivion. It was not until many 
decades after his death that several countries adopted its basic prin- 
ciples under the label gold exchange standard in ordcr to reduce the 
alleged waste involved in the operation of the gold standard now- 
adays decried as "classical" or "orthodox." 

Under the classical gold standard a part of the cash holdings of 
individuals consists in gold coins. Under the gold exchange standard 
the cash holdings of individuals consist entirely in money-substitutes. 
These money-substitutes arc redeemable at the legal par in gold or 
foreign exchange of countries under the gold standnrd or the gold 
exchange standard. But the arrangement of monetary and banking 
institutions aims at preventing thc public from withdrawing gold 
from he Ccnrrai Iiank for domestic cash hoidings. Tne first objecii\.c 
of redemption is to secure the stability of foreign exchange rates. 

In dealing with the problems of the gold exchange standard all 
economists-including the author of this book-failed to realize the 
fact that it places in the hands of governments the power to manipu- 
late their nations' currency easily. Economists blithely assumed that 
no government of a civilized nation would use the gold exchange 
standard intentionally as an instrument of inflationary policy. Of 
course, one must not exaggerate the role that the gold exchange 
standard played in the inflationary ventures of the last decades. The 


Currency and Credit Manipulation 

main factor was the proinflationary ideology. The gold exchange 
standard was merely a convenient vehicle for the realization of the 
inflationary plans. Its absence did not hinder the adoption of infla- 
tionary measures. The United States was in 1933 by and large still 
undcr the classicaI gold standard. This fact did not stop the New 
Deal's inflationism. The United States at one stroke-by confiscating 
its citizens' gold holdings-abolished the classical gold standard and 
devalued the dollar against gold. 

The new variety of the gold exchange standard as it developed in 
the years between the first and the second World Wars may be 
called the flexible gold exchange standard or, for the sake of sim- 
plicity, the flexible standard. Under this system the Central Bank or 
the Foreign Exchange Equalization Account (or whatever the name 
of the equivalent governmental institution may be) freely exchanges 
the money-substitutes which are the country's national legal tender 
either against gold or against foreign exchange, and vice versa. The 
ratio at which these exchange deals are transacted is not invariably 
fixed, but subject to changes. The parity is flexible, as people say. 
This flexibility, however, is practically always a downward flexi- 
bility. The authorities used thcir power to lower the equivalence of 
the national currency in terms of gold and of those foreign currencies 
whose equivalcnce against gold did not drop; they never ventured to 
raise it. If the parity against another nation's currency was raised, the 
change was only the consummation of a drop that had occurred in 
that other currency's equivalence (in terms of gold or of other na- 
tions' currencies which had remained unchanged). Its aim was to 
bring the appraisal of this definite foreign currency into agreement 
with the appraisal of gold and the currencies of other foreign nations. 

If the downward jump of the parity is very conspicuous, it is called 
a devaluation. If the alteration of the parity is not so great, editors of 
financial reports describe it as a weakening in the international ap- 
praisaI of the currency ~oncerned.~ 

In both cases it is usual to refer 
to the event by deciaring that fhc country concerned has raised the 
price of gold. 

The characterization of the flexible standard from the catallactic 
point of view must not be confused with its description from the 
legal point of view. The cataIlactic aspccts of the issue are not affected 
by the constitutional problems involved. It is immaterial whether the 
power to alter the parity is vested in the Iegislative or in the adminis- 
trative branch of the government. It is immateriaI whether the au- 
thorization given to the administration is unlimited or, as was the case

in the United States under New Deal legislation, limited by a terminal 
point beyond which the officers are not free to devalue further. What 
counts alone for the economic treatment of the matter is that the 
principle of flexible parities has been substituted for the principle of 
the rigid parity. Whatever the constitutional state of affairs may be, 
no government could embark upon "raising the price of gold" if 
public opinion were opposed to such a manipulation. If, on the other 
hand, public opinion favors such a step, no legal technicalities could 
check it altogethcr or even delay it for a short time. What happened 
in Great Britain in 1931, in the United States in 1933, and in France 
and Switzerland in 1936 clearly shows that the apparatus of repre- 
scntative government is able to work with the utmost speed if public 
opinion endorses the so-called experts' opinion concerning the ex- 

pediency and necessity of a currency's dcvaluation. 

One of the main objectives of currency devaluation-whether 
large-scale or small-scale-is, as will be shown in the next section, to 
rearrange foreign trade conditions. These effects upon foreign trade 
rnake it impossible for a small nation to take its own course in cur- 
rency manipulation irrespective of what those countries are doing 
with whom its trade relations are closest. Such nations are forced to 
follow in the wake of a foreign country's monetary policies. As far as 
monetary policy is concerned they voluntarily become satellites of 
a foreign power. By keeping their own country's currency rigidly 
at par against the currency of a monetary "suzerain-country," they 
follow all the alrerations which the "suzerain" brings about in i;s 
own currency's parity against gold and the other nation's currencies. 
They join a monetary bloc and integrate their country into a mone- 
tary area. The most talked about bloc or area is the sterling bloc or 
area. 

Thc flexible standard must not be confused with conditions in those 

countries in which the government has merely proclaimed an official 

parity of its domestic currency against gold and foreign exchange 

without making this parity effective. The characteristic feature of 

the flexible standard is that any amount of domestic money-substi- 

tutes can in fact be freely exchanged at the parity chosen against 

gold or foreign exchange, and vice versa. At this parity the Central 

Bank (or whatever the name of the government agency entrusted 

with the task may be) freely buys and sells any amount of domestic 

currency and of foreign currency of at least one of those countries 

which themselves are either under the gold standard or under the 

flexible standard. The domestic banknotes are really redeemable. 

In the absence of this essentiaI feature of the flexible standard, de-


Currency and Credit Manipulation 

Crees proclaiming a definite parity have a quite different meaning and 
bring about quite different effect^.^ 

4. The Objectives of Currency Devaluation 
The flexible standard is an instrument for the engineering of in- 
flation. The only reason for its acceptance was to make reiterated in- 
flationary moves technically as simpIe as possible for the authorities. 

In the boom period that ended in 1929labor unions had succeeded 
in almost all countries in enforcing wage rates higher than those 
which the market, if rnanipulatcd only by migration barriers, would 
have determined. These wage rates already produced in many coun- 
tries institutional unemployment of a considerable amount while 
credit expansion was still going on at an accelerated pace. When finally 
the inescapable depression came and commodity prices began to drop, 
the labor unions, firmly supported by the governments, even by those 
disparaged as anti-labor, clung stubbornly to their high-wages policy. 
They either flatly denied permission for any cut in nominal wage rates 
or conceded only insufficient cuts. The result was a tremendous in- 
crease in institutional unemployment. (On the other hand, those 
workers who retained their jobs improved their standard of living 
as their hourly real wages went up.) The burden of unemployment 
doles became unbearable. The millions of unemployed were a serious 
menace to domestic peace. The industrial countries were haunted by 
the specter of revolution. But union leaders were intractable, and no 
statesman had the courage to challenge them openly. 

In this plight the frightened rulers bethought themselves of a 
makeshift long since recommended by inflationist doctrinaires. As 
unions objected to an adjustment of wages to the state of the money 
relation and commodity prices, they chose to adjust the money rela-
tion and commodity prices to the height of wage rates. As they saw 
it, it was not wage rates that were too high; their own nation's mone- 
tary unit was overvalued in terms of gold and foreign exchange and 
had to be readjusted. Devaluation was the panacea. 

The objectives of devaluation were: 

I. To presen7e the height of nominal wage rates or even to create 
the conditions required for their further increase, while real wage 
rates should rather sink. 
2. To make commodity prices, especially the prices of farm prod- 
ucts, rise in terms of domestic money or, at least, to check their fur- 
ther drop. 
3. See below, section 6 of this chapter. 

784 Human Action 

3. To favor the debtors at the expense of the creditors. 
4. To encourage exports and to reduce imports. 
5. To attract more foreign tourists and to make it more expensive 
(in tcrms of domestic money) for the country's own citizens to visit 
foreign countries. 
However, neither the governn~ents nor the literary champions of 
their policy were frank enough to admit openly that one of the main 
purposes of devaluation was a reduction in the height of real wage 
rates. They preferred for the most part to describe the objective of 
devaluation as the removal of an alleged "fundamental disequilibrium" 
between the domestic and the international "levcl" of prices. They 
spoke of the necessity of lowcring domestic costs of production. But 
they were anxious nor to mention that one of the two cost items they 
expected to lower by devaluation was real wage rates, the other being 
interest stipulated on long-term business debts and the principal of 
such debts. 

It is impossible to take seriously the arguments advanced in favor 
of devaluation. Thcy were utterfy confused and contradictory. For 
devaluation was not a policy that originated from a cool weighing of 
the pros and cons. It was a capitulation of governments to union 
leaders who did not want to lose face by admitting that their wage 
policy had failed and had produced institutional unemployment on 
an unprecedented scale. It was a desperate makeshift of weak and 
inept statesmen who were motivated by their wish to prolong their 
tenure of office. In justifying their policy, these demagogues did not 
bothcr about contradictions. They promised the processing industries 
and the farmers that devaluation would make prices rise. But at the 
same time they promised the consumers that rigid price control 
would prevent any increasc in the cost of living. 

After all, the governments could still excuse their conduct bv re- 
ferring to the fact that under the given state of public opinion, en- 
tirely under the sway of the doctrinal fallacies of labor unionism, no 
other policy couid be resorted to. No such excuse can be advanced 
for those authors who hailed the flexibility of foreign exchange rates 
as the perfect and most desirable monetary system. While govern- 
ments were still anxious to emphasize that devnluation was an emer- 
gency measure not to be repeated again, these authors proclaimed the 
flexible standard as the most appropriate monetary system and werc 
eager to demonstrate the alleged evils inherent in stability of foreign 
exchange rates. In their blind zeal to please the governments and the 
powerfuI pressure groups of unionized labor and farming, they over- 


Currency and Credit itlanipulation 

stated tremendously the case of flexible parities. But the drawbacks of 
standard flexibility became manifest very soon. The enthusiasm for 
devaluation vanished quickly. In the years of the second World War, 
hardly more than a decade after theeday when Great Britain had set 
the pattern for the flexible standard, even Lord Keynes and his adepts 
discovered that stability of foreign exchange rates has its merits. One 
of the avowed objectives of the International Monetary Fund is to 
stabilize foreign exchange rates. 

If one looks at devaluation not with the eyes of an apologist of gov- 
ernment and union policies, but with the eyes of an economist, one 
must first of all stress the point that all its alleged bIessings arc tern- 
porary only. Moreover, they depend on the condition that only 
one country devalues while the other countries abstain from de- 
vaIuing their own currencies. If the other countries devalue in the 
same proportion, no changes in foreign tradc appear. If they devalue 
to a greater extent, all these transitory blessings, whatever they may 
be, favor them exclusively. A general acceptance of the principles of 
the flexible standard must therefore result in a mutual overbidding be- 
tween the nations. At the end of this race is the complete destruction 
of all nations' monetary systems. 

'The much talked about advantages which devaluation secures in 
foreign trade and tourism, are entirely due, to the fact that the ad- 
justment of domestic prices and wage rates to the state of affairs 
created by devaluation requires some time. As long as this adjustment 
process is not yet completed, exporting is encouraged and importing 
is discouraged. However, this nierely means that in this interval the 
citizens of the devaluating country arc getting less for what they are 
selling abroad and paying more for what they are buying abroad; con- 
comitantly they must restrict their consumption. This effect may 
appear as a boon in the opinion of those for whom the balance of 
tradc is the yardstick of a nation's welfare. In plain language it is to 
be described in this way: The British citizen must export more 
Eritish goods in order to buy that quantity of tea which he received 
before the devaluation for a smaller quantity of exported British 
goods. 

Thc devaluation, say its champions, reduces the burden of debts. 
This is certainly true. It favors debtors at the expense of creditors. 
In the eyes of those who still have not learned that under modern 
conditions the creditors must not be identified with the rich nor 
the debtors with the poor, this is beneficial. The actual effect is that 
thc indebted owners of real estate and farm land and the shareholders 


Human Action 

of indebted corporations are helped to the disadvantage of the enor- 
mous majority whose savings are invested in bonds, debentures, 
savings-bank deposits, and insurance policies. 

There are also foreign loans to be considered. When Great Britain, 
the United States, France, Switzerland, and some other European 
crediror countries devalued their currencies, they made a gift to 
their foreign debtors. 

One of the main arguments advanced in favor of the flexible stand- 
ard is that it lowers the rate of interest on the domestic money market. 
Under the classical gold standard and the rigid gold exchange stand- 
ard, it is said, a country must adjust the domestic rate of interest to 
conditions on the international money market. Under the flexible 
standard it is free to follow in the determination of interest rates a 
policy exclusively guided by considerations of its own domestic wel- 
fare. 

The argument is obviously untenable with regard to those coun- 
tries in which the total amount of debts to foreign countries exceeds 
the total amount of loans granted to foreign countries. When in the 
course of the nineteenth century some of these debtor nations adopted 
a sound money policy, their firms and citizens couId contract foreign 
debts in terms of their national currency. This opportunity disap- 
peared altogether with. the change in these countries' monetary 
policies. No American banker would contract a loan in Italian lire or 
try to float an issue of lire bonds. As far as foreign credits are con- 
cerned, no change in a debtor country's domestic currency conditions 
can be of any avail. As far as domestic credits are concerned, devalua- 
tion abates only the already previously contracted debts. It enhances 
the gross market rate of interest of new debts as it makes a positive 
price premium appear. 

This is valid also with regard to interest rate conditions in the 
creditor nations. There is no need to add anything to the demonstra- 
tion that interest is not a monetary phenomenon and cannot in the 
long run be affected by monetary measures. 

It is true that the devaluations which were resorted to by various 
governments between 1931and 1938 made reaI wage rates drop in 
some countries and thus reduced the amount of institutional unem- 
ployment. The historian in dealing with these devaluations may 
therefore say that they were a success as they prevented a revolution- 
ary upheaval of the daily increasing masses of unemployed and as, 
under the prevailing ideological conditions, no other means could be 
resorted to in this critical situation. But the historian will no less have to 
add that the remedy did not affect the root causes of institutional 


Currency and Credit Manipulation 

unemployment, the faulty tenets of labor unionism. Devaluation was 
a cunning device to elude the sway of the union doctrine. It worked 
because it did not impair the prestige of unionism. But precisely be- 
cause it left the popularity of unionism untouched, it could work 
only for a short time. Union leaders learned to distinguish between 
nominal wage rates and real wage rates. Today their policy aims 
at raising real wage rates. They can no longer be cheated by a drop 
in the monetary unit's purchasing power. Devaluation has worn out 
its usefulness as a device for reducing institutional uncmployment. 

Cognizance of these facts provides a key for a correct appraisal of 
the role which Lord Keynes's doctrines played in the years betwccn 
the first and second World Wars. Keynes did not add any new idea 
to the body of inflationist fallacies, a thousand times refuted by 
economists. His teachings were even more contradictory and in- 
consistent than those of his predecessors who, like Silvio Gesell, were 
dismissed as monetary cranks. He merely knew how to cloak the plea 
for inflation and credit expansion in the sophisticated terminology 
of mathematical economics. The interventionist writers were at a loss 
to advance plausible arguments in favor of the policy of reckless 
spending; they simply could not find a case against the economic 
theorem concerning institutional unemployment. In this juncture 
they greeted the "Keynesian Revolution'' with the verses of Words- 
worth: "Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was 
very heaven." 'It was, howevcr, a short-run heaven only. We may 
admit that for the British and American governments in the 'thirties 
no way was left other than that of currency devaluation, inflation and 
credit expansion, unbalanced budgets, and deficit spending. Govern- 
ments cannot free themselves from the pressure of public opinion. 
They cannot rebel against the preponderance of generally accepted 
ideologies, howevcr fallacious. But this does not excuse the office- 
holders who could resign rather than carry out policies disastrous 
for the country. Still less does it excuse authors who tried to provide

5. Credit Expansion 
It has been pointed out that it would be an error to look upon credit 
expansion exclusively as a mode of government interference with the 
market. The fiduciary media did not come into existence as instru-

ments of govcrnment policies deliberately aiming at high prices and 
high nominal wage rates, at lowering the market rate of intercst and 
at debt abatement. They evolved out of the regular business of bank- 
ing. When the bankers, whose receipts for call money deposited were 
dealt with by the pubIic as money-substitutes, began to lend a part 
of the funds deposited with them, they had nothing else in view than 
their own business. They considered it harmless not to keep the whole 
equivalent of the receipts issued as a cash reserve in their vaults. They 
were confident that they would always be in a position to comply 
with their obligations and, without delay, redeem the notes issued 
even if they mere to lcnd a part of the d~posits. Banknotes became 
fiduciary media within the operation of the unhampered market 
cconorny. The begetter of credit expansion was the banker, not the 
authority. 

But today credit expansion is an exclusive prerogative of govern- 
ment. As far as private banks and bankers are instrumental in issuing 
fidnciary media, their role is mcrely ancillary and concerns only 
technicalities. The governments alone direct the course of affairs. 
They have attained full supremacy in all matters concerning the 
size of circulation credit. While the size of the credit expansion that 
private banks and bankers are able to engineer on an unhampered 
market is strictly limited, the governments aim at the greatest pos- 
sible amount of credit expansion. Credit expansion is the government's 
foremost tool in their struggle against the market economy. In their 
hands it is the magic wand designed to conjure awav the scarcity of 
capital goods, to lower the rate of interest or to abolish it altogether, 
to finance lavish government spending, to expropriate the capitalists, 
to contrive everIasting booms. and to make-evervbody prosperous. 

The inescapable consequences of credit expansion are shown by the 
theory of the trade cycle. Even those economists who still refuse to 
acknowledge the correctness of the monetary or circulation credit 
theory of the cyclical fluctuations of business have never dared to 
cneaio:: heconcl~sivenessand Irrcfutabiliw of what this theory 

1 
asserts with regard to the necessary effects of credit expansion. These 
economists too must admit and do admit that the upswing is invariably 
conditioned by credit expansion, that it could not come into being 
and continue -without credit expansion, and that it turns into de- 
pression when the further progress of credit expansion stops. Their 
explanation of the trade cycle in fact boils down to the assertion 
that what first generates the upswing is not credit expansion, but 
other factors. The credit expansion which even in their opinion is 
an indispensable requisite of the general boom, is, they say, not the 


Currency and Credit Adanipulation 

outcome of a policy deliberately aiming at low interest rates and at 
encouraging additiona1 investment for which the capital goods needed 
are lacking. It is something which, without active interference on the 
part of the authorities, in a miraculous way always appears whenever 
these other factors begin their operation. 

It is obvious that these economists contradict themselves in opposing 
plans to eliminate the fluctuations of business by abstention from 
credit expansion. The na'ive supporters of the inflationist view of 
history are consistent when they infer from their--of course, utterly 
fallacious and contradictory-tenets that credit expansion is the eco- 
nomic panacea. But those who do not deny that credit expansion is 
an indispensable condition of the boom, disagree with their own 
doctrinc in fighting the proposals to curb credit expansion. Both the 
spokesn~en of the governments and the powerful pressure groups and 
the champions of the dogmatic "unorthodoxy" that dominates the 
university departments of economics agree that one should try to 
avert the recurrcnce of depressions and that the realization of this end 
requires the prevention of booms. They cannot advance tenable argu- 
ments against the proposals to abstain from policies encouraging credit 
expansion. But they stubbornly refuse to listen to any such idea. They 
passionately disparage the plans to prevent credit expansion as devices 
which would perpetuate depressions. This attitude clearly demon- 
stratcs the correctness of the statcmcnt that the trade cycle is the 
product of policies intentionally aimed at lowering the rate of interest 
and engendering artificial booms. 

It is a fact that today measures aimed at lowering the rate of in- 
terest are gcnerally considered highly desirable and that credit ex- 
pansion is viewed as the efficacious means for the attainment of this 
end. It is this prcpossession that impels all governments to fight the 
gold standard. Expamionism is the great slogan of our day. All political 
parties and all pressure groups are firmly committed to an easy money 
p01icy.~ 

The nhi~rtirr~Of exp2nsiGfi is m fa~.rCr the interests ef seFse

groups of the population at the expense of others. This is, of course, 

5. If a bank does not expand circulation credit by issuing additional fiduciary 
media (either in the form of banknotes or in the form of deposit currency), it 
cannot generate a boom even if it lowers the amount of interest charged below 
the rate of the unhampered market. It merely makes a gift to the debtors. The 
inference to be drawn from the monetary cycle theory by those who want to 
prevent the recurrence of booms and of the subsequent depressions is not that 
the banks should not lower the rate of interest, but that they should abstain from 
credit expansion. Professor Haberler (Prosperity and Depression, pp. 65-66) has 
completely failed to grasp this primary point, and thus his critical remarks are 
vain. 

Human Action 

the best that interventionism can attain when it does not hurt the in- 
terests of all groups. But while malting the whole community poorer, 
it may still enrich some strata. Which groups belong to the latter class 
depends on the special data of each case. 

The idea which generated what is called qualitative credit control 
is to channel the additiona1 credit in such a way as to concentrate the 
alleged blessings of credit expansion upon certain groups and to 
withhold them from other groups. The credits should not go to the 
stock exchange, it is argued, and should not make stock prices soar. 
They should rather benefit the "legitimate productive activity" of 
the processing industries, of mining, of LLlegitimate commerce," and, 
first of all, of farming. Other advocates of qualitative credit control 
want to prevent the additional credits from being used for investment 
in fixed capital and thus immobilized. They are to be used, instead, 
for the production of liquid goods. According to these plans thc 
authorities give the banks concrete directions concerning the types 
of loans they should grant or are forbidden to grant. 

However, all such schemes are vain. Discrimination in lending is 
no substitute for checks placed on credit expansion, the only means 
that could really prevent a rise in stock exchange quotations and an 
expansion of investment in fixed capital. Thc mode in which the 
additional amount of credit finds its way into the loan market is 
only of secondary importance. What matters is that there is an inflow 
of newly created credit. If the banks grant more credits to the farm- 
ers, the farmers are in a position to repay loans received from other 
sources and to pay cash for their purchases. If they grant more 
credits to business as circulating capital, they free funds which were 
previously tied up for this use. In any case they create an abundance 
of disposable money for which its owners try to find the most profit- 
able investment. Very promptly these funds find outlets in the stock 
exchange or in fixed investment. The notion that it is possible to pursue 
a credit expansion without making stock prices rise and fixcd invest- 
meat ex auu 13 au3uld.'

I?---' :--"----

The typical course of events under credit expansion was until a 
few years ago determined by two facts: that it was credit expansion 
under the gold standard, and that it was not the outcome of concerted 
action on the part of the various national governments and the central 
banks whose conduct these governments directed. The first of these 
facts meant that governments were not prepared to abandon the 
convertibility of their country's banknotes according to the rigidly 
fixed parity. The second fact resulted in a lack of quantitative uni- 

6.Cf.Machlup, The Stock Market, Credit and Capital Formation, pp. 256261. 

Czirrelzcy and Credit Manipulation 

formity in the size of credit expansion. Some countries got ahead of 
other countries and their banks were faced with the danger of a 
serious external drain upon their reserves in goId and foreign cx-
change. In order to preserve their own solvency, these banks were 
forced to take recourse to drastic credit restriction. Thus they 
created the panic and inaugurated the depression on the domestic 
market. The panic very soon spread to other countries. Businessnlen 
in these other countries became frightened and increased their bor- 
rowing in order to strengthen their liquid funds for all possible evenrs. 
Tt was precisely this increased demand for new credits which im- 
pelled the monetary authorities of their own countries, alrcady 
alarmed by the crisis in the first country, also to resort to contraction. 
'Shus within a few days or weeks the depression became an inter- 
national phenomenon. 

The policy of devaluation has to some cxtcnt altered this typical 
sequence of events. Menaced by an external drain, the monetary 
authorities do not resort to credit restriction and to raising the rate 
of intcrest charged by the central banking system. They devalue. 
Yet devaluation does not solve the problem. If the government does 
not care how far foreign exchange rates may rise, it can for some time 
continue to cling to credit expansion. But one day the crack-up boom 
will annihilate its monetary system. On the other hand, if the authority 
wants to avoid the necessity of devaluing again and again at an ac- 
celerated pace, it must arrange its domestic credit policy in such 
a way as not to outrun in credit expansion the other countries against 
which it wants to keep its domestic currency at par. 

Many economists take it for granted that the attempts of the 
authorities to expand credit will always bring about the same almost 
regular alternation between periods of booming trade and of sub- 
sequent depression. They assume that the effects of credit expansion 
will in the future not differ from those that have been observed since 
the end of the eighteenth century in Great Britain and since the 
middle of the nineteenth century in \Vestern and Central Europe 
and in North America. But wc may wonder whether conditions have 
not changed. The teachings of the monetary theory of the trade cycle 
are today so well known even outside of the circle of economists, that 
the nai've optimism which inspired the entrepreneurs in the boom 
periods of the past has given way to a certain skepticism. It may be 
that businessmen will in the future react to credit expansion in a man- 
ner other than they have in the past. It may be that they will avoid 
using for an expansion of their operations the easy money available 
because they v17iIl keep in mind the inevitable end of the boom. Some 


Human Action 

signs forebode such a change. But it is too early to make a positive 
statement. 

The Chimera of Contracyclical Policies 

An essential element of the "unorthodox" doctrines, advanced both by 
all socialists and by all interventionists, is that the recurrence of depressions 
is a phenomenon inherent in the very operation of the market economy. 
But while the socialists contend that only the substitution of socialism for 
capitalism can eradicate the evil, the interventionists ascribe to the govern- 
ment the power to correct the operation of the market economy in such a 
way as to bring about what they call "econon~ic stability." These inter- 
ventionists would be right if their antidepression plans were to aim at a 
radical abandonment of credit expansion policies. However, they reject 
this idea in advance. What they want is to expand credit more and more 
and to prevent depressions by the adoption of special "contracyclical" 
measures. 

In the context of these plans the government appears as a deity that 
stands and works outside the orbit of human affairs, that is independent 
of the actions of its subjects, and has the power to interfere with these 
actions from without. It has at its disposal means and funds that are not 
provided by the people and can be freely used for whatever purposes the 
rulers are prepared to employ them for. What is needed to make the 
most beneficent use of this power is mereIy to foIlow the advice given by 
the experts. 

The most advertised among these suggested remedies is contracyclical 
timing of public works and expenditure on public enterprises. The idea is 
not so new as its champions would have us believe. When depression came, 
in the past, public opinion always asked the government to embark upon 
public works in order to create jobs and to stop the drop in prices. But the 
problem is how to finance these public works. If the government taxes the 
citizens or borrows from them, it does not add anything to what the 
Keynesians call the aggregate amount of spending. It restricts the private 
citizen's power to consume or to invest to the same extent that it increases 
its own. If, however, the government resorts to the cherished inflationary 
methods of financing, it makes things worse, not better. It may thus delay 
for a short time the outbreak of the slump. But when the unavoidable 
payoff does come, the crisis is the heavier the longer the government has 
postponed it. 

The interventionist experts are at a loss to grasp the real problems in- 
volved. As they see it, the main thing is "to plan public capital expenditure 
well in advance and to accumulate a shelf of fully worked out capital 
projects which can be put into operation at short notice." This, they say,

vide the materia1 means for their execution. The interventionists believe 

that this could be easily achieved by holding back government expendi- 

ture in the boom and increasing it when the depression comes. 

Now, restriction of government expenditure may certainly be a good 
thing. But it does not provide the funds a government needs for a later 
expansion of its expenditure. An individual may conduct his affairs in this 
way. He may accumulate savings when his income is high and spend them 
later when his income drops. But it is different with a nation or all nations 
together. The treasury may hoard a considerable part of the lavish rev- 
enue from taxes which flows into the public exchequer as a result of 
the boom. As far and as long as it withholds these funds from circulation, 
its policy is really deflationary and contracyclical and may to this extent 
weaken the boon] created by credit expansion. But when these funds are 
spent again, they alter the money relation and crcate a cash-induced tend- 
ency toward a drop in the monetary unit's purchasing power. By no means 
can these funds provide the capital goods required for the execution of 
the shelved public works. 

The fundamental error of the interventionists consists in the fact that 
they ignore the shortage of capital goods. In their eyes the depression is 
merely caused by a mysterious lack of the people's propensity both to 
consume and to invest. While the only real problem is to produce more 
and to consume less in order to increase the stock of capital goods avail- 
able, the interventionists want to increase both consumption and invest- 
ment. They want the government to embark upon projects which are 
unprofitable precisely because the factors of production needed for their 
execution must be withdrawn from other lines of employment in which 
they would fulfill wants the satisfaction of which the consumers consider 
more urgent. They do not realize that such public works must consider- 
ably intensify the real evil, the shortage of capital goods. 

One could, of course, think of another node for the employment of the 
savings the government makes in the boom period. The treasury could 
invest its surplus in buying large stocks of all those materials which it will 
later, when the depression comes, need for the execution of the public 
works planned and of the consumers' goods which those occupied in these 
public works will ask for. But if the authorities were to act in this way, 
they would considerably intensify the boom, accelerate the outbreak of 
the crisis, and make its consequences more serious." 

-411 this talk about contracyclical government activities ai~ns at one goal 
only, namely, to divert the public's attention from cognizance of the real 

8. In dealing with the contracyclical policies the interventionists always refer 
to the alleged success of these policies in Sweden. It is true chat public capital 
expenditure in Sweden was actually doubled between 1932 and 1939.But this was 
not the cause, but an effect, of Sweden's prosperity in the 'thirties. This prosperity 
was entirely due to the rearmament of Germany. This Nazi policy increased the 
German demand for Swedish products on the one hand and restricted, on the 
other hand, German competition on the worId market for those products which 
Sweden could supply. Thus Swedish exports increased from 1932 to 1938 (in 
thousands of tons): iron ore from 2,219 to 12,485; pig iron from 31,047 to 92,980;

cause of the cyclical fluctuations of business. All governments are firmly 
committed to the policy of low interest rates, credit expansion, and in- 
flation. When the unavoidable aftermath of these short-term policies 
appears, they know only of one remedy-to go on in inflationary ven- 
tures. 

6. Foreign Exchange Control and Bilateral 
Exchange Agreements 
If a government fixes the parity of its domestic credit or fiat money 
against gold or foreign exchange at a higher point than the market- 
that is, if it fixes maximum prices for gold and foreign exchangc be- 
low the potential market price-the effects appear which Gresham's 
Law describes. A state of affairs results which-very inadequately-
is called a scarcity of foreign exchange. 

It is the characteristic mark of an economic good that the supply 
available is not so plentiful as to make any intended utilization of it 
possible. An object that is not in short supply is not an economic good; 
no prices are asked for it or paid for it. As money must necessarily 
be an economic good, the notion of a money that would not be scarce 
is absurd. What those governments who complain about a scarcity 
of foreign exchange have in mind is, however, something different. 
It is the unavoidablc outcome of thcir policy of price fixing. It means 
that at the price arbitrarily fixed by the government demand exceeds 
supply. If the government, having by means of inflation reduced the 
purchasing power of the domestic monetary unit against gold, foreign 
exchange, and commodities and services, abstains from any attempt 
at controlling foreign exchange rates, there cannot be any question of 
a scarcity in thc sense in which the government uses this term. He who 
is ready to pay the market price would be in a position to buy as much 
foreign exchange as he wants. 

But the government is resolved not to tolerate any rise in foreign 
exchangc rates (in terms of the inflated domestic currency). ReIy- 
ing upon its magistrates and constables, it prohibits any dealings in 
foreign exchange on terms different from the ordained maximum 
price. 

As the government and its satellitcs see it, the rise in foreign ex- 
change rates was caused by an unfavorable balance of payments and by 
ferro-alloys from 15,453 to 28,605; other kinds of iron and steel from 134,237 to 
256,146; machinery from 46,230 to 70,605. The number of unemployed applying 
for relief was r 14,000in 1932 and 165,000 in 1933.It dropped,as soon as German 
rearmament came into full swing, to 115,oooin 1934, to 62,000in 1935, and was 
16,000 in r938. The author of this "miracle" was not Keynes, but Hitler. 


Currerzcy and Credit Manipulation 

the purchases of speculators. In order to remove the evil, the govern- 
ment resorts to measures restricting the demand for foreign exchange. 
Only those people should henceforth have the right to buy foreign 
exchange who need it for transactions of which the government ap- 
proves. Commodities the importation of which is superfluous in the 
opinion of the government should no longer be imported. Pavment 
of interest and principal on debts due to foreigners is Citi-
zens must no longer travel abroad. The government does not realize 
that such measures can never "improve" the halance of payments. 
If imports drop, exports drop concomitantly. The citizens who are 
prevented from buying foreign goods, from paying back foreign 
debts, and from traveling abroad, will not keep the amount of 
domestic money thus left to them in their cash holdings. They will 
increase their buying either of consumers' or of producers' goods and 
thus bring about a further tendency for domestic prices to rise. But 
the more prices rise, the more will exports be checked. 

Now the government goes a step further. It nationalizes foreign 
exchange transactions. Every citizen who acquires-through ex-
porting, for example-an amount of foreign exchange, is bound to 
sell it at the official rate to the office of foreign exchange control. If 
this provision, which is tantamount to an export duty, were to be 
effectively enforced, export trade would shrink greatly or cease al- 
together. The government certainly does not like this result. But 
neither does it want to admit that its interference has utterly failed to 
achieve the ends sought and has produced a state of affairs which is, 
from the government's own point of view, much worse even than the 
previous state of affairs. So the government resorts to a makeshift. 
It subsidizes the export trade to such an extent that the losses which 
its policy inflicts upon the exporters are compensated. 

On the other hand, the government bureau of foreign exchange 
control, stubbornly clinging to the fiction that foreign exchange rates 
have not "real1y"'risen and that the official rate is an effective rate, 
sells foreign exchange to importers at this official rate. If this policy 
w-cre to be really followed, it would be equivalent to paying bonuses 
to the merchants concerned. They would reap windfall profits in 
selling the imported commodity on the domestic market. Thus the 
authority resorts to further makeshifts. It either raises import duties 
or levies special taxes on thc importers or burdens their purchases of 
foreign exchange in some other way. 

Then, of course, foreign exchange control works. But it works only 
because it virtually acknowledges the market rate of foreign exchange. 
The exporter gets for his proceeds in foreign exchange the official

rate plus the subsidy, which together equal the market rate. The 
importer pays for foreign exchange the official rate plus a special 
premium, tax, or duty, which together equal the market rate. The 
only people who are too dull to grasp what is really going on and let 
themselves be fooled by the bureaucratic terminology, are the authors 
of books and articles on new methods of monetary management and 
on new monetary experience. 

The n~ono~olization 

of buying and selling of foreign exchange by 
the government vests the control of foreign trade in the authorities. 
It does not affect the determination of foreign exchange rates. It does 
not matter whether or not the government makes it illegal for the 
press to publish the real and effective rates of foreign exchange. As 
far as foreign trade is still carried on, only these real and effective rates 
are in force. 

In order to conceaI better the true state of affairs, governments are 
intent upon eliminating all reference to the real foreign exchange rate. 
Foreign trade, they think, should no longer be transacted by the 
intermediary of money. It should be barter. They enter into barter 
and clearing. agreements with foreign governments. Each of the two 
contracting countries should sell to the other country a quantity of 
goods and services and receive in exchange a quantity of other goods 
and services. In the text of these treaties any reference to the real mar- 
ket rates of foreign exchange is carefully avoided. However, both 
parties caIculate their sales and their purchases in terms of the world 
market prices expressed in gold. These clearing and barter agreements 
substitute bilateral trade between two countries for the triangular or 
multilateral trade of the liberal age. But they in no way affect the fact 
that a country's national currency has lost a part of its purchasing 
power against gold, foreign exchange, and commodities. 

As a policy of foreign trade nationalization, foreign exchange 
control is a step on the way toward a substitution of socialism for the 
market economy. From any other point of view it is abortive. It can 
certainly neither in the short run nor in the long run affect the deter- 
mination of the rate of foreign exchange. 

Remarks About the Nazi Barter Agreements 

The barter and clearing agreements which the Nazi Government of the 
Rcich conchded with various foreign countries have been misinterpreted 
by the vast literature on the subject. As these misinterpretations are the 
basis of many current errors concerning monetary problems, it seems 
expedient to devote a few remarks to them. 


Cwrency and Cwdit Manipulation 

The considerations which motivated foreign governments to enter into 
such agreements with the Reich were not uniform. Neither were the 
political and economic consequences of these agreements homogeneous. 
We may deal with the problems involved by discussing first the case of 
the agreement with Switzerland and then those with the countries of the 
European southeast. 

The Swiss banks had, before Hitler seized power, lent comparatively 
enormous sums to German business. Moreover, one of Switzerland's main 
industries, tourism, depended to a great extent on German patrons. The 
German foreign exchange control laws gave the German authorities the 
power to prohibit all payments to Swiss banks and to prevent Germans 
from visiting the country. The clearing agreement was the only means for 
the Swiss to salvage at least a part of their German assets and to induce 
the Reich to permit a limited number of Germans to spend a holiday in 
the Swiss hotels. 

The case of the Balkan agreements is even more interesting as their 
meaning was srill more distorted by misinterpretation. 

Let us look at an example. The Reich and one of the southeastern coun- 
tries of Europe-we may call it Balkania--concluded an agreement con- 
cerning the mutual exchange of commodities, which could be bought or 
sold on the world market for 20 million dollars. Balkania had to give a 
world-market value of 10 million dollars in food and raw materials, Ger- 
many had to give a world-market value of 10 million dollars in manu- 
factured goods. The pcculiar feature of the bargain was that these com- 
modities bought and sold were in the terms of the contract not valued 
according to their world-market price, but at a higher rate, let us say 10 
per cent above the prices of the world market. For the goods Germany had 
to buy, Balkania was charged I I million instead of 10,but on the other hand 
Balkania was credited for the goods it sold with I I million instead of 10. 
This overvaluation was totally, or at least to a great extent, concealed in 
the rate of exchange between the Reichsmark and the balkan, the mone- 
tary unit of Balkania's currency system, which the barter agreement fixed 
at a level different from the actual rate of exchange. 

Let us assume that the dollar was actually worth 10balkans on the world 
market. By virtue of the barter agreement, Balkania sold to Germany food 
and raw materials for which English businessmen offercd roo million 
balkans, for I 10million, and bought manufactured goods which she could 
buy from English or American exporters for IOO million balkans, for I 10 
million. 

Tn order to understand the meaning of this strange proccdure, we have 
to realize that the loss and the gain from these overvaluations compensated 
each other onIy for the whole nations, but not for the individual citizens. 
For socialist Germany, where under Hitler all business was nationalized, 
this made no difference at all. But in Balkania domestic production and 
domestic trade were still based on privatc ownership; only the foreign 
trade of Balkania was controlled by the government. There it was of great 


Human Action 

consequence that those burdened by the ovcrvaluation of the imported 
goods and those favored by the overvaluation of the exported goods were 
not the same people. The terms of the barter agreement resulted, there- 
fore, in a shift of income from some goups of citizens (of course, the 
black sheep of the government) to other groups of citizens (of course, the 
government's pet children). The government of Balkania distributed the 
boon of the transaction in this way: 

r. 
Higher prices paid to the producers of the exported food 
and raw materials 5 million 
2. 
Gains (legal and illegal) of the government agency entrus- 
ted with the execution of the barter agreement and of the 
"friends" of the government managing it I million 
3. 
Gains retained by the treasury 4 million 
The losses of the transaction, on the other hand, were distributed in this 
way: 

r. 
Higher prices of imported commodities paid by those who 
were favored by the higher prices of the exported goods I million 
z. 
Higher prices of imported goods paid by other citizens 5 million 
3. 
Higher prices of imported goods paid by the government 
(e.g., for arms, railroad equipment, etc.) 4 million 
It is obvious that the friends of the government and the peasants producing 
food and raw materials realized gains of 5 million, whereas the nonagri- 
cultural sections of the population were burdened with 5 million additional 
expenditure. Such an effect was in line with Balkania's whole econonlic 
policy; like many other contemporary governments, the rulers of Balkania 
made every effort to favor the agricultural section of the population at the 
expense of the nonagricultural section. 

The political consequences of these agreements were twofold: Bal-
kania's government became dependent on the Reich, but its power at home 
increased. The government now disposed of a fund which could be used 
for the benefit of its friends, who were on the payroll of the company or 
government agency entrusted with the execution of the barter agreement.

groups of the peasantry who did not support the government or who were 
members of a linguistic or religious minority. The products which had to 
be exported to Germany were purchased only from the sympathetic 
producers. The nonsympathisers were barred from the enjoyment of the 
benefits of the treaty; they had to sell their entire crop at the lower prices 
corresponding to the world market prices. In Yugoslavia, for instance, the 
Catholic Croat peasants complained that the government purchased only 
from Serbs. It is impossible to discover whether this complaint was really 
well founded; in any case, the Croats did not blame the Nazis, they blamed 
the Yugoslavian government.

The barter agreements gave Germany a kind of monopoly of the trade 
with the countries of southeastern Europe which could not fail to link 
these countries politically with the Rcich. From the Nazi point of view, 
this practice meant a skillful use of the domestic economic antagonisms 
within these countries for the achievement of their own political ends. 
To the governments of the Balkan states, these barter agreements offered 
an opportunity of initiating a policy favoring the farming class at the 
expense of the nonagricultural classes. What the industrial countries of 
Western and Central Europe achieved by tariffs and other measures dis- 
criminating against the products of foreign agriculcurc and what the 
United States achieved by some of the agricultural measures of the New 
Deal, was in Rumania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia achieved by the 
barter treaties with Germany. 

Faced with the problem of this German economic offensive in the Bal- 
kans, Great Britain was helpless. It had to withdraw from markets where it 
could buy only at prices higher than those in other countries. Conse- 
quently, the governments of the Balkan countries concerned declared that 
there were no pounds available for the payment of imports from Great 
Britain and refused to grant import licenses. Cotnmerce between Great 
Britain and these countries was severely restricted. 

The same was no less true with regard to all other countries of Western 
Europe and of America. 

Such was the true nature of these much talked about clearing agree- 
ments which were hailed by many authors as the dawn of a new age of 
monetary management. 


XXXII. CONFISCATION AND REDISTRIBUTION 
I. The Philosophy of Confiscation 
I 
I
NTERVENTIOXISM is guided by the idea that interfering with prop- 
erty rights does not affect the size of production. The most na'ive 
manifestation of this faIlacy is presented by confiscatory intervention- 
ism. The yield of production activities is considered a given magni- 
tude independent of the merely accidental arrangements of society's 
social order. The task of the government is seen as the "fair" distri- 
bution of this national income among the various members of soci- 
ety. 

The interventionists and the socialists contend that all commodities 
are turned out by a social process of production. When this process 
comes to an end and its fruits ripen, a second social process, that of 
distribution of the yield, follows and alIots a share to each. The char- 
acteristic feature of the capitalist order is that the shares allotted are 
unequal. Some people-the entrepreneurs, the capitalists, and the 
landowners-appropriate to themselves more than they should. Ac- 
cordingly, the portions of other people are curtailed. Government 
should by rights expropriate the surplus of the privileged and distribute 
it among the underprivileged. 

Now in the market economy this alleged dualism of two independ- 
ent processes, that of production and that of distribution, does not 
exist. There is only one process going on. Goods are not first pro- 
duced and then distributed. There is no such thing as an appropriation 
of portions out of a stock of ownerless goods. The products come

one must first confiscate them. It is certainly very easy for the govern- 
nlentaI apparatus of compulsion and coercio~ to embark upon con- 
fiscation and expropriation. But this does not prove that a durable 
system of economic affairs can be built upon such confiscation and 
expropriation. 

When the Vikings turned their backs upon a community of 
autarkic peasants whom they had plundered, the surviving victims 
began to work, to till the soil, and to build again. When the pirates 
returned after some years, they again found things to seize. But 


Co~z/iscntian and Redistribution 80I 

capitalism cannot stand such reiterated predatory raids. Its capital ac- 
cumulation and investnlents are founded upon the expectation that no 
such expropriation u.ill occur. If this expectation is absent, people \\.ill 
prefer to consume their capital instead of safeguarding it for the 
expropriators. This is the inherent error of all plans that aim at cotn- 
lining private oumrship and rciterntcd e~propriation. 

'I'he social reforniers of older da).s ainlecl at the establishnient of

there is no room for division of labor and specializ~tion in processing 
trades. It is a serious mistake to call such a social order agrarian social-
imz. It is rnerely a juxtaposition of econoniicallv self-sufficient housc- 
holds. 

In the lr~arltet econoiny the soil is a Ineatis of production Iilw any 
other material factor of production. Plans aiming at a more or less 
ccpl distribution of the soilamong the farnling population arc, under 
the conditions of the market economy, merely plans for granting 
privileges to a group of less efficient producers at the expense of the 
immense majority of consumers. The operation of the market tends 
to diminate all tlke farmers whose cost of production is higher than 
the marginal costs needed for the production of that amount of farm 
products the consumers are ready to buy. It determines the size of 
the farms as well as the methods of production applied. If the govern- 
ment interferes in order to make a different arrangement of the condi- 
tions of farming prevail, it raises the average price of farm products. 
If under competitive conditions m farmers, each of them operating 
a 1,000-acrc farm, produce all those farm products the consumers are 
ready to acquire, and the government interferes in order to substitute 5 
~nfarmers, each of them operating a zoo-acre farm, for 7n, the pre- 
vious number of farmers, the consumers foot the bill. 

It is vain to justify such land reforms by referring to natural law 
and othcr metaphysical ideas. The simple truth is that they enhance 
the price of agricultural products and that they also impair nonagri- 
cultural production. As more manpower is needed to turn out a unit 
of farm produce, more people are employed in farming and less are 
left for the processing industries. The total amount of commodities 
available for consumption drops and a certain group of people is 
favored at the expense of the majority. 


Human Action 

3. Confiscatory Taxation 
Today the main instrument of confiscatory interventionism is 
taxation. It does not matter whether the objective of estate and in- 
come taxation is the allegedly social motive of equalizing wealth and 
income or whether the primary motive is that of revenue. What alone 
counts is the resulting effect. 

The average man looks at the problems involved with unveiled 
envy. Why should anybody be richer than he himself is? The lofty 
moralist cbncea~s his resentment in philosophical disquisitions. He 
argues that a man who owns ten millions cannot be made happier by 
an increment of ninety millions more. Inversely, a man who owns a 
hundred millions does not feel any impairment of happiness if his 
wealth is reduced to a hare ten millions only. The same reasoning holds 
good for excessive incomes. 

To judge in this way means to judge from an individualistic point 
of view. The yardstick applied is the supposed sentiments of individ- 
uals. Yet the problems involved are social problems; they must be ap- 
praised with regard to their social consequences. What matters is 
neither the happiness of any Croesus nor his personal merits or de- 
merits; it is society and the productivity of human effort. 

A law that prohibits any individuai from accumulating more than 
ten millions or from making more than one million a year restricts 
the activities of prccisely those entrepreneurs who arc most success- 
ful in filling the wants of consumers. If such a law had been enacted 
in thc United States fifty years ago, many who are multimillionaires 
today would live in more modest circukstances. But all those new 
branches of industry which supply the masses with articles unheard 
of before would operate, if at all, -on a much smaller scale, and their 
products would be beyond the reach of the common man. It is mani- 
festly contrary to the interest of the consumers to prevent the most 
efficient entrepreneurs from expanding the sphere of their activities 
1-p the ..;hi& rjIe m~hlirgnnrnvec ~f their ~ondijctof

business by buying their products. Here again the issue is who should 
be supreme, the consumers or the government? In the unhampered 
market the behavior of consumers, their buying or abstention from 
buying, ultimately determines each individual's income and wealth. 
Should one vest in the government the power to overrule the con- 
sumers' choices? 

The incorrigible statolatrist objects. In his opinion what motivates 
the activities of the great entrepreneur is not the lust for wealth, but 
the lust for power. Such a "royal merchant" would not restrict his 


Confiscation and Redistribution 

activities if he had to deliver all the surplus earned to the tax collector. 
His lust for power cannot he weakened by any considcrations of 
mere money making. Let us, for the sake of argument, accept this 
psychology. But on what else is the power of a businessman founded 
than on his wealth? How would Rockefeller and Ford have been in a 
position to acquire "power" if they had been prevented from acquir- 
ing wealth? After all, those statolatrists are on comparatively better 
grounds who want to prohibit the accumulation of wealth precisely 
because it gives a man economic p0wer.l 

Taxes are necessary. But the system of discriminatory taxation uni- 
versally accepted unher the misleading name of progressive taxation 
of income and inheritance is not a mode of taxation. It is rather a mode 
of disguised expropriation of the successful capitalists and entre-
preneurs. Whatever the govcrnments' satellites may advance in its 
favor, it is incompatible with the preservation of the marltet economy. 
It can at best be considered a means of bringing about socialism. 
Looking backward on the evolution of income tax rates from the 
beginning of the Federal income tax in 19s3 until the present day, 
one can hardly believe that the tax will not soon absorb loo per cent 
of a11 surplus above the customary level of a labor-union leader's 
salary. 

Economics is not concerned with the spurious metaphysical doc- 
trines advanced in favor of tax progression, but with its repercussions 
on the operation of the market economy. The interventionist authors 
and politicians look at the problems involved from the angle of their 
arbitrary notions of what is "socially desirable." As they see it, "the 
purpose of taxation is never to raise moncy," since the govcrnmcnt 
"can raise all the money it needs by printing it." The true purpose 
of taxation is "to leave less in the hands of the taxpayer." ? 

Economists approach the issue from a differcnt angle. They ask 
first: what are the effects of confiscatory taxation on capital accumu- 
lation? The greater part of that portion of the higher incomcs which 
is taxed away would have been used for the accumulation of addi- 
tional capital. If the treasury employs the proceeds for current ex- 
penditure, the result is a drop in the amount of capital accumulation. 
The same is valid, even to a greater extent, for death taxes. They force 
the heirs to sell a considcrable part of the testator's estatc. This capital 
is, of course, not destroyed; it merely changes ownership. But the 

I. There is no need to emphasize again that the use of the terminology of 
political rule is entirely inadequate in the treatment of economic problems. See 
above, pp. 272-273.

ics (New York, I%), pp. 307-308. 

Human Action 

savings of the purchasers, which are spent for the acquisition of the 
capital sold by the heirs, would have constituted a net increment in 
capital available. Thus the accumulation of new capital is slowed 
down. The realization of technological improvement is impaired; the 
quota of capital invested per worker employed is reduced; a check is 
placed upon the rise in the productivity of labor and upon the con- 
comitant rise in real wage rates. It is obvious that the popular belief 
that this mode of confiscatory taxation harms only the immediate 
victims, the rich, is false. 

If capitalists are faced with the likelihood that the income tax or 
the estate tax will rise to roo per cent, they will prefer to consume 
their capital funds rather than to preserve them for the tax collector. 

Confiscatory taxation results in checking economic progress and 
improvement not only by its effect upon capital accumulation. It 
brings about a general trend toward stagnation and the preservation 
of business practices which could not last under thc competitive con- 
ditions of the unhampered market economy. 

It is an inherent feature of capitalism that it is no respecter of 
vested interests and forces every capitalist and entrepreneur to adjust 
his conduct of business anew each day to the changing structure of 
the market. Capitalists and entrepreneurs are never free to relax. As 
long as they remain in business they are never granted the privilege of 
quietly enjoying the fruits of their ancestors' and their own achieve- 
ments and of lapsing into a routine. If they forget that their task is 
to serve the consumers to the best of their abilities, they will very 
soon forfeit their eminent position and wiIl be thrown back into the 
ranks of the common man. Their leadership and their funds are con- 
tinually chaIlenged by newcomers. 

Every ingenious man is free to start new business projects. He may 
be poor, his funds may be modest and most of them may be borrowed. 
But if he fills the wants of consumers in the best and cheapest way, 
he will succeed by means of "excessive" profits. He pIoughs back 
the greater part of his profits into his business, thus making it grow 
rapidly. It is the activity of such enterprising parvenus that provides 
the market economy with its "dynamism." These nouveaux riches 
are the harbingers of economic improvement. Their threatening com- 
petition forces the old firms and big corporations either to adjust their 
conduct to the best possible service of the public or to go out of 
business. 

But today taxes often absorb the greater part of the newcomer's 

L'ex~e~si~e"

profits. He cannot accumulate capital; he cannot expand 
his own business; he will never become big business and a match for 


Confiscation and Redistribution 

the vested interests. The old firms do not need to fear his competition; 
they are sheltered by the tax collcctor. They may with impunity in- 
dulge in routine, thcy may defy the wishcs of the public and become 
conscrvative. It is true, thc income tax prevents them, too, from ac- 
cumulating new capital. But what is rnorc important for them is that 
it prevents the dangerous newcomer from accumulating any capital 
They are virtually privileged by thc tax system. In this sense progrcs- 
sive taxation checks economic progress and makcs for rigidity. While 
under unhampered capitalism the ownership of capital is a liability 
forcing the owner to serve the consumers, modern net hods of taxation 
transform it into a privilcgc. 

The interventionists complain that big business is getting rigid and 
bureaucratic and that it is no longer possible for competent new-
comers to challenge the vested interests of the old rich families. 
Howevcr, as far as thcir coimplaints are justified, they complain about 
things which arc merely the result of their own policics. 

Profits are the driving force of the market economy. The greater 
the profits, the better the necds of the consumers are supplied. For 
profits can only be reaped by removing discrepancies bctwecn the 
demands of thc consumers and the previous state of production 
activities. He who scrves the public best, makes thc highest profits. 
In fighting profits governments deliberatcly sabotage thc operation of 
the markct economy. 

Confiscatory Taxation and Risk-Taking 

A popular fallacy considers entrepreneurial profit a reward for risk- 
taking. It looks upon the entrepreneur as a gambler who invests in a lot- 
tery after having weighed the favorable chances of winning a prize against 
the unfavorable chances of losing his stake. This opinion manifests itself 
most clearly in the description of stock-exchange transactions as a sort of 
gambling. From the point of view of this widespread fable, the evil caused 
by confiscatory taxation is that it disarranges the ratio bctwecn the favor- 
able and the unfavorable chances in the lottery. The prizes are cut down, 
while the unfavorable hazards remain unchanged. Thus capitalists and 
entrepreneurs are discouraged from embarking upon risky ventures. 

Every word in this reasoning is false. The owner of capital does not 
choose between more risky, less risky, and safe investments. He is forced, 
by the very operation of the market economy, to invest his funds in such 
a way as to supply the most urgent needs of the consumers to the best 
possible extent. If the methods of taxation resorted to by the government 
bring about capital consumption or restrict the accumulation of new 
capital, the capital required for marginal employments is lacking and an 
expansion of investment which would have been effected in the absence 


Humn Action 

of these taxes is prevented. The wants of the consumers are satisfied to a 
lesser extent onIy. But this outcome is not caused by a reluctance of capi- 
talists to take risks; it is caused by a drop in capital supply. 

There is no such thing as a safe investment. If capitalists were to behave 
in the way the risk fable describes and were to strive after what they con- 
sider to be the safest investment, their conduct would render this line of 
investment unsafe and they would certainly lose their input. For the 
capitalist there is no means of evading the law of the market that makes it 
imperative for the investor to comply with the wishes of the consumers 
and to produce all that can be produced under the given state of capital 
supply, technological knowledge, and the valuations of the consumers. A 
capitalist never choses that investment in which, according to his under- 
standing of the future, the danger of losing his input is smallest. He chooses 
that investment in which he expects to make the highest possible profit. 

Those capitalists who are aware of their own lack of ability to judge 
correctly for themselves the trend of the market do not invest in equity 
capital, but lend their funds to the owners of such venture capital. They 
thus enter into a sort of partncrship with those on whose better ability to 
appraise thc conditions of the market they rely. It is customary to call 
venture capital risk capital. However, as has been pointed out, the success 
or failure of the investment in preferred stock, bonds, debentures, mort- 
gages, and other loans depends ultimately also on the same factors that 
determine success or failure of the venture capital invested.3 There is no 
such thing as independence of the vicissitudes of the market. 

If taxation were to strengthen the supply of loan capital at the expense 
of the supply of vcnture capital, it would make the gross market rate of 
interest drop and at the same time, by increasing the share of borrowed 
capital as against the share of equity capital in the capital structure of the 
firms and corporations, render the investment in loans more uncertain. 
The process would therefore be self-liquidating. 

The fact that a capitalist as a rule does not concentrate his investments, 
both in common stock and in loans, in one enterprise or one branch of 
business, but prefers to spread out his funds among various classes of in- 
vestment, does not suggest that he wants to reduce his "gambling risk." 
He wants EOimprnve his chances of earning profits. 

Nobody embarks upon any investment if he does not expect to make a 
good investment. hTobody deliberately chooses a malinvestment. It is only 
the emergence of conditions not properly anticipated by the investor that 
turns an investment into a malinvestment. 

As has been pointed out, there cannot be such a thing as noninvested 
~apital.~

The capitalist is not free to choose between investment and non- 
investment. Neither is he free to deviate in the choice of his investments 
from the lines determined by the most urgent among the yet unsatisfied 

3. Cf.above, pp. 536537. 
4. Cf.above, pp. 518-520. 

Confiscationand Redistribution. 


wants of the consumers. He must try to anticipate these future wants cor- 
rectly. Taxes may reduce the amount of additional capital available or 
even bring about consumption of capital previously accumulated. But 
they do not affect the employment of capital available, whatever its 
quantity may be. 

With an excessive height of the income and estate tax rates for the very 
rich, a capitalist may consider it the most advisable thing to keep all his 
funds in cash or in bank balances not bearing any interest. He consumes 
part of his capital: pays no income tax and reduces the inheritance tax 
which his heirs will have to pay. But even if people really behave this 
way, their conduct does not affcct the employment of the capital available. 
It affects prices. But no capital good remains uninvested on account of it. 
And the operation of the market pushes investment into those lines in 
which it is expected to satisfy the most urgent not yet satisfied demand of 
the buying public. 


XXXIII. SYNDICALISM AND CORPOKAI'IVLSM 
I. The Syndicalist Idea 
HE term syndicalism is used to signify two entirely different Tthings. 

Syndicalism, as used by the partisans of Georges Sorel, means special 
revolutionary tactics to be resorted to for the realization of socialism. 
Labor unions, it implies, should nor waste their strength in the task 
of improving the conditions of wage earners within the frame of 
capitalism. They should adopt action dirccte, unflinching violence 
to destroy all the institutions of capitalism. They should never cease 
to fight-in the genuine sense of the term-for their ultimate goal, 
socialism. The proletarians must not let themselves be fooled by the 
catchwords of the bourgeoisie, such as liberty, democracy, representa- 
tive government. They must seek their salvation in the class struggle, 
in bloody revolutionary upheavals and in the pitiless annihilation of 
the bourgeois. 

This doctrine played and still plays an enormous role in modern 
politics. It has provided essential ideas to Russian Bolshevism, Italian 
Fascism, and German Nazism. But it is a purely political issue and 
may be disregarded in a catallactic analysis. 

The second meaning of the term syndicalism refers to a program 
of society's economic organization. While socialism aims at the sub- 
stitution of government ownership of the means of production for 
private ownership, syndicalism wants to give the ownership of the 
plants to the workers employed in them. Such slogans as "The raiI- 
roads to the railroadmen" or "The mines to the miners" best indicate 
the ultimate goals of syndicalism. 

The ideas of socialism and those of syndicalism in the sense of action 

directe were developed by intellcctuals whom consistent adepts of all 

Marxian sects cannot help describing as bourgeois. But the idea of 

syndicalism as a system of social organization is a genuine product of 

the "proletarian mind." It is precisely what the naive employee con- 

siders a fair and expedient means for improving his own material well 

being. Eliminate the idle parasites, the entrepreneurs and capitalists, 


Syndicalism and Corporativism 

809 

and give their "unearned incomes" to the workers! Nothing could be 
simpler. 

If one were to take these plans seriously, one would not have to 
deal with them in a discussion of the problems of interventionism. 
One would have to realize that syndicalism is neither socialism, nor 
capitalism, nor interventionism, but a system of its own different from 
these three schemes. However, one cannot take the syndicalist pro- 
gram seriously, and nobody ever has. hTobody has been so confused 
and injudicious as to advocate syndicalism openly as a social system. 
Syndicalism has played a role in the discussion of economic issues only 
as far as certain programs unwittingly contained syndicaIist features. 
There are elements of syndicalism in certain objectives of govern- 
ment and labor-union interference with market phenomena. There 
are, moreover, guild socialism and corporativism, which pretcnded 
to avoid the governmcnt omnipotence inherent in all socialist and 
interventionist ventures by adulterating them with a syndicalist ad- 
mixture. 

2. The Fallacies of Syndicalism 
The root of the syndicalist idea is to be seen in the belief that entre- 
preneurs and capitalists are irresponsible autocrats who are free to 
conduct their affairs arbitrarily. S~zch a dictatorship must not be 
tolerated. The liberal movement, which has substituted representative 
government for the despotism of hereditary kings and aristocrats, 
must crown its achievements by substituting "industrial democracy" 
for the tyranny of heredimry capitalists and entrepreneurs. The eco- 
nomic revohtion must bring to a climax the liberation of the people 
which the political revolution has inaugurated. 

The fundamental error of this argument is obvious. The entre- 

preneurs and capitalists are not irresponsible autocrats. They are 

unconditionally subjcct to the sovereignty of the consumers. The 

market is a consumers' democracy. The syndicalists want to transform 

it into a producers' democracy. This idea is fallacious, for the sole end 

and purpose of production is consumption. 

What the syndicalist considers the most serious defect of the capital- 

ist system and disparages as the brutality and callousness of autocratic 

profit-seekers is precisely the outcome of the supremacy of the con- 

sumers. Under the competitive conditions of the unhampered marker 

economy the entrepreneurs are forced to improve technological 

methods of production without regard to the vested interests of the 

workers. The employer is forced never to pay workers more than 

corresponds to the consumers' appraisal of their achievements. If an 


Human Action 

employee asks for a raise because his wife has borne him a new baby 
and the employer refuses on the ground that the infant does not 
contribute to the factory's effort, the employer acts as the mandatary 
of the consumers. These consumers are not prepared to pay more for 
any commodity merely because the worker has a large family. The 
naivete of the syndicalists manifests itself in the fact that they would 
never concede to those producing the articles which they themselves 
are using the same privileges which they claim for themselves. 

The syndicalist principle requires that the shares of every corpo- 
ration should be taken away from "absentee ownership" and be 
equally distributed among the employees; payment of interest and 
principal of debts, is to be discontinued. "Management" will then 
be placed in the hands of a board elected by the workers who are 
now also the shareholders. This mode of confiscation and redistribu- 
tion will not bring about equality within the nation or the world. It 
would give more to the employees of those enterprises in which the 
quota of capital invested per worker is greater and less to those in 
which it is smaller. 

Jt is a characteristic fact that the syndicalists in dealing with these 
issues always refer to management and never mention cntrepre- 
neurial activities. As the average subordinate employee sees things, 
all that is to be done in the conduct of business is to accomplish those 
ancillary tasks which are entrusted to the managerial hierarchy within 
the frame of the entrepreneurial plans. In his eyes the individual plant 
or workshop as it exists and operates today is a permanent establish- 
ment. It will never change. It w-ill always turn out the same products. 
He ignores completely the fact that conditions are in a ceaseless flux, 
and that the industrial structure must be daily adjusted to the solu- 
tion of new problems. His world view is stationary. It does not allow 
for new branches of business, new products, and new and better 
methods for manufacturing the old products. Thus the syndicalist 
ignores the essential problems of entrepreneurship: providing the 
capital for new industries and the expansion of already existing in- 
dustries, restricting branches for the products demand for which 
drops, technological improvement. It is not unfair to call syndicalism 
the economic philosophy of short-sighted people, of those adamant 
conservatives who look askance upon any innovation and are so 
hlindcd by envy that they call down curses upon those who provide 
them with more, better, and cheaper products. They are like patients 
who grudge the doctor his success in curing them of a malady. 


Syndicalisnz and Corporativism 

3. Syndicalist Elements in Popular Policies 
The popularity of syndicalism manifests itself in various postulates 
of contemporary economic policies. The essence of these policies is 
always to grant privileges to a minority group at the expense of the 
inlmense majority. They invariably result in impairing the wealth 
and income of the majority. 

Many labor unions are intent upon restricting the number of work- 
ers employed in their field. While the public wants more and cheaper 
books, periodicals and newspapers, and would get them under the 
conditions of an unhampered labor market, the typographical unions 
prevent many newcomers from working in printing offices. The 
effect is, of course, an increase in the wages earned by the union 
members. But the corollary is a drop of wage rates for those not 
admitted and an enhancement in the price of printed matter. The 
same effect is brought about by union opposition to the utilization 
of technological improvements and by all sorts of featherbedding 
practices. 

Radical syndicalism aims at entirely eliminating payment of divi- 
dends to shareholders and of interest to creditors. The interventionists 
in their enthusiasm for middle-of-the-road solutions want to appease 
the syndicalists by giving the employees a part of the profits. Profit- 
sharing is a very popular slogan. There is no need to enter anew into 
an examination of the fallacies implied in the underlying philosophy. 
It suffices to show the absurd consequences to which such a system 
must lead. 

It may sometimes be good policy for a small shop or for an enter- 
prise employing highly skiIled workers, to grant an extra bonus to 
employees if business is prosperous. But it is a non sequitur to assume 
that what under special conditions may be wise for an individual 
firm could work satisfactorily as a general system. There is no rea- 
son why one welder should make more money because his employer 
earns high profits and another welder less because his employer earns 
lower profits or no profits at all. The workers themselves would rebel 
against such a method of remuneration. It could not be preserved even 
for a short time. 

A caricature of the profit-sharing scheme is the ability-to-pay prin- 
ciple as recently introduced into the program of American labor 
unionism. While the profit-sharing scheme aims at an allocation to 
the employees of a part of profits already earned, the ability-to-pay 
scheme aims at a distribution of profits which some external observers 
believe the employer may earn in the future. The issue has been 


Human Actio~t 

obfuscated by the fact that the Truman Administration, after having 
acccpted the new union doctrine, announced that it was appointing 
a "fact-finding" board which would have the authority to examine 
the books of the employers in order to determine their ability to 
pay an increase in wages. However, the books can provide information 
only about past costs and proceeds and past profits and losses. Esti- 
mates of future volume of production, future sales, future costs, or 
future profits or losses are not facts, but speculative anticipations. 
There are no facts about future pr0fits.l 

There cannot be any question of realizing the syndicalist ideal 
according to which the proceeds of an enterprise should completely 
go to the employees and nothing should be left for interest on the 
capital invested and profits. If one wants to abolish what is called 
"unearned income," one must adopt socialism. 

4. Guild Socialism and Corporativism 
The ideas of guild socialism and corporativism originated from two 
different lines of thought. 

The eulogists of medieval institutions long praised the eminence 
of the guilds. What was needed to wash away the alleged evils of the 
market economy was simply to return to the wcll-tried methods of 
the past. However, all these diatribes remained sterile. The critics 
never attempted to particularize their suggestions or to elaborate def- 
inite plans for an economic reconstruction of the social order. The 
most they did was to point out the alleged superiority of the old 
quasi-representative assemblies of the type of the French Etats-
GE'ne'rauxand the German Standische Landtage as against the modern 
parliamentary bodies. Rut even with regard to this constitutional 
issue their ideas were rather vague. 

The second source of guild socialism is to be found in specific 
political conditions of Grcat Britain. When the conflict with Germany 
became aggravated and finally in 1914 led to war, the younger British 
sociaIists began to fee1 uneasy about their program. The state idolatry 
of the Fabians and their glorification of German and Prussian institu- 
tions was paradoxical indeed at a time when their own country was 
involved in a pitiless struggle against Germany. What was the use of 
fighting the Germans when the most "progressive" intellectuals of 
the country longed for the adoption of German social policies? Was 
it possible to praise British liberty as against Prussian bondage and 

I. Cf. F. R. Fairchild, Profits and the Ability to Pay Wages (Irvington-on-
Hudson, 1946)~p. 47. 

Syndicalism and Corporativism 813 

at the same time to recommend the methods of Bismarck and his 
successors? British socialists yearned for a specifically British brand 
of socialism as different as possible from the Teutonic brand. The 
problem was to construct a socialist scheme without totalitarian state 
supremacy and omnipotence, an individualistic variety of collec-
tivism. 

The solution of this problenl is no less impossible than that of the 
construction of a triangular square. Yet the young men of Oxford 
confidently tried to solve it. They borrowed for their program thc 
name guild socialisnz from the littlc known group of the eulogists of 
the Middle Ages. They characterized their scheme as industrial self- 
government, an economic corollary of the most renowned principle 
of English political rule, local government. In their plans they assigned 
the leading role to the most powerful British pressure group, the 
trade unions. Thus they did everything to make their device palatable 
to their countrymen. 

However, neither these captivating adornments nor the obtrusive 
and noisy propaganda could mislead intelligent people. The plan was 
contradictory and blatantly impracticable. After only a few years it 
feIl into complete oblivion in the country of its origin. 

But thcn came a resurrection. The ItaIian Fascists badly needed an 
economic program of their own. After having seceded from the in- 
ternational partics of Marxian socialism, they could no longer pose as 
socialists. Neither were they, the proud scions of the invincible Roman 
legionaries, prepared to make concessions to Western capitalism or to 
Prussian interventionism, the counterfeit ideologies of the barbarians 
who had destroyed their glorious empire. They were in search of 
a social philosophy, purely and exciusively Italian. Whether or not 
they knew that their gospeI was merely a replica of British guild 
socialism is immaterial. At any rate, the stato corporatiz~o was nothing 
but a rebaptized edition of guild socialism. The differences concerned 
only unimportant details. 

Corporativism was flamboyantly advertised by the bombastic propa- 
ganda of the Fascists, and the success of their campaign was over- 
whelming. Many foreign authors exuberantly praised the miraculous 
achievements of the new system. The governments of Austria and 
Portugal emphasized that they were firmly committed to the noble 
ideas of corporativism. The Pope's encyclical Quadragesirno anno 
(193I ) contained passages which could-but need not-be inter-
preted as an endorsement of corporativism. At any rate Catholic 
authors sapported this interpretation in books which were published 
with the imprimatur of the Church authorities, 


8x4 Human Action 

Yet neither the Italian Fascists nor the Austrian and Portuguese 
governments ever made any serious attempt to realize the corpora- 
tivist utopia. The Italians attached to various institutions the label 
corporativirt and transformed the university chairs of political econ- 
omy into chairs of economia politica e corporativa. But never was 
there any question of the much talked about essential feature of cor- 
porativism, self-government of the various branches of trade and 
industry. The Fascist Government clung first to the same principles 
of economic policies which all not outright socialist governments 
have adopted in our day, interventionism. Then Iater it turned step 
by step toward the German system of socialism, i.e., all-round state 
control of economic activities. 

The fundamental idea both of guild socialism and of corporativism 
is that every branch of business forms a monopolistic body, the guild 
or co~porazione.~

This entity enjoys full autonomy; it is free to settle 
all its internal affairs without interference of external factors and of 
people who are not themselves members of the guild. The mutual 
relations between the various guilds are settled by direct bargaining 
from guild to guild or by the decisions of a general assembly of the 
delegates of all guilds. In the regular course of affairs the govern- 
ment does not interfere at all. Only in exceptional cases, when an 
agreement between the various guilds cannot be attained, is the state 
called in.3 

In drafting this scheme the guild socialists had in mind the condi- 
tions of British local government and the relation between the various 
local authorities and the central government of the United Kingdom. 
They aimed at self-government of each branch of industry; they 
wanted, as the Webbs put it, "the right of self-determination for each 
vocation." In the same way in which each municipality takes care 
of its local community affairs and the national government handles 
only those affairs which concern the interests of the whole nation, 
the guild alone should have jurisdiction over its internaI affairs and the 
government should restrict its interference to those things which the 
guilds themselves cannot settle. 

However, within a system of social cooperation under the division 

z. The most elaborate description of guild socialism is provided by Sidney and 
Beatrice Webb, A Constitution for the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain 
(London, 1920); the best book on corporativism is Ugo Papi, Lezioni di 
Economia Generale e Corporativa, Vol. I11 (Padova, 1934). 
3. Mussolini declared on January 13, 1934,in the Senate: "Solo in un second0 
tempo, quando le categorie non abbiano trovato la via dell' accord0 e dell' equili- 
brio, lo Stato potrh intervenire." (Quoted by Papi, op. cit.,p. 225.)

Syndicalism and Corporativism 

of labor there are no such things as matters of concern only to those 
engaged in a special plant, enterprise, or branch of industry and of no 
concern to outsiders. There are no internal affairs of any guild or 
corporazione the arrangement of which does not affect the whole 
nation. A branch of business does not serve only those who are oc- 
cupied in it; it serves everybody. If within any branch of business there 
is inefficiency, a squandering of scarce factors of production, or a 
reluctance to adopt the most appropriate methods of production, 
everybody's material interests are hurt. One cannot leave decisions 
concerning the choice of technological methods, the quantity and 
quality of products, the hours of work, and a thousand other things 
to the members of the guild, because they concern outsiders no less 
than members. In the market economy the entrepreneur in making 
such decisions is unconditionally subject to the law of the market. 
He is responsible to the consumers. If he were to defy the orders of 
the consumers, he would suffer losses and would very soon forfeit 
his entrepreneurial position. But the monopolistic guild does not need 
to fear competition. It enjoys the inalienable right of exclusively 
covering its field of production. It is, if left alone and autonomous, 
not the servant of the consumers, but their master. It is free to resort 
to practices which favor its members at the expense of the rest of 
the people. 

It is of no importance whether within the guild the workers alone 
rule or whether and to what extent the capitalists and the former 
entrepreneurs cooperate in the management of affairs. It is likewise 
without importance whether or not some seats in the guild's govern- 
ing board are assigned to representatives of the consumers. What 
counts is that the guild, if autonomous, is not subject to pressure that 
would force it to adjust its operations to the best possible satisfaction 
of the consumers. It is free to give the interests of its members pre- 
cedence over the interests of consumers. There is in the scheme of 
guild socialism and corporativism nothing that would take into ac- 
count the fact that the only purpose of production is consumption. 
Things are turned upside down. Production becomes an end in itself. 

When the American New Deal embarked upon the National Re- 
covery Administration scheme, the government and its brain trust 
were fully aware of the fact that what they planned was merely the 
establishment of an administrative apparatus for full government 
control of business. The short-sightedness of the guild socialists and 
corporativists is to be seen in the fact that they believed that the 
autonomous guild or corporazione could be considered a device for 
a working system of social cooperation. 


Human Action 

It is very easy indeed for each guild to arrange its allegedly internal 
affairs in such a way as to satisfy its members fully. Short hours of 
work, high wage rates, no further improvements in tcchnoIogica1 
methods or in the quality of the products which could inconvenience 
the members-very well. But what will the result be if all guilds re- 
sort to the same policies? 

Under the guild system there is no longer any question of a market. 
There are no longer any prices in the catalIactic setise of the term. 
There are neither competitive prices nor monopoly prices. Those 
guilds which monopolize the suppIy of vital necessities attain a 
dictatorial position. The producers of indispensable foodstuffs and 
fuel and the suppliers of electric current and of transportation can 
with impunity squeeze the whole people. Does anybody expect that 
the majority will tolerate such a state of affairs? There is no doubt 
that any attempt to realize the corporarivist utopia would in a very 
short time lead to violent conflicts, if the government did not inter- 
fere when the vital industries abused their privilcged position. What 
the doctrinaires envisage only as an exceptional measure-the inter-
ference of the government-will become the rule. Guild socialism and 
corporativism will turn into full government control of all produc- 
tion activities. They will develop into that system of Prussian 
Zwangswirtschaft which they were designed to avoid. 

There is no need to deal with the other fundamental shortcomings 

of the guild scheme. It is as deficient as any other syndicalist project. 

It does not take into account the necessity of shifting capital and labor 

from one branch to another and of establishing new branches of pro- 

duction. It entirely neglects the problem of saving and capital ac- 

cumulation. In short, it is nonsense. 


XXXIV. THE ECONOMICS OF WAR 
I. Total War 
T 
T
HE market economy involves peaceful cooperation. It bursts 
asunder when the citizens turn into warriors and, instead of 
exchanging commodities and services, fight one another. 

The wars fought by primitive tribes did not affect cooperation 
under the division of labor. Such cooperation by and large did not 
exist between the warring parties before the outbreak of hostilities. 
These wars were unlimited or total wars. They aimed at total victory 
and total defeat. The defeated were either exterminated or expelled 
from their dwelling places or enslaved. The idea that a treaty could 
settle the conflict and make it possible for both parties to live in peace- 
ful neighborly conditioqs was not present in the minds of the fighters. 

'1-he spirit of conquest does not acknowledge restraints other than 
those imposed by a power which resists successfully. The principle 
of empire building is to expand the sphere of supremacy as far as 
possible. The great Asiatic conquerors and the Roman Imperators 
were stopped onIy when they could not march farther. Then they 
postponed aggression for later days. They did not abandon their 
ambitious plans and did not consider independent foreign states as 
anything else than targets for later onslaughts. 

'This philosophy of boundless conquest also animated the rulers of 
medieval Europe. They too aimed first of all at the utn~ost expansion 
of the size of their reajms. But the institutions of feudalism provided 
than with only scanty means for warfare. lTassals were not obliged 
to fight for their lord more than a limited time. The selfishness of the 
vassals who insisted on their rights checked the king's aggressiveness. 
Thus the peaceful coexistence of a number of sovereign states orig- 
inated. In the sixteenth century a Frenchman, Bodin, developed the 
theory of national sovereignty. In the seventeenth century a Dutch- 
man, Grotius, added to it a theory of international relatibns in war 
and peace. 

With the disintegration of feudalism, sovereigns could no longer 
rely upon summoned vassals. They "nationalized" the country's armed 
forces. Henceforth, the warriors were the Icing's mercenaries. The 


8I 8 Human Action 

organization, equipment, and support of such troops were rather 
costly and a heavy burden on the ruler's revenues. Thc ambitions of 
the princes were unbounded, but financial considerations forced 
them to moderate their designs. They no longer planned to conquer a 
whole country. All they aimed at was the conquest of a fcw cities 
or of a province. To attain more would also have been unwise 
politically. For the European powers were anxious not to let any 
one of them become too powerful and a menace to their own safety. 
A too impetuous conqueror must always fear a coalition of all those 
whom his bigness has frightened. 

The combined effect of military, financial, and political circum- 
stances produced the limited warfare which prevailed in Europe in 
the three hundred years preceding the French Revolution. Wars were 
fought by comparatively small armies of professional soldiers. War 
was not in affair of the peoples; it concerned the rulers only. The 
citizens detested war which brought mischief to them and burdened 
them with taxes and contributions. But they considered themselves 
victims of events in which they did not participate actively. Even 
the belligerent armies respected the "neutrality" of the civilians. As 
they saw it, they were fighting the supreme warlord of the hostile 
forces, but not the noncombatant subjects of the enemy. In the wars 
fought on the European continent the property of civilians was con- 
sidered inviolable. In 1856 the Congress of Paris made an attempt 
to extend this principle to naval warfare. More and more, eminent 
minds began to discuss the possibility of abolishing war altogether. 

Looking at conditions as they had developed under the system of 
limited warfare, philosophers found wars useless. Men arc killed or 
maimed, wealth is destroyed, countries are devastated for the sole 
benefit of Icings and ruling oligarchies. The peoples themselves do 
not derive any gain from victory. The individual citizens are not 
enriched if their rulers expand the size of their realm by annexing a 
province. For the people wars do not pay. The only cause of armed 
conflict is the greed of autocrats. The substitution of representative 
government for royal despotism will abolish war altogether. Democ- 
racies are peaceful. It is no concern of theirs whether their nation's 
sovereignty stretches over a larger or smaller territory. Thev will 
treat territorial problems without bias and passion. hey wili scttle 
them peacefully. What is needed to make peace durable is to dethrone 
the despots. This, of course, cannot bc achieved peacefully. It is 
necessary to crush the mercenaries of the kings. But this revolutionary 
war of the peoples against the tyrants will bc the last war, thc war to 
abolish war forever. 


The Econo~nicsof War 

This idea was already dimly present in the minds of the French 
revolutionary leaders when, after having repelled the invading armies 
of Prussia an2 Austria, they embarked upon a campaign of aggression. 
Of course, under the leadership of Napoleon they themseIves very 
soon adopted the most ruthless methods of boundless expansion and 
annexation until a coalition of all European powers frustrated their 
ambitions. But the idea of durable peace was soon resurrected. It was 
one of the main points in the body of nineteenth-century liberalism 
as consistently elaborated in the much abused principles of the Man- 
chester school. 

These British liberals and their continental friends were keen enough 
to realize that what can safeguard durable peace is not simply gov- 
ernment by the people, but government by the people under un-
limited laissez faire. In their eyes free trade, both in domestic affairs 
and in international relations, was the necessary prerequisite of the 
preservation of pcace. In such a world without trade and migration 
barriers no incentives for war and conquest are left. Fullv convinced 
of the irrefutable persuasiveness of the liberal ideas, they dropped 
the notion of the last war to abolish all wars. All peoples will of their 
own accord recognize the blessings of free trade and peace and will 
curb their domestic despots without any aid from abroad. 

Adost historians entirely fail to recogn& the factors which replaced 
the " limited" war of the-ancien rCgime bv the "unlimited" war of our 
age. As they see it, the change came with the shift from the dvnastic 
to the national form of state and was a consequence of the ~rench 
Revolution. They look only upon attending phenomena and confuse 
causes and effects. They speak of the composition of the armies, of 
strategical and tactical principles, of weapons and transportation 
facilities, and of manv other mattcrs of military art and administra- 
tive technicalities.' Nowever, all these things do not explain why 
modern nations prefer agsression to pcace. 

Therc is pcrfcct agreement with regard to the fact that total war 

is an offshoot of aggressive nationalism. But this is merely circular 

reasoning. We call a&essive nationalism that ideology which makes 

for modern total war. Aggressive nationalism is the necessary deriva- 

tive of the policies of interventionism and national planning. While 

laissez faire eIiminates the causes of international conflict, govern- 

ment interference with business and socialism create conflicts for 

I. The best presentation of the traditional interpretation is provided bv the 
book, Makers of Modern Strategy, Military Thought from Machiavelli to Hitler, 
ed. E. M. Earle (Princeton University Press, 1944);cf. especially the contribution 
of R. R. Palmer, pp. 49-53. 

Human Action 

which no peaceful solution can be found. While under free trade 
and freedom of migration no individual is concerned about the ter- 
ritorial size of his country, under the protective measures of economic 
nationaIism nearly every citizen has a substantial interest in these 
territorial jssucs. The enlargement of the territory subject to the 
sovereignty of his own government means material improvement 
for him or at least relief from restrictions which a foreign govern- 
ment has imposed upon his wcll-being. What has transformed the 
limited war betnecn royal armies into total war, the clash between 
peoples, is not technicalities of n~ilitary art, but the substitution of the 
welfare state for the laissez-faire state. 

If Napoleon I had reached his goal, the French Empire would have 
stretched far beyond the limits of r 815. Spain and Naples would have 
been ruled by khgs of the house of Bonaparte-Murat instead of kings 
of another French family, the Bourbons. The palace of Kassel would 
have been occupied by a French playboy instead of one of the 
egregious Electors of the Hcsse family. All these things would not 
have made the citizens of France more prosperous. Neither did the 
citizens of Prussia win anything from the fact that their king in I 866 
evicted his cousins of Hanover, Hessc-Kassel and Nassau from their 
luxurious residences. But if Hitler had realized his plans, the Ger- 
mans expected to enjoy a higher standard of living. They were 
confident that the annihilation of the French, the Poles, and the 
Czechs would make every member of their own race richer. The 
struggle for more Lebensraurn was thcir own war. 

Under laissez faire peaceful coexistence of a multitude of sovereign 
nations is possible. Under government control of business it is im-
possible. The tragic error of President Wilson was that he ignored 
this essential point. Modern total war has nothing in common with 
the limited war of the old dynasties. It is a war against trade and mi- 
gration barriers, a war of th; comparatively overpopulated countries 
against the comparatively underpopulated. It is a war to abolish those 
institutions which prevent the emergence of a tendency toward an 
equalization of wage rates all over the world. It is a war of the farm- 
ers tilling poor soil against those governments which bar them from 
access to much more fertile soil lying fallow. It is, in short, a war of 
wage earners and farmers who describe themselves as underprivileged 
"have-nots7' against the wage earners and farmers of other nations 
whom they consider privileged "haves." 

The acknowledgment of this fact does not suggest that victorious 

wars would really do away with those evils about which the aggres- 

sors complain. Neither does it mean that there can be any question 


The Economics of War 82I 

of appeasing the aggressors by removing migration barriers. As condi- 
tions are today, the Americas and Australia in admitting German, 
Italian, and Japanese immigrants would merely open their doors to 
the vanguards of hostile armies. 

It is futile to place confidence in treaties, conferences, and such 
bureaucratic outfits as the League of Xations and the United Nations. 
Plenipotentiaries, office clerks and experts make a poor show in fight- 
ing idcologjes. The spirit of conquest cannot be smothered by red 
tape. What is needed is a radical change in ideologies and economic 
policies. 

2. War and the Market Economy 
The market economy, say the socialists and the interventionists, is 
at best a system that may be tolerated in peacetime. But when war 
comes, such indulgence is impermissible. It would jeopardize the 
vital interests of the nation for the sole benefit of the selfish concerns 
of capitalists and entrepreneurs. War, and in any case modern total 
war, peremptorily rcquires government control of business. 

Hardly anybody has been bold enough to challenge this dogma. 
It served in both World Wars as a convenient pretext for innumerable 
measures of government intcrfercnce with business which in many 
countries step by step led to full "war socialism." When the hostilities 
ceased, a new slogan was launched. The period of transition from war 
to peace and of "reconversion," people contended, requires even 
more government control than the period of war. Besides, why should 
one ever return to a social system which can work, if at all, only in 
the interval between two wars? The most appropriate thing would 
be to cling permancntly to government controI in order to be duly 
preparcd for any possible emergency. 

An examination of the problems which the United States had to face 

in the second World War will clearly show how fallacious this 

reasoning is. 

What America needed in order to win the war was a radical con- 

version of a11 its production activities. A11 not absolutely indispensable 

civilian consumption was to be climinated. The plants and farms were 

henceforth to turn out only a miniinurn of goods for nonmilitary use. 

For the rest, they were to devote themselves completely to the task 

of supplying the armed forces. 

The realization of this program did not require the establishment 

of controls and priorities. If the government had raised all the funds 

needed for thc conduct of war by taxing the citizens and by borrow- 

ing from them, everybody would have been forced to cut down his 


Human Action 

consumption drasticalIy. The entrepreneurs and farmers would have 
turned toward production for the government bccause the sale of 
goods to private citizens would have dropped. The government, now 
by virtue of the inflow of taxes and borrowed money the biggest 
buyer on the market, would have been in a position to obtain all it 
wanted. Even the fact that the government chose to finance a consider- 
able part of the war expenditure by increasing the quantity of money 
in circulation and by borrowing from the commercial banks would 
not have altered this state of affairs. The inflation must, of course, 
bring about a marked tendency toward a rise in the prices of all goods 
and services. The government would have had to pay higher nominal 
prices. But it would still have been the most solvent buyer on the 
markct. It would have been possible for it to outbid the citizens who 
on the one hand had not the right of manufacturing the money they 
needed and on the other hand would have been squeezed by enormous 
taxes. 

But the government deliberately adopted a policy which was 
bound to make it impossible for it to rely upon the operation of the 
unhampered market. It resorted to price control and made it illegal 
to raise commodity prices. Furthermore it was very slow in taxing 
the incomes swollen by the inflation. It surrendered to the claim of the 
unions that the workers' real take-home wages should be kept at a 
height which would enable them to preserve in thc war their prewar 
standard of living. In fact, the most numerous class of the nation, 
the class which in peacetime consumed the greatest part of the total 
amount of goods consumed, had so much more money in their pockets 
that their power to buy and to consume was greater than in peace-
time. The wage earners-and to some extent also the farmers and the 
owners of plants producing for the government-would have frus- 
trated the government's endeavors to direct industries toward the 
production of war materials. They would have induced business 
to produce more, not less, of those goods which in wartime are con- 
sidered superfluous luxuries. It was this circumstance that forced the 
Administration to resort to the systems of priorities and of rationing. 
The shortcomings of the methods adopted for financing war ex-
penditure made government control of business necessary. If no 
inflation had been made and if taxation had cut down the income 
(after taxes) of all citizens, not only of those enjoying higher incomes, 
to a fraction of their peacetime revenues, these controls would have 
been supererogatory. The endorsement of the doctrine that the wage 
earners' real income must in wartime be even higher than in peace- 
time made them unavoidable. 


The Economics of War 

Not government decrees and the paper work of hosts of people on 
the government's payroll, but the efforts of private enterprise pro- 
duced those goods which enablcd the American armed forces to win 
the war and to provide all the ~naterial equipment its allies needed for 
their cooperation. The economist does not infer anything from these 
historical facts. But it is expedient to mention them as the interven- 
tionists would have us believe that a decree prohibiting the employ- 
ment of steel for the construction of apartment houses automatically 
produces airplanes and battleships. 

The adjustment of production activities to a change in the demand 
of consumers is the source of profits. The greater the discrepancy 
between the previous state of production activities and that agreeing 
with the new structure of demand, the greater adjustments are re- 
quired and the greater profits are earned by those who succeed best 
in accomplishing these adjustments. The sudden transition from peace 
to war revolutionizes the structure of the market, makes radical re- 
adjustments indispensable and thus becomes for many a source of 
high profits. The planners and interventionists regard such profits 
as a scandal. As they see it, the first duty of government in time of 
war is to prevent the emergence of new millionaires. It is, they say, 
unfair to let some people become richer while other people are killed 
or maimed. 

Nothing is fair in war. It is not just that God is for the big battalions 
and that those who are better equipped defeat poorly equipped ad- 
versaries. It is not just that those in the front line shed their life-blood 
in obscurity, while the commanders, comfortably located in head- 
quarters hundreds of miles behind the trenches, gain glory and fame. 
It is not just that John is killed and Mark crippled for the rest of his 
life, while Paul returns home safe and sound and enjoys all the 
privileges accorded to veterans. 

It may be admitted that it is not "fair" that war enhances the 
profits of those entrepreneurs who contribute best to the equipment 
of the fighting forces. But it would be foolish to deny that the profit 
system produces the best weapons. It was not socialist Russia that 
aided capitalist America with lend-lease; the Russians were lamentably 
defeated before American-made bombs fell on Germany and before 
they got the arms manufactured by American big business. The most 
important thing in war is not to avoid the emergence of high profits, 
but to give the best equipment to one's own country's soldiers and 
sailors. The worst enemies of a nation are those malicious demagogues 
who would give their envy precedence over the vital interests of their 
nation's cause. 


Human Action 

Of course, in the long run war and the preservation of the market 
economy are incompatible. Capitalism is essentially a scheme for 
peaceful nations. But this does not mean that a nation which is forced 
to repel foreign aggressors must substitute government control for 
private enterprise. If it were to do this, it would deprive itself of the 

no st efficient means of defense. There is no record of a socialist na- 
tion which defeated a capitalist nation. In spite of their much glori- 
fied war socialism, the Germans wcre dcfeated in both World Wars. 

What the incompatibility of war and capitalism really means is that 
war and high civilization are incompatible. If the efficiency of capi- 
talism is directed by governments toward the output of instruments 
of destruction, the ingenuity of private business turns out weapons 
which arc powerful enough'to destroy everything. What makes war 
and capitalism incompatible with one another is precisely the un- 
paralleled efficiency of thc capitalist mode of production. 

The market economy, subject to the sovereignty of the individual 
consumers, turns out products which make the individual's Iife more 
agreeable. It caters to the individual's demand for rnorc comfort. It 
is this that made capitalism despicable in the eyes of the apostles of 
violence. They worshipcd the "hero," the destroyer and killer, and 
despised the bourgeois and his "peddler mentality" (Sombart). Now 
mankind is reaping the fruits which ripened from the seeds sown by 
these men. 

3. War and Autarky 
If an econon~ically self-sufficient man starts a feud against another 
autarkic man, no specific problems of "war-economy" arise. But if 
the tailor goes to war against the baker, he must henceforth produce 
his bread for himself. If he neglects to do this, he will be in distress 
sooner than his adversary, the baker. For the baker can wait longer 
for a new suit than the tailor can for fresh bread. The economic prob- 
lem of making war is therefore different for thc baker and for the 
tailor. 

The international division of labor was developed under the as- 
sumption that there would no longer bc wars. In the philosophy of 
the Manchester School free trade and peace wcre seen as mutually 
conditiolling one another. The businessmen who made trade interna- 
tional did not consider the possibility of new wars. 

Nor did general staffs and students of the art of warfare pay any 
attention to the change in conditions which international division of 
labor brought about. The method of military science consists in 
examining the experience of wars fought in the past and in abstracting 


The Economics of War 

82j 

general ruIes from it. Even the most scrupulous occupation with the 
campaigns of Turenne and Napoleon I could not suggest the existence 
of a problem which was not present in ages in which there was prac- 
tically no international division of labor. 

The European military experts slighted the study of the American 
Civil War. In their eyes this war was not instructive. It was fought by 
armies of irregulars led by nonprofessional commanders. Civilians like 
Ihcoln interfered with the conduct of the operations. Little, they 
believed, could be learned from this experience. But it was in the Civil 
War that, for the first time, prohlems of the interregional division of 
labor played the decisive role. The South was predominantly agri- 
cultural; its processing industries were negligible. The Confederates 
depended on the supply of manufactures from Europe. As the naval 
forces of the Union were strong enough to blockade their coast, they 
soon began to lack needed equipment. 

The Germans in both World Wars had to face the same situation. 
They depended on the supply of foodstuffs and raw materials from 
overseas. But they could not run the British blockade. In both wars 
the outcome was decided by the battles of the Atlantic. The Germans 
lost because they failed ii their efforts to cut off the British Isles 
from access to the u.orld market and could not themselves safe-guard 
their own maritime supply lines. The strategicaI problem was deter- 
mined by the conditions of the international division of labor. 

The German warmongers were intent upon adopting policies 
which, as they hoped, could make it possible for Germany to wage 
a war in spite of the handicap of the foreign trade situation. Their 
panacea was Ersatz, the substitute. 

A substitute is a good which is either less suitabIe or more expensive 
or both less suitable and more expensive than the proper good which 
it is designed to replace. Whenever technology succeeds in manu-
facturing or discovering something which is either more suitable or 
cheaper than the thing previously used, this new thing represents a 

-.

techriologicai innovation; ic is improvement and not Ersatz. Ine es- 
sentiaI feature of Ersatz, as this term is employed in the economico- 
military doctrine, is inferior quality or higher costs or both t~gether.~ 

The Wehr~~.irtschuftslehre,

the German doctrine of the economics 
of war, contends that neither cost of production nor quality are im- 
portant in matters of warfare. Profit-seeking business is c'oncerned 
with costs of production and with the quality of the products. But 

2. In this sense wheat produced, under the protection of an import duty, within 
the Reich's territory is Ersatz too: it is produced at higher costs than foreign 
wheat. The notion of Ersatz is a catallactic notion, and must not be defined with 
regard to technological and physical properties of the articles. 

Hzmnn Action 

the heroic spirit of a superior race does not care about such specters 
of the acquisitive mind. What counts alone is war preparedness. A 
warlike nation must aim at autarky in order to be independent of 
foreign trade. It must foster the production of substitutes irrespective 
of marnmonist considerations. It cannot do without full government 
controI of production because the selfishness of the individual citizens 
would thwart the plans of the leader. Even in peacetime the com-
mander-in-chief must be entrusted with economic dictatorship. 

Both theorems of the Ersatz doctrine are falIacious. 

First, it is not true that the quality and suitability of the substitute 
are of no importance. If soldiers are sent into battle badly nourished 
and equipped with weapons made of inferior material, the chances for 
victory are impaired. Their action will be less successful, and they 
will suffer heavier casualties. The awareness of their technical in- 
feriority will weigh on their minds. Ersatz jeopardizes both the 
material strength and the rnorale of an army. 

ATo less incorrect is the theorem that the higher costs of production 
of the substitutes do not count. Higher costs of production mean 
that more labor and more material factors of production must be 
expended in order to achieve the same effect which the adversary, 
producing the proper product, attains with a lower expenditure. It 
is tantamount to squandering scarcc factors of production, material 
and manpower, Such waste under conditions of peace results in lower- 
ing the standard of living, and under conditions of war in cutting 
down the supply of goods needed for the conduct of operations. In 
the present state of technological ltnowledge it is only a slight exag- 
geration to say that everything can be produced out of anything. But 
what matters is to pick out from the great multitude of possible 
methods those with which output is highest per unit of input. Any 
deviation from this principle penalizes itself. The consequences in war 
are as bad as they are in peace. 

In a country like the United States, which depends only to a 
comparatively negligible extent on the importation of raw materials 
from abroad, it is possible to improve the state of war preparedness by 
resorting to the production of substitutes such as synthetic rubber. 
The disadvantageous effects would be small when weighed against the 
beneficial effects. But a country like Germany was badly mistaken in 
the assumption that it could corkper with synthetic gasoline, synthetic 
rubber, Ersatz textiles and Ersatz fats. In both World Wars Germany 
was in the position of the tailor fighting against the man who supplies 
him with bread. With all their brutality the Nazis could not alter this 
fact. 


The Economics of War 

4. The Futility of War 
What distinguishes man from animals is the insight into the advan- 
tages that can be derived from cooperation undcr the division of 
labor. Man curbs his innate instinct of aggression in order to co- 
operate with other human bcings. 'The more he wants to improve 
his material well-being, the more he must expand the system of the 
division of labor. Concomitantly he must more and more restrict the 
sphere in which he resorts to military action. The emergence of the 
international division of labor requires the total abolition of war. Such 
is the essencc of the laissez-faire phiIosophy of Manchestcr. 

This philosophy is, of course, incompatible with statolatry. In its 
context the statc, the social apparatus of violent oppression, is en- 
trusted with the protection of the smooth operation of the market 
economy against the onslaughts of antisocial individuals and gangs. 
Its function is indispensable and beneficial, but it is an ancillary func- 
tion only. There is no reason to idolize the police power and ascribe 
to it omnipotence and omniscicnce. There are things which it can 
certainly not accomplish. It cannot conjure away the scarcity of the 
factors of production, it cannot make people more prosp~rous, it 
cannot raise the productivity of labor. All it can achieve is to prevent 
gangsters from frustrating the efforts of those people who arc intent 
upon promoting materia1 well-being. 

The liberal philosophy of Bentham and Bastiat had not yet com- 
pleted its work of removing trade barriers and government mcddling 
with business when the counterfeit theology of the divine state be- 
gan to take effect. Endeavors to improve the conditions of wage 
earners and small farmers by government decree made it necessary to 
loosen more and more the ties which connected each country's 
domestic economy with thosc of other countries. Economic national- 
ism, the necessary complement of domestic interventionism, hurts 
the interests of foreign peoples and thus creates international con-
flict. It suggests the idea of amending this unsatisfactory state of affairs 
by war. U7hy should a powerfu1 nation tolerate the challenge of a 
less powerful nation? Is it not insolence on the part of small Lap- 
putania to injure the citizens of big Ruritania by customs, migration 
barriers, foreign exchange control, quantitative trade restrictions, 
and expropriation of Ruritanian investments in Lapputania? Would 
it not be easy for the army of Ruritania to crush Lapputania's con- 
temptible forces? 

Such was the ideology of the German, Italian, and Japanese war- 
mongers. It must be adm'itted that they were consistent from the point 


Human Action 

of view of the new "unorthodox" teachings. Interventionism generates 
economic nationalism, and economic nationalism generates bellicosity. 
If men and commodities are prevented from crossing the borderlines, 
why should not the armies try to pave the way for them? 

From the day when Italy, in I 9I I, fell upon Turkey fighting 
was continual. There was airnost always shooting somewhere in the 
world. The peace treaties concluded were virtually merely armistice 
agreements. Moreover they had to do only with the armies of the 
great powers. Some of the smaller nations were always at war. In 
addition there were no less pernicious civil wars and revolutions. 

How far we are today from the rules of international law developed 
in the age of limited warfare! Modern war is merciless, it does not 
spare pregnant women or infants; it is indiscriminate killing and 
destroying. It does not rcspect the rights of neutrals. Millions are 
killed, enslaved, or expelled from the dwelling places in which their 
ancestors lived for centuries. Nobody can foretell what will happen 
in the next chapter of this endless struggle. 

This has nothing to do with the atomic bomb. The root of the 
evil is not the construction of new, more dreadful weapons. It is the 
spirit of conquest. It is probable that scientists will discover sonle 
methods of defense against the atomic bomb. Rut this will not alter 
things, it will merely prolong for a short time the process of the 
con~plete destruction of civilization. 

Modern civilization is a product of the philosophy of laissez faire. 

It cannot be preserved under the ideology of government omnipo- 

tence. Statolatry owes much to the doctrines of Hegel. However, one 

may pass over many of Hegel's inexcusable faults, for Hegel also 

coined the phrase "the futility of victory" (die Ohnrnacht des 

Sieg~s).~

To dcfcat the aggressors is not enough to make peace dur- 
able. The main thing is to discard the ideology that generates war.

XXXV. THE WELFARE PRINCIPLE VERSUS 
THE MARKET PRINCIPLE 

T 
T 
I. The Case Against the Market Economy 
HE objections which the various schools of Sozialpolitik raise 
against the market economy are based on very bad economics. 
They repeat again and again all the errors that the economists long 
ago exploded. They blame the market economy for the consequences 
of the very anticapitalistic poIicies which they themselves advocate 
as necessary and beneficial reforms. They fix on the market economy 
the responsibility for the inevitable failure and frustration of inter- 
ventionism. 
These propagandists must finally admit that the market economy 
is after all not so bad as their "unorthodox" doctrines paint it. It de- 
livers the goods. From day to day it increases the quantity and im- 
proves the quality of products. It has brought about unprecedented 
wealth. But,objects the champion of interventionism, it is deficient 
from what he calls the socia1 point of view. It has not wiped out 
poverty and destitution. It is a system that grants privileges to a 
minority, an upper class of rich people, at the expense of the im- 
mense majority. It is an unfair systetn. The principle of welfare must 
be substituted for that of profits. 
We may try, for the sake of argument, to interpret the concept of 
welfare in such a way that its acceptance by the immense majority 
of nonascetic people would be probable. The better we succeed in 
these endeavors, the more we dcprive the idea of welfare of any con- 
crete meaning and content. It turns into a colorless paraphrase of the 
fundamental category of human action, viz., the urge to rcmove un- 
easiness as far as possible. As it is universally recognized that this 
goal can be more readily, and even exclusively, attained by social 
division of labor, men cooperate within the framework of societal 
bonds. Social man as differentiated from autarkic man must neces- 
sarily modify his original biological indifference to the well-being 
of people beyond his own family. He must adjust his conduct to the 
requirements of social cooperation and look upon his fellow men's 
success as an indispensable condition of his own. From this point of 

Human Action 
view one may describe the objective of socia1 cooperation as the 
realization of the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Hardly 
anybody would venture to object to this definition of the most de- 
sirable state of affairs and to contend that it is not a good thing to see 
as many people as possil~le as happy as possible. All the attacks 
directed against the Bentham formula have centered around ambigui- 
ties or misunderstandings concerning the notion of happiness; they 
have not affected the postulate that the good, whatever it may be, 
should be imparted to the greatest number. 
However, if we interpret welfare in this manner, the concept be- 
comes meaningless. It can be invoked for the justification of every 
variety of social organization. It is a fact that some of the defenders 
of Ncgro slavery contended that slavery is the best means of making 
the Negroes happy and that today in the South many Whites sincerely 
believe that rigid segregation is beneficial no less to the colored man 
than it allegedly is to the white man. The main thesis of racism of the 
Gobineau and Nazi variety is that the hegemony of the superior 
races is salutary to the true interests even of the inferior races. A 
principle that is broad enough to cover all doctrines, however con- 
flicting with one another, is of no use at all. 
But in the mouths of the welfare propagandists the notion of wel- 
fare has a definite meaning. They intentionally employ a term the 
generally accepted connotation of which precludes any opposition. 
No decent man likes to be so rash as to raise objections against the 
realization of weIfare. In arrogating to themselves the exclusive right 
to call their own program the program of welfare, the welfare propa- 
gandists want to triumph by means of a cheap logical trick. They 
want to render their ideas safe against criticism by attributing to 
them an appellation which is cherished by everybody. Their termi- 
nology already implies that all opponents are ill-intentioned scoundrels 
eager to foster their selfish interests to the prejudice of the majority 
of good people. 
The plight of Western civilization consists precisely in the fact that 
serious people can resort to such syllogistic artifices without en-
countering sharp rebuke. There are only two explanations open. 
Either these self-styled welfare economists are themselves not aware 
of the logical inadmissibility of their procedure, in which case they 
lack the indispensable power of reasoning; or they have chosen this 
mode of arguing purposely in order to find shelter for their fallacies 
behind a word which is intendcd beforehand to disarm all opponents. 
In each case their own acts condemn them. 
There is no need to add anything to the disquisitions of the pre- 


Welfare Principle Versus Market Principle 831 

ceding chapters concerning the effects of a11 varieties of intervention- 
ism. The ponderous volumes of welfare economics have not brought 
forth any arguments that could invalidate our conclusions. The only 
task that remains is to examine the critical part of the welfare propa- 
gandists' work, their indictment of the market economy. 

All this passionate talk of the welfare schooI ultimately boils down 
to three points. Capitalism is bad, they say, because there is poverty, 
inequality of incomes and wealth, and insecurity. 

2. Poverty 
Wc may depict conditions of a society of agriculturists in which 
cvcry member tills a piece of land luge enough to provide himself 
and his family with the indispensable necessities of life. We may in- 
clude in such a picture the existence of a few specialists, artisans like 
smiths and professional men like doctors. We may even go further 
and assume that some men do not own a farm, but work as laborers 
on other people's farms. The employer remunerates them for their 
hclp and takes care of them when sickness or old age disables them. 

This schemc of an ideal society was at the bottom of many utopian 
plans. It was by and large realized for some timc in some communities. 
The nearest approach to its realization was probably the common- 
weaIth which the Jesuit padres established in the country which is 
today Paraguay. There is, however, no need to examine the merits 
of s&h a system of social organization. Historical evohtion burst it 
asunder. Its frame was too narrow for the number of people who are 
living today on the carth's surface. 

The inhcrent weakness of such a society is that the increase in 

population must result in progressive poverty. If the estate of a de- 

ceased farmer is divided among his children, the holdings finally be- 

come so small that they can no longer provide sufficient sustenance 

for a family. Everybody is a landowner, but everybody is extremely 

poor. Conditions as they prevaiI in large areas of China provide a sad 

illustration of the misery of the tillers of small parcels. The alternative 

to this outcome is the emergence of a huge mass of landless prole- 

tarians. Then a wide gap separatcs the disinherited paupers from the 

fortunate farmers. They are a class of pariahs whose very existence 

presents society with an insoluble problem. They search in vain for 

a livelihood. Socicty has no use for them. They are destitute. 

When in the ages preceding the rise of modern capitalism the 

statesmen, philosophers, and laws referred to the poor and to the 

problems of poverty. they meant these supernumerary wretches. 


Human Action 

Laissez faire and its off-shoot, industrialism, converted the ernploy- 
able poor into wage earners. In the unhampered market society there 
are people with higher and people with lower incomes. Therk are 
no longer men who, although able and ready to work, cannot find 
regular jobs because there is no room left for them in the social system 
of production. But liberalism and capitalism were evcn in their hey- 
day limited to comparatively small areas of Western and Central 
Europe, Sorth America, and Australia. In the rest of the world 
hundreds of millions still vegetate on the verge of starvation. They 
are poor or paupers in the old sense of the term, supernumerary and 
superfluous, a burden to themselves and a latent threat to the minority 
of their more lucky fellow citizens. 

The penury of these miserable masses of-in the main colored- 
people is not caused by capitalism, but by the absence of capitalism. 
But for the triumph of laissez faire, the lot of the peoples of Western 
Europe would have been evcn worse than that of the coolies. What 
is wrong with Asia is that the per capita quota of capital invested is 
extremely low when compared with the capital equipment of the 
West. The prevailing ideology and the socia1 system which is its 
off-shoot check the evolution of profit-seeking entrepreneurship. 
There is very little domestic capital accumulation, and manifest 
hostility to foreign investors. In many of these countries the increase 
in population figures even outruns the increase in capital available. 

It is false to blame the European powers for the poverty of the 

masses in their colonial empires. In investing capital the foreign rulers 

did all they could do for an improvement in material well-being. It 

is not the fault of the Whites that the Oriental peoples are reluctant to 

abandon their traditional tenets and abhor capitalism as an alien 

ideology. They will very soon have succeeded in freeing themselves 

entirely from foreign domination. Then they will probably turn 

toward various brands of regimentation and totalitarianism. These 

will not solve their economic problems and will not make their masses 

more prosperous. 

As far as there is unhampered capitalism, there is no longer any 

question of poverty in the sense in which this term is applied to the 

conditions of a noncapitalistic society. The increase in population 

figures does not create supernumerary mouths, but additional hands 

whose employment produces additional wealth. There are no able- 

bodied paupers. Seen from the point of view of the economically 

bacltward nations, the conflicts between "capital" and "labor" in the 

capitalist countries appear as conflicts within a privileged upper class. 

In the eyes of an Indian or a Chinese coolie the American automobile 


Welfare Principle Versus Market Principle 833 

worker is an "aristocrat." He is a man who belongs to the 2 per cent 
of the earth's population whose income is highest. Not only the 
colored races, but also the Slavs, the Arabs, and some other peoples 
look upon the average income of the citizens of the capitalistic coun- 
tries-about r z or I 5 per cent of the total of mankind-as a curtail- 
ment of their own material w-ell-being. They fail to realize that the 
prosperity of these allegedly privileged groups is, apart from the 
effects of migration barriers, not paid for by their own poverty, and 
that the main obstacle to the improvement of their own conditions is 
their abhorrence of capitalism. 

Within the frame of capitalism the notion of poverty refers only 
to those people who arc unable to take care of themselves. Even if 
we disregard the case of children, we must realize that there will al- 
ways be such unemployables. Capitalism, in improving the masses' 
standard of living, hygienic conditions, and methods of prophylactics 
and therapeutics, does not remove bodily incapacity. It is true that 
today many people who in the past would have been doomed to 
life-long disability are restored to fulI vigor. But on the other hand 
many whom innate defects, sickness, or accidents would have ex- 
tinguished sooner in earlier days survive as permanently incapacitated 
people. Moreover, the prolongation of the average length of life tends 
toward an increase in the number of the aged who are no longer able 
to earn a living. 

The problem of the incapacitated is a specific problem of human 
civilization and of society. Disabled animals must perish quickly. They 
either die of starvation or fa11 prey to the foes of their species. Savage 
man had no pity on those who were substandard. With regard to 
them many tribes practiced those barbaric methods of ruthless extirpa- 
tion to which the Nazis resorted in our time. The very existence of 
a comparatively great number of invalids is, however paradoxical, 
a characteristic mark of civilization and material well-being. 

Provision for those invalids who lack means of sustenance and are 
not taken care of by thcir next of kin has long been considered a work 
of charity. The funds needed have sometimes been provided by 
governments, more often by voluntary contributions. The Catholic 
orders and congregations and some Protestant institutions have ac- 
complished marvels in collecting such contributions and in using them 
properly. Today there are also many nondenominational establish- 
ments vying with them in noble rivalry. 

The charity system is criticized for two defects. One is the paucity 
of the means available. However, the more capitaIism progresses and 
increases wealth, the more sufficient become the charity funds. On 


Human Action 

the one hand, people are more ready to donate in proportion to the 
improvement in their own well-being. On the other hand, the number 
of the needy drops concomitantly. Even for those with moderate 
incomes the opportunity is offered, by !aving and insurance policies, 
to provide for accidents, sickness, old age, the education of their 
children, and the support of widows and orphans. It is highly probable 
that the funds of the charitable institutions would be sufficient in 
the capitalist countries if interventionism were not to sabotage the 
essential institutions of the market economy. Credit expansion and 
inflationary increase of the quantity of money frustrate the "common 
man's" attempts to save and to accumuIate reserves for less propitious 
days. But the other procedures of interventionisn~ are hardly less 
injurious to the vital interests of the wage earners and salaried em- 
ployees, the professions, and the owners of small-size business. The 
greater part of those assisted by charitable institutions are needy only 
because interventionism has made them so. On the other hand, in- 
flation and the endeavors to lower the rate of interest below the po- 
tential market rate virtually expropriate the endowments of hospitals, 
asylums, orphanages, and similar establishments. As far as the welfare 
propagandists lament the insufficiency of the funds available for 

assistance, they lament one of the results of the policies that they 
theinselves are advocating. 

The second defect charged to the charity system is that it is charity 
and compassion only. The indigent has no claim to the kindness shown 
to him. He depends on the mercy of benevolent people, on the feel- 
ings of tenderness which his distress arouses. What he receives is a 
voluntary gift for which he must be grateful. To be an almsman is 
shameful and humiliating. It is an unbearable condition for a self- 
respecting man. 

These complaints are justified. Such shortcomings do indeed inhere 
in a11 kinds of charity. It is a system that corrupts both givers and 
receivers. It makes thk former self-righteous and the latter submissive 

. . . .

c-qiiig. is mcnealitj~of a capitalistic en-
vironment that makes people feel the indignity of giving and re- 
ceiving alms. Outside of the field of the cash nexus and of deals 
transacted between buyers and sellers in a purely businesslilte manner, 
all interhuman relations arc tainted by the same failing. It is pre- 
cisely the absence of this personal element in market transactions that 
all those deplore who blame capitalism for hard-heartedness and 
callousness. In the eyes of such critics cooperation under the do ut 
des principle dehumanizes a11 societal bonds. It substitutes contracts 
for brotherly love and readiness to help one another. These critics 


Welfare Principle Versus Market Principle 835 

indict the legal order of capitalism for its neglect of the "human 
side." They are inconsistcnt when they blame the charity system for 
its reliance upon feelings of mercy. 

Feudal society was founded on acts of grace and on the gratitude of 
those favored. 'The mighty overlord bestowed a benefit upon the 
vassal and the latter owed hirn personal fideIity. Conditions were 
human in so far as the subordinates had to kiss their superiors' hands 
and to show allegiance to them. In a feudal environment the element 
of grace inhcrent in charitable acts did not give offense. It agreed with 
the generally accepted idcology and practice. It is only in the setting 
of a society based entirely upon contractual bonds that the idea 
emerged of giving to the indigent a legal claim, an actionable titlc to 
sustenance against society. 

The metaphysical arguments advanced in favor of such a right to 
sustenance are based on thc doctrine of natural right. Before God or 
nature all men are equal and endowed with an inalienable right to 
live. Eiowever, the reference to inborn equality is certainly out of 
place in dealing with the eRects of inborn inequality. It is a sad fact 
that physical disability prevents many people from playing an active 
role in social cooperation. It is the operation of the laws of nature 
that makes these people outcasts. They are stepchildren of God or 
nature. We may fully endorse the religious and ethical precepts that 
declare it to be man's duty to assist his unlucky brethren whom nature 
has doomed. But the recognition of this duty does not answer the 
question concerning what methods should be resorted to for its 
performance. It does not enjoin the choice of methods which would 
endanger society and curtail the productivity of human effort. hTeither 
the able-bodied nor the incapacitatcd would derive any benefit from 
a drop in thc quantity of goods available. 

The problems involvcd arc not of a praxeological character, and 
economics is not called upon to providc the best possible solution for 
them. They concern pathology and psychology. They refer to the 
biological fact that the fear oi penury and of the degrading conse- 
quences of being supported by charity are important factors in the 
preservation of man's physiolbgica~ equilibrium. Thcy impel a man 
to keep fit, to avoid sickness and accidents, and to recover as soon as 
possible from injuries suffered. The cxpericnce of thc social security 
systern, especially that of the oldest scheme, the German, has clearly 
shown the undesirable effects resuIting from the elimination of the& 
in~entives.~

No civilized community has callously allowed the in- 

I. Cf.Sulzbach, Gennan Experience with Social insurance (New York, 19471, 
pp. 22-32. 


Human Action 

capacitated to perish. But the substitution of a legally enforceable 
claim to support or sustenance for charitable relief does not seem to 
agree with human nature as it is. Not metaphysical prepossessions, but 
considerations of practical expediency make it inadvisable to promul- 
gate an actionable right to sustenance. 

It is, moreover, an illusion to believe that the enactment of such 
laws can free the indigent from the degrading features inherent in 
receiving alms. The more openhanded these laws are, the more punc- 
tilious must their application become. The discretion of bureaucrats 
is substituted for the discretion of people whom an inner voice drives 
to acts of charity. MJhether this change renders the lot of those in- 
capacitated any easier, is hard to say. 

3. Inequality 
The inequality of incomes and wealth is an inherent feature of the 
market economy. Its elimination would entirely destroy the market 
economy." 

What thosc people who ask for equality have in mind is always an 
increase in their own power to consume. In endorsing the principle 
of equality as a political postulate nobody wants to share his own 
income with those who have less. When the American wage earner 
refers to equality, he means that the dividends of the stockholders 
should be given to him. He does not suggest a curtailment of his 
own income for the benefit of thosc 95 per cent of the earth's popula- 
tion whose income is lower than his. 

The role that income inequality plays in the market society must 
not be confused with the role it plays in a feudal society or in other 
types of noncapitalistic societie~.~ 

Yet in the course of historical evolu- 
tion this precapitalistic inequality was of momentous importance. 

Let us compare the history of China with that of England. China 
has developed a very high civilization. Two thousand years ago it 
was far ahead of England. But at the end of the nineteenth century 
England was a rich and civilized country while China was poor. 
Its civilization did not differ much from the stage it had already 
reached ages before. It was an arrested civilization. 

China had tried to realize the principle of income equality to a 
greater extent than did England. Land holdings were divided and 
subdivided. There was no class of landless proletarians. But in eight- 
eenth-century England this class was very numerous. For a very long

Welfare Principle Versus Market Principle 

time the restrictive practices of nonagricultural business, sanctified 
by traditional ideologies, delayed the emergence of modern entrepre- 
neurship. But when the laissez-faire philosophy had opened the way 
for capitalism by utterly destroying the fallacies of restrictionism, 
the evolution of industrialism could proceed at an accelerated pace 
because the labor force needed was already available. 

What generated the "machine age" was not, as Sombart imagined, 
a specific mentality of acquisitiveness which one day mysteriously got 
hold of the minds of some people and turned them into "capitalistic 
men." There have always been people ready to profit from better 
adjusting production to the satisfaction of the needs of the public. 
But they were paralyzed by the ideology that branded acquisitiveness 
as immoral and erected institutional barriers to check it. The substitu- 
tion of the laissez-faire philosophy for the doctrines that approved of 
the traditional system of restrictions removed these obstacles to 
material improvement and thus inaugurated the new age. 

The liberal phiIosophy attacked the traditional caste system be- 
cause its preservation was incompatible with the operation of the 
market economy. It advocated the abolition of privileges because it 
wanted to give a free hand to those men who had the ingenuity to 
produce in the cheapest way the greatest quantity of products of 
the best quality. In this negative aspect of their program the utilitar- 
ians and economists agreed with the ideas of those who attacked the 
status privileges from the point of view of an alleged right of nature 
and the doctrine of the equality of all men. Both these groups were 
unanimous in the support of the principle of the equality of all men 
under the law. But this unanimity did not eradicate the fundamental 
opposition between the two lines of thought. 

In the opinion of the natural law school all men are biologically 
equal and therefore have the inalienable right to an equal share in all 
things. The first theorem is manifestly contrary to fact. The second 
theorem leads, when consistently interpreted, to such absurdities that 
its supporters abandon logical consistency altogether and ultimately 
come to consider every institution, however discriminating and in- 
iquitous, as compatible with the inalienable equality of all men. The 
eminent Virginians whose ideas animated the American Revolution 
acquiesced in the preservation of Negro slavery. Thc most despotic 
system of government that history has ever known, Bolshevism, pa- 
rades as the very incarnation of the principle of equality and liberty 
of all men. 

The liberal champions of equality under the law were fuIly aware 
of the fact that men are born unequal and that it is precisely their 


Human Actioa 

inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization. Equality 
under the law was in their opinion not designed to correct the in- 
exorable facts of the universe and to make natural inequality disap- 
pear. It was, on the contrary, the device to secure for the whole of 
mankind the maximum of benefits it can derive from it. Hence no 
man-made institutions should prevent a man from attaining that station 
in which he can best serve his fellow citizens. The liberals approached 
the problem not from the point of view of alleged inalienable rights 
of the individuals, but from the social and utilitarian angle. Equality 
under the law is in their eyes good because it best serves the interests 
of all. It leaves it to the voters to decide who should hold public office 
and to the consumers to decide who should direct production activi- 
ties. It thus eliminates the causes of violcnt conflict and secures a 

steady progress toward a more satisfactory state of human affairs. 

The triumph of this liberal phiIosophy produced all those phenom- 
ena which in their totality are called modern Western civilization. 
However, this new ideology could triumph only within an environ- 
ment in which the ideal of income equality was very weak. If the 
Englishmen of the eighteenth century had been prcoccupied with the 
chimera of income equality, laissez-faire philosophy would not have 
appealed to them, just as it does not appeal today to the Chinese or 
the Mohammedans. In this scnse the historian must acknowledge that 
the ideological heritage of feudalism and the manorial system con- 
tributed to the rise of our modern civilization, howcvcr different it is. 

Those eighteenth-century philosophers who were foreign to the 
ideas of the new utilitarian theory could still speak of a superiority 
of conditions in China and in the Mohammedan countries. They knew, 
it is true, very little about the social structure of the oriental world. 
What they found praiseworthy in the dim reports they had obtained 
was the absence of a hereditary aristocracy and of big land holdings. 
As they fancied it, these nations had succeeded better in establishing 
equality than their own nations. 

Then later in the nineteenth century these claims were renewed 
by the nationalists of the nations concerned. The cavalcade was headed 
by Panslavism, whose champions exalted the eminence of communal 
land tenure as realized in the Russian rnir and artel and in the zadruga 
of the Yugoslavs. With the progress of the semantic confusion which 
has converted the meaning of political terms into their very opposite, 
the epithet "democratic" is now lavishly spent. The Moslem peoples, 
which never knew any form of governmcnt other than unlimited 
absolutism, are called democratic. Indian nationalists take pleasure in 
speaking of traditional Hindu democracy! 


Welfare Prirzciple Versus Market Principle 

Economists and historians are indifferent with regard to all such 
emotional effusions. In describing the civilizations of the Asiatics as 
inferior civilizations they do not express any value jud,ments. They 
merely establish the fact that these peoples did not bring forth those 
ideological and institutional conditions which in the West produced 
that capitalist civilization the superiority of which the Asiatics today 
in~plicitly accept in clamoring at least for its technological and 
therapeutical implements and paraphernalia. It is precisely when one 
recognizes the fact that in the past the culture of many Asiatic peoples 
was far ahead of that of thcir Western contemporaries, that the ques- 
tion is raised as to what causes stopped progress in the East. In the 
case of the Hindu civilization the answer is obvious. Here the iron 
grip of the inflexible caste system stunted individual initiative and 
nipped in the bud every attempt to deviate from traditional standards. 
Rut China and the Mohammedan countries were, apart from the 
slavery of a comparatively small number of people, free from caste 
rigidiiy. They were ruled by autocrats. But the individual subjects 
were equal ukder the autocrat. Even slaves and eunuchs were not 
barred from acccss to the highest dignities. It is this equality before 
the ruler to which people refer today in speaking of the supposed 
democratic customs of these Orientals. 

The notion of the economic equality of the subjects to which these 
peoples and their rulers were committed was not well defined but 
vague. But it was very distinct in one respect, namely, in utterly con- 
demning the accumuIation of a large fortune by any private individual. 
The rulers comidered wealthy subjects a threat to their political 
supremacy. All people, the rulers as well as the ruled, were convinced 
that no man can amass abundant means otherwise than by depriving 
others of what by rights should be!ong to them, and that the riches 
of the wealthy few are the cause of the poverty of the many. The 
position of wealthy husinessrnen was in all oriental countries ex- 
tremely precarious. They were at the mercy of the oficeholders. 
Even lavish bribes failed to protect them against confiscation. The 
whole people rejoiced whenever a prosperous businessman fell victim 
to the envy and hatred of the administrators. 

This antichrematistic spirit arrested the proqress of civilization in 
the East and kept the masses on the verge of starvation. As capital 
accumnlation was checked, there could be no auestion of techno- 
lopica1 improvement. Capitalism came to the East as an imported 
alien ideology, imposed by foreign armies and navies in the shape 
either of colonial domination or of extraterritorial jurisdiction. These 
violent methods were certainly not the appropriate means to change 


Human Action 
the traditionalist mentality of the Orientals. But acknowledgment of 
this fact does not invalidate the statement. that it was the abhorrence 
of capital accumulation that doomed many hundreds of millions of 
Asiatics to poverty and starvation. 
The notion of equality which our contemporary welfare propa- 
gandists have in mind is the replica of the ~siatic-idea of equality. 
While vague in every other respect, it is very clear in its abomination 
of large fortunes. It objects to big business and great riches. It advo- 
cates various measures to stunt the growth of individual enterprises 
and to bring about more equality by confiscatory taxation of incomes 
and estates. And it appeals to the envy of the injudicious masses. 
The immediate cconomic consequences of confiscatory policies 
have been dealt with alread~.~ 

It is obvious that in the long run such 
poIicies must result not only in slowjng down or totally checking the 
further accumulation of capital, but also in the consumption of capita1 
accumulated in previous days. They would not only arrest further 
progress toward more rnateiial prosperity, but even reverse the trend 
and bring about a tendency toward progressing poverty. The ideals 
of Asia would triumph; and finally East and West would meet on an 
equal IeveI of distress. 

The welfare school pretcnds not only to stand for the interests of 
the whole of society as against the selfish interests of profit-seeking 
business; it contends moreover that it takes into account the lasting 
secular interests of the nation as against the short-term concerns of 
speculators, promoters, and capitalists who are exclusively committed 
to profiteering and do not bother about the future of the whole of 
society. This second claim is, of course, irreconcilable with the 
emphasis laid by the school upon short-run policies as against long- 
run concerns. fiowever, consistency is not one of the virtues of the 
welfare doctrinaires. Let us for the sake of argument disregard this 
contradiction in their statements and examine them without reference 
to their inconsistency. 

Saving, capital accumulation, and investment withhold the amount 

concerned from current consumption and dedicate it to the improve- 

ment of future conditions. The saver foregoes the increase in present 

satisfaction in order to improve his own well-being and that of his 

family in the more distant future. His intentions are certainly selfish 

in the popuIar connotation of the term. But the effects of his selfish 

conduct are beneficial to the lasting secular interests of the whole 

of society as we11 as of all its members. His conduct produces all 

those phenomena to which even the most bigoted welfare propa- 

4. Cf.above, pp. 800-805. 

Welfare Principle Versus Market Principle 

gandist attributes the epithets economic improvement and progress. 

The policies advocated by the welfare school remove the incentive 
to saving on the part of private citizens. On one hand, the measures 
directed toward a curtailment of big incomes and fortunes seriously 
reduce or destroy entirely the wealthier people's power to save. On 
the other hand, the sums which people with moderate incomes pre- 
viously contributed to capital accumulation are manipulated in such 
a way as to channel them into the lines of consumption. When in the 
past a man saved by entrusting money to a savings bank or by taking 
out an insurance policy, the bank or the insurance company invested 
the equivalent. Even if the saver at a later date consumed the sums 
savcd, no disinvestment and capital consumption resulted. The total 
investments of the savings banks and the insurance companies steadily 
increased in spite of these withdrawals. 

Today there prevails a tendency to push the banks and the insurance 
companies more and more toward investment in government bonds. 
The funds of the social security institutions completely consist in 
titles to the public debt. As far as public indebtedness was incurred by 
spending for current expenditure, the saving of the individual does 
not result in capital accumulation. While in the unhampered market 
economy saving, capital accumulation, and investment coincide, in 
the interventionist economy the individual citizens7 savings can be 
dissipated by the government. The individal citizen restricts his cur- 
rent consumption in order to provide for his own future; in doing this 
he contributes his share to the further economic advancement of 
society and to an improvement of his fellow men's standard of living. 
But the government steps in and removes the socially beneficial effects 
of the individuals7 conduct. Kothing explodes better than this ex- 
ample thc welfare clichC that contrasts the selfish and narrow-minded 
individual, exclusively committed to the enjoyment of the pleasures 
of the moment and having no regard for the well-being of his fellow 
men and for the perennial concerns of society, and the far-sighted 
benevolent government, unflaggingly devoted to the promotion of the 
lasting welfare of the whole of society. 

The welfare propagandist, it is true, raises two objections. First, 
that the individual's motive is selfishness, while the government is 
imbued with good intentions. Let us admit for the sake of argument 
that individuals are devilish and rulers angelic. But what counts in 
life and reality is-whatever Kant may have said-not good intentions, 
but accomplishments. n7hat makes the existence and the evolution of 
society possible is precisely the fact that peaceful cooperation under 
the social division of labor in the long run best serves the selfish con- 


Human Action 

cerns of all individuals. The eminence of the market society 1s that its 
whole functioning and operation is the consummation of this prin- 
ciple. 

The second objection points out that under the welfare system 
capital acoumu2ation by the government and public investment are 
to be substituted for private accumulation and investment. It refers 
to the fact that not all the funds which governmcnts borrowed in the 
past were spent for current expenditure. A considerable part was 
invested in the construction of roads, railroads, harbors, airports, 
power stations, and other public works. Another no less conspicuous 
part was spent for waging wars of defense which admittedly could 
not be financed by other methods. The objection, however, misses 
the point. What matters is that a part of the individual's saving is em- 
ployed by government for current consumption, and that nothing 
hinders the government from so increasing this part that it in fact 
absorbs the whole. 

It is obvious that if governmcnts make it in~possible for their 
subjects to accumulate and to invest additional capital, responsibiIity 
for the formation of new capital, if there is to be any, devolves upon 
govcrnment. The welfare propagandist, in whose opinion government 
control is a synonym for Cod's providential care that wisely and 
imperceptibly leads mankind to higher and more perfect stages of an 
inescapable evolutionary progress, fails to see the intricacy of the 
problem and its ramifications. 

Not only further saving and accumulation of additional capitaI, but 
no less the maintenance of capital at its present level, require curtailing 
today's consumption in order to be more amply supplied later. It is 
abstinence, a refraining from satisfactions which could be reaped 
in~tantly.~

The market economy brings about an environment in 
which such abstinence is practiced to a certain extent, and in which 
its product, the accumulated capital, is invested in those Iines in which 
it best satisfies the most urgent needs of the consumers. The questions 
arise whether government acculnulation of capital can be substituted 
for private accumulation, and in what way a govcrnment would in- 
vest additional capital accumulated. These problems do not refer only 
to a socialist commonwealth. They arc no less urgcnt in an interven- 

5. To establish this fact is, to he sure, not an endorsement of the theories which 
tried to describe interest as the "reward" of abstinence. There is in the world of 
reality no mythical agency that rewards or punishes. What originary interest 
redly is has been shown above in Chapter XIX. But as against the would-be 
ironies of Lassalle (Herr Rastiat-Schulze von Delitzsch in Gesan?melte Rcden and 
Schriften, ed. Bernstein, V,167)~reiterated by innumerable textbooks, it is good 
to emphasize that saving is privation (Entbehmng) in so far as it deprives the 
saver of an instantaneous enjoyment. 

Welfwe P'rinciple Versus Marhet Principle 

tionist scheme that has either totally or almost totally removed the 
conditions making for private capital formation. Even the United 
States is manifestly more and more approaching such a state of 
affairs. 

Let us consider the case of a government that has got control of the 
employment of a considerable part of the citizens' savings. The in- 
vestments of the social security system, of the private insurance com- 
panies, of savings banks, and of commercial banlrs are to a great extent 
determined by the authorities and channeled into the public dcbt. 
The private citizens are still savers. But whether or not their savings 
bring about capital accumulation and thus increasc thc quantity of 
capital goods available for an improvement of the apparatus of pro- 
duction depends on the employment of the funds borrowed by the 
government. If the government squanders thcse sums either by spend- 
ing them for current expcnditure or by malinvcstment, the process of 
capital accun~ulation as inaugurated by the saving of individuals and 
continued by the investment operations of the banks and insurance 
enterprises is cut off. A contrast between thc two ways may clarify 
the matter: 

In the process of the unhampered ~narket economy Bill saves onc 
hundred dollars and deposits it with a savings bank.-1f he is wise in 
choosing a bank which is wise in its lending and investing business, an 
increment in capital results, and brings about a rise in the productivity 
of labor. Out of the surplus thus produccd a part goes to Bill in the 
shape of interest. If Bill blunders in the choice of his bank and entrusts 
his hundred dollars to a bank that fails, he goes emptyhanded. 

In the proccss of government interference with saving and in- 
vestment, Paul in the year 1940 saves by paying one hundred dollars 
to thc national social security instit~tion.~ 

He receives in exchange a 
claim which is virtually an unconditional government IOU. If the 
government spends the hundred dollars for current expenditure, no 
additional capital comcs into existence, and no incrcase in the produc- 
tivity of labor results. The government's IOU is a check drawn upon 
the future taxpayers. In 1970 a certain Peter may have to fulfill the 
government's promise although he himself does not dcrive any benefit 
from thc fact that Pad in 1940 saved one hundred dollars. 

Thus it becomes obvious that therc is no need to look at Soviet 

Russia in ordcr to comprehend the rolc that public finance plays in 

our day. The trumpery argument that thc public debt is no burden 

because "we owe it to ourselves'' is delusive. The Pads of 1940 do not

whether the law obliges his employer to pay it. Cf. above, p. 599. 

Human Action 

owe it to themselves. It is the Peters of 1970 who owe it to the Pauls 
of 1940. The whole system is the acme of the short-run principle. The 
statesmen of I 940 solve their problems by shifting them to the states- 
men of 1970. On that date the statesmen of rgqo will be either dead or 
elder statesmen glorying in their wonderful achievement, social 
security. 

The Santa Clam fables of the welfare school are characterized by 
their con~plete failure to grasp the problems of capital. It is precisely 
this defect that makes it imperative to deny them the appellation we/-
fare economicswith which they describe their doctrines. He who does 
not take into consideration the scarcity of capital goods available is not 
an economist, but a fabulist. He does not deal with reality but with a 
fabulous world of plenty. All the effusions of the contemporary wel- 
fare school are, like those of the socialist authors, based on the implicit 
assumption that there is an abundant supply of capital goods. Then, 
of course, it seems easy to find a rcmedy for all ills, to give to every- 
body "according to his needs" and to make everyone perfectly happy. 

It is true that some of the champions of the welfare school feel 
troubled by a dim notion of the problems involved. They realize that 
capital must be maintained intact if the future productivity of labor is 
not to be irn~aired.~ 

However, these authors too fail to comprehend 
that even the mere maintenance of capital depends on the skillful han- 
dling of the problems of investment, that it is always the fruit of suc- 
cessful speculation, and that endeavors to maintain capital intact pre- 
suppose economic calculation and thereby the operation of the market 
economy. The other welfare propagandists ignore the issue com-
pletely. It does not matter whether or not they endorse in this respect 
the Marxian scheme or resort to the invention of new chimerical no- 
tions such as "the self-perpetuating character" of useful thing~.~ 

In 
any event their teachings are designed to provide a justification for the 
doctrine which blames oversaving and underconsumption for all that 
is unsatisfactory and recommends spending as a panacea. 

When pushed hard by economists, some welfare propagandists and 
socialists admit that impairment of the average standard of living can 
only be avoided by the maintenance of capital already accumulated 
and that economic improvement depends on accumulation of addi- 
tional capital. Maintenance of capital and accumulation of ncw capital, 

7. This refers especially to the writings of Professor A. C. Pigou, thc various 
editions of his book The Economics of Welfare and miscellaneous articles. For a 
critique of Professor Pigou's ideas, cf. Hayek, Profits, Interest and Investment 
(London, 1939). pp. 83-134.

they say, will henceforth be a task of government. They will no 
longer be left to the selfishness of individuals, exclusively concerned 
with their own enrichment and that of their families; the authorities 
will deal with them from the point of view of the common weal. 

The crux of the issue lies precisely in the operation of selfishness. 
Under the system of inequality this selfishness impels a man to save 
and always to invest his savings in such a way as to fill best the most 
urgent needs of the consumers. Cnder the system of equality this 
motive fades. The curtaiIment of consumption in the immediate future 
is a perceptible privation, a blow to the individuals' selfish aims. The 
increment in the supply available in more distant periods of the future 
which is expected from this immediate privation is less recognizable 
for the average intellect. Moreover, its beneficial effects are, under a 
system of public accumulation, so thinly spread out that they hardly 
appear to a man as an appropriate compensation for what he foregoes 
today. The welfare school blithely assumes that the expectation that 
the fruits of today's saving will be reaped equally by the whole of the 
future generation will turn everybody's selfishness'toward more sav- 
ing. Thus they fall prey to a corollary of Plato's illusion that prevent- 
ing people from knowing which children's parents they are will in- 
spire them with parental feelings toward all younger people. It would 
have been wise if the welfare school had been mindful of Aristotle's 
observation that the result will rather be that all parents will be equally 
indifferent to all ~hildren.~ 

The problem of maintaining and increasing capital is insoluble for 
a socialist system which cannot resort to economic calculation. Such 
a socialist commonweaIth lacks any method of ascertaining whether 
its capital equipment is decreasing or increasing. But under intenen- 
tionism and under a socialist system which is still in a position to resort 
to economic calculation on the basis of prices established abroad, 
things are not so bad. Here it is at least possible to comprehend what 
is going on. 

If such a country is under a democratic government, the problems 
of capital preservation and accumulation of additional capital become 
the main issue of political antagonisms. There will be demagogues to 
contend that more could be dedicated to current consumption than 
those who happen to be in power or the other parties are disposed to 
allow. They will always be ready to declare that "in the present 
emergency" there cannot he any question of piling up capital for 
later days and that, on rhe contrary, consumption of a part of the

R,McKeon (New York, I 945), pp. I I 48 f. 

Human Action 

capital already available is fully justified. The various parties will 
outbid one another in promising the voters more government spend- 
ing and at the same time a reduction of all taxes which do not ex- 
clusively burden the rich. In the days of laissez faire people looked 
upon government as an institution whose operation required an 
expenditure of money which must be defrayed by taxes paid by the 
citizens. In the individual citizens' budgets the state was an item of 
expenditure. Today the majority of the citizens look upon govern- 
ment as an agency dispensing benefits. The wagc earners and the 
farmers expect to receive from the treasury more than they con-
tribute to its revenues. The state is in their eyes a spender, not a 
taker. These popular tenets were rationalized and elcvated to the 
rank of a quasi-economic doctrine by Lord Keynes and his disciples. 
Spending and unbalanced budgets are merely synonyms for capital 
consumption. If current expenditure, however beneficial it may be 
considered, is financed by taxing away those parts of higher incomes 
which would have been employed for investment. by inheritance 
taxes, or by borrowing, the governmcnt becomes a factor malting 
for capital consumption. The fact that in present-day America there 
is probably lo still a surplus of annual capita1 accumulation over 
annual capital consumption does not invalidate the statement that 
the total complex of the financial policies of the Federal Government, 
the States, and the municipalities tends toward capital consumption. 

Many who are aware of the undesirable consequences of capital 
consumption are prone to believe that popular government is in- 
compatible with sound financial policies. They fail to realize that not 
democracy as such is to be indicted, but the doctrines which aim 
at substituting the Santa Claus conception of government for the 
night watchman conception derided by Lassalle. What determines 
the course of a nation's economic policies is always the economic 
ideas held by public opinion. 90 government, whether democratic 
or dictatorial, can free itself from the sway of the generally accepted 
ideology. 

Those advocating a restriction of the parliament's prerogatives in 
budgeting and taxation issues or even a complete substitution of 
authoritarian government for representative government are blinded 
by the chimerical image of a perfect chief of state. This man, no less 
benevolent than wise, would be sincerely dedicated to the promotion 
of his subjects' lasting weIfare. The real Fiihrer, however, turns out 
to be a mortaI man who first of a11 aims at the perpetuation of his

inflation and credit expansion. 

Welfare Principle Versus Market Principle 847 

own supremacy and that of his kin, his friends, and his party. As 
far as hc may resort to unpopular measures, he does so for the sake 
of these objectives.' He does not invest and accumulate capital. He 
constructs fortresses and equips armies. 

The much talked about plans of the Soviet and Nazi dictators in- 
volved restriction of current consumption for the sake of "invest- 
ment." The Nazis never tried to suppress the truth that all these 
investments were designed as a preparation for the wars of aggres- 
sion that they planned. The Soviets were less outspoken at the be- 
ginning. But today they proudly declare that all their planning was 
directed by considerations of war preparedness. History does not 
provide any example of capital accumulation brought about by a 
government. As far as governments invested in the construction of 
roads, railroads, and other uscful public works, the capital needed 
was provided by the savings of individual citizens and borrowed b\; 
the government. But the greater part of the public debts was spe& 
for current expenditure. What individuals had saved was dissipated 
by the government. 

Even those who look upon the inequality of wealth and incomes 
as a deplorable thing, cannot deny that it makes for progressing 
capital accumulation. And it is additional capital accumulation alone 
that brings about technological improvement, rising wage rates, and 
a higher standard of living. 

4. Insecurity 
The vague notion of security which the weIfare doctrinaires have 
in mind when complaining about insecurity refers to something like 
a warrant b\; means of which society guarantees to everybody, irre-
spective of his achievements, a standard of living which he considers 
satisfactory. 

Security in this sense, contend the eulogists of times gone by, was 
provided uiidcr +I.,. >Ad! ---.--of the Middle Ages. There is,

Llbc ---... 141111; 

however, no need to enter into an examination of thew claims. Real 
conditions even in the much-glorified thirteenth century were differ- 
ent from the idea1 picture painted by scholastic philosophy; these 
schemes were meant as a description of conditions not as they were 
but as they ought to bc. But even these utopias of the philosophers 
and theologians allow for the existence of a numerous class of desti- 
tute beggars, entirely dependent on alms given by the wealthy. This 
is not precisely the idea of security which the modern usage of the 
term suggests. 


Human Actzon 

The concept of security is the wage earners' and small farmers' 
pendant to the concept of stability heId by the capita1ists.l1 In the 
same way in which capitalists want to enjoy permanently an in- 
come which is not subject to the vicissitudes of changing human 
conditions, wage earners and small farmers want to make their reve- 
nues independent of the market. Both groups are eager to withdraw 
from the flux of historical events. No further occurrcnck should im- 
pair their own position; on the other hand, of course, they do not 
expressly object to an improvement of their material well-being. That 
structure of the market to which they have in the past adjusted their 
activities should never be altered in such a way as to force them to 
a new adjustment. The farmer in a European mountain valley waxes 
indignant upon encountering the competition of Canadian farmers 
producing at iower costs. The house painter boils over with rage 
when the introduction of a new appliance affects conditions in his 
sector of the labor market. It is obvious that the wishes of these 
people could be fulfilled only in a perfectly stagnant world. 

A characteristic feature of the unhampered market society is that 
it is no respecter of vested interests. Past achievements do not count 
if they are obstacles to further improvement. The advocates of se-
curity are therefore quite correct in blaming capitalism for inse- 
curity. But they distort the facts in implying that the selfish interests 
of capitalists and entrepreneurs are responsible. What harms the 
vested interests is the urge of the consumers for the best possible 
satisfaction of their needs. Not the greed of the wealthy few, but 
the propensity of everyone to take advantage of any opportunity 
offered for an improvement of his own well-being makes for producer 
insecurity. What makes the house painter indignant is the fact that 
his fellow citizens prefer cheaper houses to more expensive ones. 
And the house painter himself, in preferring cheaper commodities 
to dearer ones, contributes his share to the emergence of insecurity 
in other sectors of the labor market. 

It is certaidjr true that the necessity to adjus: oneself again aid 
again to changing conditions is onerous. But change is the essence 
of life. In an unhampered market economy the absence of security, 
i.e., the absence of protection for vested interests, is the principle that 
makes for a steady improvement in material well-being. There is no 
need to argue with the bucolic dreams of Virgil and of eighteenth- 
century poets and painters. There is no need to examine the kind of 
security which the real shepherds enjoyed. No one redly wishes 
to change places with them. 

I 1. Cf. above, pp. ~004~9. 


Welfare Principle Versus Market Principle 849 

The longing for security became especially intense in the great 
depression that started in 1929. It met with an enthusiastic response 
from the millions of unemployed. That is capitalism for you, shouted 
the leaders of the pressure groups of the farmers and the wage earners. 
Yet the evils were not created by capitalism, but, on the contrary, 
by the endeavors to "reform" and to "improve" the operation of 
the market economy by interventionism. The crash was the neces- 
sary outcome of the attempts to lower the rate of interest by credit 
expansion. Institutional unemployment was the inevitable result of 
the policy of minimum wage rates. 

5. Social Justice 
In one respect at least present-day welfare propagandists are su- 
perior to most of the older schools of socialists and reformers. They 
no longer stress a concept of social justice with whose arbitrary pre- 
cepts men should comply however disastrous the consequences may 
be. They endorse the utilitarian point of view. They do not oppose 
the principle that the only standard for appreciating social systems 
is judging them with regard to their ability to realize the ends sought 
by acting men. 

However, as soon as they embark upon an examination of the op- 
eration of the market economy, they forget their sound intentions. 
They hold up a set of metaphysical principles and condemn the mar- 
ket economy beforehand because it does not conform to them. They 
smuggle in through a back door the idea of an absolute standard of 
morality which they had barred from the main entrance. In searching 
for remedies against poverty, inequality, and insecurity, they come 
step by step to endorse all the fallacies of the older schools of so- 
cialism and interventionism. They become more and more entangled 
in contradictions and absurdities. Finally they cannot help catching 
at the straw at which all earlier "unorthod~x'~ 

reformers tried to grasp 

-the superior wisdom of perfect rulers. Their last word is always 

state, government, society, or other cleverly designed synonyms for 

the superhuman dictator. 

The welfare school, foremost among them the German Katheder-

sozinlisten and their adepts, the American I~lstitutionalists, have pub- 

lished many thousands of volumes stuffed with punctiliously docu- 

mented information about unsatisfactory conditions. In their opinion 

the colIected materials clearly ilIustratc the shortcomings of capital- 

ism. In truth they merely illustrate the fact that human u.,ants are 

practically unlimited and that there is an immense field open for 


Human Action 

further improvements. They certainly do not prove any of the state- 
ments of the welfare doctrine. 

There is no need to tell us that an ampler supply of various com- 
modities would be welcome to all people. The question is whether 
there is any means of achieving a greater supply other than by in- 
creasing the productivity of labor by the investment of additional 
capital. A11 the babble of the welfarc propagandists aims only at one 
end, namely, obscuring this point, the point that alone matters. While 
the accumulation of additional capital is the indispensable means for 
any further economic progress, these people speak of "oversaving" 
and "overinvestment," of the necessity of spcnding more and of 
restricting output. Thus they are the h&bingers of economic retro- 
gression, preaching a philosophy of decay and social disintegration. 
A society arranged according to their precepts may appear to some 
people as fair from the point of view of an arbitrary standard of 
social justice. But it wiIl certainly be a society of progressing poverty 
for all its members. 

For a century at Ieast public opinion in Western countries has 
been deluded by the idea that there is such a thing as "the social 
question" or "the labor problem." The meaning implied was that the 
very existence of capitaIism hurts the vital interests of the masses, 
especially those of the wage earners and the small farmers. The 
preservation of this manifestly unfair system cannot be tolerated; 
radical reforms are indispensable. 

The truth is that capitalism has not only multiplied population 
figures but at the same time improved the people's standard of Iiv- 
ing in an unprecedented way. Neither economic thinking nor his-
torical experience suggest that any other social system corlld be 
more beneficial to the masses than capitalism. Thc results speak for 
themselves. The market economy needs no apologists and propa- 
gandists. It can apply to itself the words of Sir Christopher Wren's 
epitaph in St. Paul's: Si nzonzmzentmz requiris, circu7nspice.l"

XXXVI. THE CRISIS OF INTERVENTIONISM 
r. The Harvest of Interventionism 
T 
T
HE interventionist: policies as practiced for many decades by all 
governments of the capitalistic West have brought about all 
those effects which the economists predicted. There are wars and 
civil wars, ruthless oppression of the masses by clusters of self- 
appointed dictators, economic depressions, mass unemployment, capi- 
tal consumption, famines. 

However, it is not these catastrophic events which have led to 
the crisis of interventionism. The interventionist doctrinaires and 
their followers explain all these undesired consequences as the un- 
avoidable features of capitalism. As they see it, it is precisely these 
disasters that clearly denlonstrate thc necessity of intensifying inter- 
ventionism. The failures of the interventionist policies do not in the 
least impair the popularity of the implied doctrine. They arc so in- 
terpreted as to strengthen, not to lessen, the prestige of these teach- 
ings. As a vicious economic thcory cannot be simply refuted by 
historical experience, the interventionist propagandists have been 
able to go on in spite of all the havoc they have spread. 

Yet the age of interventionism is reaching its end. Interventionism 
has exhausted all its potentialities and must disappear. 

2. The Exhaustion of the Reserve Fund 
The idea underlying all interventionist policies is that the higher 
inromp and wea!th nf the mere &luefit prt sf the pepu!adm is a 
fund which can be freely used for the improvement of the conditions 
of the less prosperous. The essence of the interventionist policy is 
to take from one group to give to another. It is confiscation and dis- 
tribution. Every measure is ultimately justified by declaring that it 
is fair to curb the rich for the benefit of the poor. 

In the field of public finance progressive taxation of incomes and 
estates is the most characteristic manifestation of this doctrine. Tax 
the rich and spend the revenue for the improvement of the condi- 
tion of the poor, is the principle of contemporary budgets. In the 


Human Actio~ 

field of industrial relations shortening the hours of work, raising 
wages, and a thousand other measures are recommended under the 
assumption that they favor the employee and burden the employer. 
Every issue of government and community affairs is dealt with ex- 
clusively from the point of view of this principle. 

An illustrative example is provided by the methods applied in the 
operation of nationalized and municipalized enterprises. These enter- 
prises very often result in financial failure; their accounts regularly 
show losses burdening the state or the city treasury. It is of no use 
to investigate whether the deficits are due to the notorious inefficiency 
of the public conduct of business enterprises or, at least partly, to 
the inadequacy of the prices at which the commodities or services 
are sold to the customers. What matters more is the fact that the tax- 
payers must cover these deficits. The interventionists fully approve 
of this arrangement. They passionately reject the two other possible 
solutions: selling the enterprises to private entrepreneurs or raising 
the prices charged to the customers to such a height that no further 
deficit remains. The first of these proposals is in their eyes mani- 
festly reactionary because the inevitable trend of history is toward 
more and more socialization. The second is deemed "antisocial" be- 
cause it places a heavier load upon the consuming masses. It is fairer 
to make the taxpayers, i.e., the wealthy citizens, bear the burden. 
Their ability to pay is greater than that of the average people riding 
the nationalized railroads and the municipalized subways, trolleys, 
and busses. To ask that such public utilities should be self-supporting, 
is, say the interventionists, a relic of the old-fashioned ideas of ortho- 
dox finance. One might as well aim at making the roads and the public 
schools self-supporting. 

It is not necessary to argue with the advocates of this deficit policy. 
It is obvious that recourse to this ability-to-pay principle depends 
on the existence of such incomes and fortunes as can still be taxed 
away. It can no longer be resorted to once these extra funds have 
been exhausted by taxes and other interventionist measures. 

This is precisely the present state of affairs in most of the Euro-
pean countries. The United States has not yet gone so far; but if 
the actual trend of its economic policies is not radically altered very 
soon, it will be in the same condition in a few years. 

For the sake of argument we may disregard aI1 the other conse- 

quences which the fulI triumph of the ability-to-pay principle must 

bring about and concentrate upon its financial aspects. 

The interventionist in advocating additional public expenditure is 

not aware of the fact that the funds available are limited. He does not 


The Crisis of Interventionism 

853 


realize that increasing expenditure in one department enjoins restrict- 
ing it in other departments. In his opinion there is plenty of money 
available. The income and wealth of the rich can be freely tapped. 
In recommending a greater allowance for the schools he simply 
stresses the point that it would be a good thing to spend more for 
education. He does not venture to prove that to raise the budgetary 
allowance for schools is more expedient than to raise that of an-
other department, e.g., that of health. It never occurs to him that 
grave arguments could be advanced in favor of restricting public 
spending and lowering the burden of taxation. The champions of 
cuts in the budget are in his eyes merely the defenders of the mani- 
festly unfair class interests of the rich. 

With the present height of income and inheritance tax rates, this 
reserve fund out of which the interventionists seek to cover all pub- 
lic expenditure is rapidly shrinking. It has practically disappeared 
altogether in most European countries. In the United States the re- 
cent advances in tax rates produced only negligible revenue results 
beyond what would be produced by a progression which stopped 
at much lower rates. High surtax rates for the rich arc very popdar 
with interventionist dilettantes and demagogues, but they secure only 
modest additions to the revenue.l From day to day it becomes more 
obvious that large-scale additions to the amount of public expendi- 
ture cannot be financed by "soaking the rich," but that the burden 
must be carried by the masses. The traditional tax policy of the age 
of interventionism, its glorified devices of progressive taxation and 
lavish spending, have been carried to a point at which their ab-
surdity can no longer be concealed. The notorious principle that, 
whereas private expenditures depend on the size of income available, 
public revenues must be regulated according to expenditures, refutes 
itself. Henceforth, governments will have to realize that one dolIar 
cannot be spent twice, and that the various items of government ex- 
penditure are in conflict with one another. Every penny of addi-

I. In the United States the surtax rate under the 1942 Act was 52 per cent on the 
taxable income bracket $zz,ooo-26,000. If the surtax had stopped at this level, the 
loss of revenue on 1942 income would have been about $249 million or 2.8 per cent 
of the total individual income tax for that year. In the same year the total net in- 
comes in the income classes of $~o,ooo and above was $8,91z million. Complete 
confiscation of these incomes would not have produced as much revenuc as was 
obtained in this year from all taxable incomes, namely, $9,046 million. Cf. A Tax

foot the bill themselves for the subsidies. The deficits of publicly 
owned and operated enterprises will be charged to the bulk of the 
population. 

The situation in the employer-employee nexus will be analogous. 
'The popular doctrine contends that wage earners are reaping "social 
gains" at the expense of the unearned income of the exploiting classes. 
The strikers, it is said, do not strike against the consumers but against 
"matiagement." There is no reason to raise the prices of products when 
labor costs are increased; the difference must be borne by employers. 
But when more and more of the share of the entreprene;rs and capi- 
talists is absorbed by taxes, higher wage rates, and other "social gains" 
of employees, and by price ceilings, nothing remains for such a buffer 
function. Then it becomes evident that every wage raise, with its 
whole momentum, must atiect the prices of the products and that 
the social gains of each group fully correspond to the social Iosses 
of the other groups. Every strike becomes, even in the short run and 
not only in the long run, a strike against the rest of the people. 

An essential point in the social philosophy of interventionism is the 
existence of an inexhaustible fund which can be squeezed forever. 
The whole doctrine of interventionisin collapses when this fountain 
is drained off. The Santa Claus principle liquidates itself. 

3. The End of Interventionism 
The interventionist interlude must come to an end because inter- 
ventionism cannot lead to a permanent systenl of social organization. 
The reasons are threefold. 

First: Restrictive measures always restrict output and the amount 
of goods available for consumption. Whatever arguments may be 
advanced in favor of definite restrictions and prohibitions, such meas-
ures in themselves can never constitute a system of social production. 

Second: All varieties of interference with the market phenomena 

not only fail to achieve the ends aimed at by their authors and sup- 

porters, but bring about a state of affairs which-from the point of 

view of their authors' and advocates' valuations-is Iess desirable 

than the previous state of affairs which they were designed to alter. 

If one wants to correct their manifest unsuitablencss and preposter- 

ousness by supplementing the first acts of intervention with more 

and more of such acts, one must go farther and farther until the 

market economy has been entirely destroyed and socialism has been 

substituted for it. 

Third: Interventionism aims at confiscating the "surplus" of one 


The Cl'isis of l~zte~ventionisnz 

855 


part of the population and at giving it to the other part. Once this 
surplus is exhausted by total confiscation, a further continuation of 
this policy is impossible. 

Marching ever further on the way of interventionism, first Ger- 
many, then Great Britain and many other European countries have 
adopted central planning, the Hindenburg pattern of socialism. It is 
noteworthy that in Germany the deciding measures wcre not re- 
sorted to by the Nazis, but some timc before Hitler seized power by 
Briining, the Catholic Chancellor of the Weimar Republic, and in 
Great Britain not by the Labor Party but by the Tory Prime Minister 
Mr. Churchill. The fact has been purposely obscured by the great 
sensation made in Great Britain about the nationalization of the Bank 
of England, the coal mines, and other enterprises. However, these 
seizures were of subordinate importance only. Great Britain is to 
be called a socialist country not because certain enterprises have been 
formally cxpropriatcd and nationalized, but because all the economic 
activities of all citizens are subject to full control by the government 
and its agencies. The authorities direct the allocation of capita1 and 
of rnanpowcr to the various branches of 'business; they cletcrmine 
what should be ~roduced and in what quality and quantity, and 
they assign to each consumer a definite ration. Supremacy in all eco- 
nomic matters is exclusivcly vested in the government. The people 
are reduced to the status of wards. To the businessmen, the former 
entrepreneurs, merely quasi-managerial functions are left. All that 
they are free to do is to carry into effect the entrepreneurial decisions 
of the authorities within a ieatly delimited narrow field. 

It has been shown that the managerial system, i.e., the assign- 
ment of ancillary tasks in the conduct of business to responsible help- 
ers to whom a ccrtajn amount of discretion can be granted, is pos- 
sible only within the frame of the profit system.' What characterizes 
the manager as such and imparts to him a condition different from 
that of the mere technician is that, within the sphere of his assign- 
ment, he himself determines the methods by which his actions should 
conform to the profit principle. In a socialist system in which there 
is neither economic calculation nor capital accounting nor profit 
computation, there is no room left for managerial activities either. 
Rut as long as a socialist commonwealth is stilI in a position to caI- 
culate on the ground of prices determined on foreign markets, it 
can also utiIizc a quasi-managerial hierarchy to some extent. 

It is a poor makeshift to call any age an age of transition. In the 
living world there is alwavs change. Every age is an age of transition, 

2. Cf.above, pp. ;or-pj. 

Hunzan Action 

We may distinguish between social systems that can last and such 
as arc inevitably transitory because they are self-destructive. It has 
already been pointed our in what sense interventionism liquidates it- 
self and must lead to socialism of the German pattern. Most of the 
European countries have already reached this phase, and nobody 
knows whether or not the United States will follow suit. But as long 
as the United States clings to the marltet economy and does not adopt 
the system of full government control of business, the socialist econo- 
mies of Western Europe will still be in a position to calculate. Their 
conduct of business still lacks the characteristic feature of socialist 
conduct; it is still based on economic calculation. It is therefore in 
every respect very different from what it would become if all the 
world were to turn toward socialism. 

It is often said that one half of the world cannot remain com- 
mitted to the market economy when the other half is socialist, and 
vice versa. However, there is no reason to assume that such a partition 
of the earth and the coexistence of the two systems is impossible. 
If this is really the case, then the present economic system of the 
countries that have discarded capitalism may go on for an indefinite 
period of time. Its operation may result in social disintegration, chaos, 
and misery for the peoples. But neither a low standard of living nor 
progressive impoverishment automatically liquidates an economic sys- 
tern. It gives way to a more efficient system only if people themselves 
are intelligent enough to comprehend the advantages such a change 
might bring them. Or it may be destroyed by foreign invaders pro- 
vided with bctter military equipment by the greater efficiency of their 
own economic system. 

Optimists hope that at least those nations which have in the past 
devcloped the capitalist marltet economy and its civilization will 
cling to this system in the future too. There are certainly as many 
signs to confirm as to disprove such an expectation. It is vain to 
speculate about the outcome of the great ideological conflict between 
the principles of private ownership and public ownership, of indi- 
vidualisnl and totalitarianism, of freedom and authoritarian regi- 
mentation. All that we can know beforehand about the re-
sult of this struggle can be condensed in the following three state- 
ments: 

I. We have no knowledge whatever about the existence and op- 
eration of agencies which would bestow final victory in this clash 
on those ideologies whose application will secure the preservation and 
further intensification of societal bonds and the improvement of man- 
kind's material well-being. Nothing suggests the belief that progress 

The Crisis of Irzterventionism 

toward more satisfactory conditions is inevitable or a relapse into 
very unsatisfactory conditions impossible. 

2. Men must choose between the market economy and sociaIism. 
They cannot evade deciding between these alternatives by adopting 
a "middle-of-the-road" position, whatever name they may give to it. 
3. In abolishing econon~ic calculation the generai adoption of so- 
cialism would result in complete chaos and the disintegration of 
social cooperation under the division of Iabor.

XXSVII. THE NONDESCRIPT CHARACTER OF 

ECONOMICS 

I. The Sitlgularity of Econonlics 
W 
W
~IATassigns economics its peculiar and uniquc position in the 
orbit borh of pure knowledge and of the practical utilization 
of knowledge is the fact that its particular theorems are not open 
to any verification or falsification on the ground of experience. Of 
course, a measure suggested by sound economic reasoning rcsults 
in producing the effects ainlcd at, and a measure suggested by faulty 
economic reasoning fads to produce the ends sought. But such cxperi- 
ence is always still historical experience, ie., the expericnce of com- 
plex phenomena. It can never, as has been pointed out, prove or dis- 
prove any particular theorem.' The appIication of spurious ccononlic 
theorems results in undesircd consequences. But these effects never 
have that undisputable pomcr of conviction which the experimental 
facts in the ficld of the natural sciences provide. The ultimate yard- 
stick of an economic theorem's correctncss or jncorrectncss is soIcly 
reason unaided by expericnce. 

The ornillous import of this state of affairs is that it prevents the 
naive mind from recognizing the reality of the things economics 
deals with. "Real" is, in the cycs of man, all that hc cannot alter and 
to whosc existence he must adjust his actions if he wants to attain 
his cnds. The cognizance of reality is a sad experience. It teaches the 
limits on the satisfaction of one's wishes. Only reluctantly does man 
resign himself to the insight that there arc things, viz., the whole 
complex of all causal relations between events, which wishful think- 
ing cannot alter. Yet sense expericnce speaks an easily perceptible 
language. There is no use arguing about experiments. The reality of 
experimentally established facts cannot be contested. 

But in the ficld of praxeological knowledge neither success nor fail- 
ure speaks a distinct language audible to everybody. The experience 
derived exclusively from complex phenomena does not bar escape 
into interpretations based on wishful thinking. The na'ive man's 
propensity to ascribe omnipotence to his thoughts, however confused 

I. Cf.above, pp. 31-32. 

The Nondescript Character of Economics 

859 

and contradictory, is never manifestly and unambiguously falsified 
by experience. The economist can never refute the economic cranks 
and quacks in the way in which the doctor refutes the medicine man 
and the charlatan. History speaks only to those people who know 
how to interpret it on the ground of correct theories. 

2. Economics and Public Opinion 
The significance of this fundamental epistemological difference 
becomes clear if we realize that the practical utilization of the teach- 
ings of economics presupposes their endorsement by public opinion. 
In the market economy the realization of technological innovations 
does not require anything more than the cognizance of their reason- 
ableness by one or a few enlightened spirits. No dullness and clumsi- 
ness on the part of the masses can stop the pioneers of improvement. 
There is no need for them to win the approval of incrt people before- 
hand. They are free to embark upon their projects even if everyone 
else laughs at them. Later, when the new, better, and cheaper products 
appear on the market, these scoffers will scramble for them. How- 
ever dull a man may be, he knows how to tell the difference between 
a cheaper shoe and a more expensive one, and to appreciate the useful- 
ness of new products. 

But it is different in the field of social organization and economic 
policies. Here the best theories are useless if not supported by public 
opinion. They cannot work if not accepted by a majority of the 
people. Whatever the system of government may be, there cannot 
be any question of ruling a nation lastingly on the ground of doc- 
trines at variance with public opinion. In the end the philosophy of 
the majority prevails. In the long run there cannot be any such 
thing as an unpopular system of government. The difference between 
democracy and despotism does not affect the final outcome. It refers 
only to the method by which the adjustment of the system of gov- 
ernment to the ideology held by public opinion is brought about. 
Unpopular autocrats can only be dethroned by revolutionary up- 
heavals, while unpopular democratic rulers are peacefully ousted in 
the next election. 

The supremacy of public opinion determines not only the singular 

role that economics occupies in the complex of thought and knowl- 

edge. It determines the whole process of human history. 

The customary discussions concerning the role the individual plays 

in history miss the point. Everything that is thought, done and ac- 

complished is a performance of individuals. New ideas and innova- 


Human Actiort 

tions are always an achievement of uncommon men. But these great 
men cannot succeed in adjusting social conditions to their plans 
if they do not convince public opinion. 

The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the in- 
tellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and 
economic theories, and the ability of these or other men to make 
these ideologies palatable to the majority. 

3. The Illusion of the Old Liberals 
The masses, the hosts of common men, do not conceive any ideas, 
sound or unsound. They only choose between the ideologies de- 
veloped by the intellectual leaders of mankind. But their choice is 
final and determines the course of events. If they prefer bad doc- 
trines, nothing can prevent disaster. 

The social philosophy of the Enlightenment failed to see the 
dangers that the prevalence of unsound ideas could engender. The 
objections customarily raised against the rationalism of the classical 
economists and the utilitarian thinkers are vain. But there was one 
deficiency in their doctrines. They blithely assumed that what is rea- 
sonable will carry on merely on account of its reasonableness. They 
never gave a thought to the possibility that public opinion could 
favor spurious ideologies w-hose realization would harm welfare and 
well-being and disintegrate social cooperation. 

It is fashionable today to disparage those thinkers who criticized 
the liberal philosophers' faith in the common man. Yet, Burke and 
Haller, Bonald and de Allaistre paid attention to an essential problem 
which the liberals had neglected. They were more realistic in the 
appraisal of the masses than their adversaries. 

Of course, the conservative thinkers labored under the illusion that 
the traditional system of paternal government and the rigidity of eco- 
nomic institutions could be preserved. They were full of praise for 
the ancien regime which had made people prosperous and had even 
humanized war. But they did not see that it was precisely these 
achievements that had increased population figures and thus created 
an excess population for which there was no room left in the old 
system of economic restrictionism. They shut their eyes to the growth 
of a class of people which stood outside the pale of the social order 
they wanted to perpetuate. They failed to suggest any solution to 
the most burning problem with which mankind had to cope on the 
eve of the "Industrial Revolution." 

Capitalism gave the world what it needed, a higher standard of liv- 


The Nondescript Character of Economics 86I 

ing for a steadily increasing number of people. But the liberals, the 
pioneers and supporters of capitalism, overlooked one essential point. 
A social system, however beneficial, cannot work if it is not sup- 
ported by public opinion. They did not anticipate the success of the 
anticapitaljstjc propaganda, After having nullified the fable of the 
divine rnission of anointed kings, the liberals fell prey to no less illu- 
sory doctrines, to the irresistible power of reason, to the infallibility 
of the volonte' gkstkale and to the divine inspiration of majorities. In 
the long run, they thought, nothing can stop the progressive improve- 
ment of social conditions. In unmasking age-old superstitions the 
philosophy of the EnIightenment has once and for all established the 
supremacy of reason. The accompIishments of the policies of free- 
dom will provide such an overwhelming demonstration of the bless- 
ings of the new ideology that no intelligent man will verlture to ques- 
tion it. And, implied the philosophers, the immense majority of people 

are intelligent and able to think correctly. 

It never occurred t6 the old liberals that the majority could in-
terpret historical experience on the ground of other philosophies. 
They did not anticipate the popularity which ideas that they would 
have called reactionary, superstitious, and unreasonable acquired in 
the nineteenth and twenticth centuries. They were so fully imbued 
with the assumption that all men are endoked with the faculty of 
correct reasoning that they entirely misconstrued the meaning of 
the portcnts. As they saw it, all these unpleasant events were tem- 
porary relapses, accidental episodes to which no importance could 
be attached by the philosopher looking upon tnanltind's history sub 
specie aeternitatis. Whatever the reactionaries might say, there was 
one fact which thcy would not be able to deny; namely, that capital- 
ism provided for a rapidly increasing population a steadily improving 
standard of living. 

It is precisely this fact that the immense majority did contest. The 

essential point in the teachings of all socialist authors, and especially 

in the teachings of Marx, is the doctrine that capitalism results in a 

progressive pauperization of the working masses. With regard to the 

capitalistic countries the fallacy of this theorem can hardly be ig- 

nored. With rcgard to the backward countries, which were only 

superficially affected by capitalism, the unprecedented increase in 

population figures does not suggest the interpretation that: the masses 

sink deepcr and deeper. These countries are poor when compared 

with the more advanced countries. Their poverty js the outcome of 

the rapid growth of population. These peoples have preferred to rear 

more progeny instead of raising the standard of living to a higher 


Hunzam Action 

level. That is their own affair. But the fact remains that they had the 
wealth to prolong the average length of life. It would have been im- 
possible for them to bring up more children if the means of sustenance 
had not been increased. 

Nonetheless not only the Marxians but many allegedly "bourgeois" 
authors assert that hlarx's anticipation of capitalist evolution has been 
by and large verified by the history of the last eighty years. 


XXXVIII. THE PIACE OF ECONOMICS IN LEARNING 
I. The Study of Economics 
T 
T
HE naturaI sciences are ultimately based on the facts as estab- 
lished by laboratory experiment. Physical and biological the- 
ories are confronted with these facts, and are rejected when in con- 
flict with them. The perfection of these theories no less than the 
improvement of technological and therapeutical procedures requires 
more and better laboratory research. These experimental ventures 
absorb time, painstaking effort of specialists, and costly expenditure 
of material. Research can no longer be conducted by isolated and 
penniless scientists, however ingenious. The seat of experimentation 
today is in the huge laboratories supported by governments, universi- 
ties, endowments, and big business. Work in these institutions has 
developed into professional routine. The majority of those employed 
in it are technicians recording those facts which the pioneers, of whom 
some are themselves experimenters, will one day use as building stones 
for their theories. As far as the progress of scientific theories is con- 
cerned, the achievements of the rank-and-file researcher are only 
ancillary. But very often his discoveries have immediate practical 
results in improving the methods of therapeutics and of business. 

Ignoring the radical epistemological difference between the natural 
sciences and the sciences of human action, people believe that what 
is needed to furthcr economic knowledge is to organize economic 
research according to the well-tried methods of the institutes for 
medical, physical, and chemical research. Considerable sums of money 
have been spent for what is labeled economic research. In fact the 
subject matter of the work of all these institutes is recent economic 
history. 

It is certainly a laudable thing to encourage the study of economic 
history. However instructive the result of such studies may be, one 
must not confuse them with the study of econon~ics. They do not 
produce facts in the sense in which this term is applied with regard 
to the events tested in laboratory experiments. They do not deliver 
bricks for the construction of a posteriori hypotheses and theorems. 
On the contrary, they are without meaning if not interpreted in the 


864 Hzman Action 

light of theories developed without reference to them. There is no 
need to add anything to what has been said in this respect in the 
preceding chapters. No controversy concerning the causes of a his- 
torical event can be solved on the ground of an examination of the 
facts which is not guided by definite praxeological theories1 

The foundation of institutes for cancer research can possibly con- 
tribute to the discovery of methods for fighting and preventing this 
pernicious disease. But a business cycle research institute is of no 
help in endeavors to avoid the recurrence of depressions. The most 
exact and reliable assemblage of all the data concerning economic 
depressions of the past is of little use for our knowledge in this field. 
Scholars do not disagree with regard to these data; they disagree 
with regard to the theorems to be resorted to in their interpretation. 

Still more important is the fact that it is impossible to collect the 
data concerning a concrete event without reference to the theories 
held by the historian at the very outset of his work. The historian 
does not report all facts, but only those which he considers as rele- 
vant on the ground of his theories; he omits data considered irrelevant 
for the interpretation of the events. If he is misled by faulty theories, 
his report becomes clumsy and may be almost worthless. 

Even the most faithful examination of a chapter of cconomic his- 
tory, though it be the history of the most recent period of the past, 
is no substitute for economic thinking. Economics, like logic and 
mathematics, is a display of abstract reasoning. Economics can never 
be experimental and empirical. The economist does not need an ex- 
pensive apparatus for the conduct of his studies. What he needs is 
the power to think clearly and to discern in the wilderness of events 
what is essential from what is merely accidental. 

There is no conflict between cconomic history and economics. 
Every branch of knowledge has its own merits and its own rights. 
Economists have never tried to belittle or deny the significance of 
economic history. Neither do real historians object to the study of

the socialists and interventionists who could not refute the objections 
raised against their doctrines by the economists. The Historical School 
and the Institutionalists tried to displace econonlics and to substitute 
"empirical" studies for it precisely because they wanted to silence 
the economists. Economic history, as they planned it, was a means

The Place of Economics in Learning 

of destroying the prestige of economics and of propagandizing for 
interventionism. 

2. Economics as a Profession 
The early economists devoted themselves to the study of the prob- 
lems of economics. In lecturing and writing books they were eager 
to communicate to their fellow citizens the results of their thinking. 
They tried to influence public opinion in order to make sound poli- 
cies prevail in the conduct of civic affairs. They never conceived of 
economics as a profession. 

The development of a profession of economists is an offshoot of 
interventionism. The professional economist is the specialist who is 
instrumental in designing various measures of government interfer- 
ence with business. He is an expert in the field of economic legislation, 
which today invariably aims at hindering the operation of the un- 
hampered market economy. 

There are thousands and thousands of such professional experts 
busy in the bureaus of the governments and of the various political 
parties and pressure groups and in the editorial offices of party news- 
papers and pressure group periodicals. Others are employed as ad- 
visers by business or run independent agencies. Some of them have 
nation-wide or even world-wide reputations; many are among the 
most influential men of their country. It often happens that such ex- 
perts are called to direct the affairs of big banks and corporations, are 
elected into the legislature, and are appointed as cabinet ministers. 
They rival the legal profession in the supreme conduct of political 
affairs. The eminent role they play is one of the most characteristic 
features of our age of interventionism. 

There can be no doubt that a class of men who are so preponderant 
includes extremely talented individuals, even the most eminent men 
of our age. But the philosophy that guides their activities narrows 
their horizon. By virtue of their connection with definite parties 
and nress~regroupsi eager to acq~ir~ privileges, the..

~n~rigl became 

I -----r---Y 

one-sided. They shut their eyes to the remoter consequences of the 
policies they are advocating. With them nothing counts but the short- 
run concerns of the group they are serving. The ultimate aim of their 
efforts is to make their clients prosper at the expense of other people. 
They are intent upon convincing themselves that the fate of man-
kind coincides with the short-run interests of their group. They try 
to sell this idea to the public. In fighting for a higher price of silver, 
of wheat, or of sugar, for higher wages for the members of their 


Human Action 

union, or for a tariff on cheaper foreign products, they claim to 
be fighting for the supreme good, for liberty and justice, for their 
nation's flowering, and for civilization. 

The public looks askance upon the lobbyists and blames them for 
the dismal features of interventionist legislation. However, the seat 
of the evil is much deeper. The philosophy of the various pressure 
groups has penetrated the legislative bodies. There are in the present- 
day parliaments representatives of wheat growers, of cattle breeders, 
of farmers' cooperatives, of silver, of the various labor unions, of in- 
dustries which cannot stand foreign competition without tariffs, and 
of many other pressure groups. There are few for whom the nation 
counts more than their pressure group. The same holds true for the 
departments of the administration. The cabinet minister of agricul- 
ture considers himself the champion of the interests of farming; his 
main objective is to make food prices soar. The minister of labor 
considers himself the advocate of labor unions; his foremost aim is 
to make the unions as formidable as possible. Each department fol- 
lows its own course and works against the endeavors of the other 
departments. 

Many people complain today about the lack of creative statesman- 
ship. However, under the predominance of interventionist ideas, a 
political career is open only to men who identify themselves with 
the interests of a pressure group. The mentality of a union leader 
or of a secretary of farmers' associations is not what is required for a 
far-sighted statesman. Service to the short-run interests of a pressure 
group is not conducive to the development of those qualities which 
make a great statesman. Statesmanship is invariably long-run policy; 
but pressure groups do not bother about the long run. The lamentable 
failure of the German Weimar system and of the Third Republic in 
France was primarily due to the fact that their politicians were merely 
experts in pressure group interests. 

l7-

j. rorecasting as a Profession 
When the businessmen finally learned that the boom created by 
credit expansion cannot last and must necessarily Iead to a slump, 
they realized that it was important for them to know in time the 
date of the break. They turned to the economists for advice. 

The economist knows that the boom must result in a depression. 

But he does not and cannot know when the crisis will appear. This 

depends on the special conditions of each case. Many political events 

can influence the outcome. There are no rules according to which 


ThePlace of Economics in Learning 


g67 
the duration of the boom or of the following depression can be 
computed. And even if such rules were available, they would be of 
no use to businessmen. What the individual businessman needs in or- 
der to avoid losses is knowledge about the date of the turning point 
at a time when other businessmen still believe that the crash is farther 
away than is really the case. Then his superior knowledge will give 
him the opportunity to arrange his own operations in such a way as 
ro come out unharmed. But if the end of the boom could be cal- 
culated according to a formula, all businessmen would learn the date 
at the same time. Their endeavors to adjust their conduct of affairs 
to this information would immediately result in the appearance of all 
the phenomena of the depression. It would be too late for any of them 
to avoid being victimized. 
If it were possible to calculate the future structure of the market, 
the future would not be uncertain. There would be neither entrepre- 
neurial loss nor profit. What people expect from the economists is 
beyond the power of any mortal man. 
The very idea that the future is predictable, that some formulas 
could be substituted for the specific understanding which is the es- 
sence of entrepreneurial activity, and that familiarity with these 
formulas could make it possible for anybody to take over the con- 
duct of business is, of course, an outgrowth of the whole complex 
of fallacies and misconceptions which are at the bottom of present- 
day anticapitalistic policies. There is in the whole body of what is 
called the Marxian philosophy not the slightest reference to the fact 
that the main task of action is to provide for the events of an uncertain 
future. The fact that the terms promoter and speculator are today 
used only with an opprobrious connotation clearly shows that our 
contemporaries do not even suspect in what the fundamental prob- 
lem of action consists. 
Entrepreneurial judgment is one of those things that cannot be 
bought on the market. The entrepreneurial idea that carries on and 
brings profit is precisely that ideawhich did not occur to the major- 
ity. It is not correct foresight as such that yields profits, but fore- 
sight better than that of the rest. The prize goes only to those dis- 
senters who do not let themselves be misled by the errors accepted 
by the multitude. What makes profits emerge is the provision for 
future needs for which others have neglected to make adequate pro- 
vision. 
Entrepreneurs and capitalists expose their own material well-being 
if they are fully convinced of the soundness of their plans. They 
would never venture to take their economic life into their hands be- 


Human Action 

cause an expert advised them to do so. Those ignorant people who 
operate on the stock and commodity exchanges according to tips 
are destined to lose their money, from whatever source they may 
have got their inspiration and "inside" information. 

In fact both the economists and the businessmen are fully aware 
of the uncertainty of the future. The businessmen realize that the 
economists do not dispense any reliable information about things to 
come and that all that they provide is interpretation of statistical data 
referring to the past. For the capitalists and entrepreneurs the econo- 
mists' opinions about the future count only as questionable conjec- 
tures. They are skeptical and not easily fooled. But as they quite cor- 
rectly believe that it is useful to know all the data which could possibly 
have any relevance for their affairs, they subscribe to the newspapers 
and periodicals publishing the forecasts. Anxious not to neglect any 
source of information available, big business employs staffs of econo- 
mists and statisticians. 

Business forecasting fails in the vain attempts to make the uncer- 
tainty of the future disappear and to deprive entrepreneurship of its 
inherent speculative character. But it renders very valuable services 
in assembling and interpreting the available data about economic 
trends and developments of the recent past. 

4. Economics and the Universities 
Tax-supported universities are under the sway of the party in 
power. The authorities try to appoint only professors who are ready 
to advance ideas of which they themselves approve. As all nonsocialist 
governments are today firmly committed to interventionism, they 
appoint only interventionists. In their opinion, the first duty of the 
university is to sell the official social philosophy to the rising gen 
erati~n.~

They have no use for economists. 
However, interventionism prevails also at many of the independent 

. .. 

U11IVGlSlLlCb. 

According to an age-old tradition the objective of the universities 
is not only teaching, but also the promotion of knowledge and sci- 
ence. The duty of the university teacher is not merely to hand down 
to the students the complex of knowledge developed by other men. 
He is supposed to contribute to the enlargement of this treasure by 
his own work. It is assumed that he is a full-fledged member of the 

2. G. Santayana, in speaking of a professor of philosophy of the-then Royal 
Pmssian-University of Berlin, observed that it seemed to this man "that a pro- 
fessor's business was to trudge along the governmental towpath with a legal 
cargo." (Persons and Places, [New York, 19451~11, 7.) 

The Place of Economics in Learning 

world-embracing republic of scholarship, an innovator and a pioneer 
on the road toward more and better knowledge. No university would 
admit that the members of its faculty are inferior to anybody in their 
respective fields. Every university professor considers himself equal 
to a11 other masters of his science. Like the greatest of them, he 
too contributes his share to the advancement of learning. 

This idea of the equality of all professors is, of course, fictitious. 
There is an enormous difference between the creative work of the 
genius and the monograph of a specialist. Yet in the field of empirical 
research it is possible to cling to this fiction. The great innovator and 
the simple routinist resort in their investigations to the same tech- 
nical methods of research. They arrange laboratory experiments or 
collect historical documents. The outward appearance of their work 
is the same. Their publications refer to the same subjects and prob- 
lems. They are commensurable. 

It is quite otherwise in theoretical sciences like philosophy and eco- 
nomics. Here there is nothing that the routinist can achieve according 
to a more or less stereotyped pattern. There are no tasks which re- 
quire the conscientious and painstaking effort of. sedulous monog- 
raphers. There is no empirical research; all must be achieved by the 
power to reflect, to meditate, and to reason. There is no specializa- 
tion, as all problems are linked with one another. In dealing with any 
part of the body of knowledge one deals actually with the whole. 
An eminent historian once described the psychological and educa- 
tional significance of the doctoral thesis by declaring that it gives 
the author the proud assurance that there is a little corner, although 
small, in the field of learning in the knowledge of which he is second 
to none. It is obvious that this effect cannot be realized by a thesis 
on a subject of economic analysis. There are no such isolated corners 
in the complex of economic thought. 

There never lived at the same time more than a score of men whose 
work contributed anything essential to economics. The number of 
creative men is as small in economics as it is in other fields of learn- 
ing. Besides, many of the creative economists do not belong to the 
teaching profession. But there is a demand for thousands of uni- 
versity and college teachers of economics. Scholastic tradition re- 
quires that each of them should attest his worth by the publication 
of original contributions, not merely by compiling textbooks and 
manuals. An academic teacher's reputation and salary depend more 
on his literary work than on his didactic abilities. A professor can- 
not help publishing books. If he does not feel the vocation to write 
on economics, he turns to economic history or descriptive economics. 


Human Action 
But then, in order not to lose face, he must insist on the claim that 
the problems he treats are economics proper, not economic history. 
He must even pretend that his writings cover the only legitimate field 
of economic studies, that they alone are empirical, inductive, and 
scientific, while the merely deductive outpourings of the "armchair" 
theorists are idle speculations. If he were to neglect this, he would 
admit that there are among the teachers of economics two classes- 
those who themselves have contributed to the advancement of eco- 
nomic thought and those who have not, although they may have done 
a fine job in other disciplines such as recent economic history. Thus 
the academic atmosphere becomes unpropitious for the teaching of 
economics. Many professors-happily not all of them-are intent 
upon disparaging "mere theory." They try to substitute an unsys- 
tematically assembled collection of historical and statistical informa- 
tion for economic analysis. They dissolve economics into a number 
of integrated branches. They specialize in agriculture, in labor, in 
Latin American conditions, and in many other similar subdivisions. 
It is certainly one of the tasks of university training to make stu- 
dents familiar with economic history in general and no less with 
recent economic developments. But all such endeavors are doomed 
to failure if not firmly grounded upon a thorough acquaintance with 
economics. Economics does not allow of any breaking up into special 
branches. It invariably deals with the interconnectedness of all the 
phenomena of action. The catallactic problems cannot become visible 
if one deals with each branch of production separately. It is impos- 
sible to study labor and wages without studying implicitly com-
modity prices, interest rates, profit and loss, money and credit, and 
all the other major problems. The real problems of the determination 
of wage rates cannot even be touched in a course on labor. There are 
no such things as "economics of labor" or "economics of agriculture." 
There is only one coherent body of economics. 
What these specialists deal with in their lectures and publications 
is noc economics, but the doctrines of the various pressure groups. 
Ignoring economics, they cannot help falling prey to the ideologies 
of those aiming at special privileges for their group. Even those 
specialists who do not openIy side with a definite pressure group and 
who claim to maintain a lofty neutrality unwittingly endorse the 
essential creeds of the interventionist doctrine. Dealing exclusively 
with the innumerable varieties of government interference with busi- 
ness, they do not want to cling to what they call mere negativism. If 
they criticize the measures resorted to, they do it only in order to 
recommend their own brand of interventionism as a substitute for 


The Place of Economcs in Learning 

871 
other people's interventionism. Without a qualm they endorse the 
fundamental thesis of both interventionism and socialism that the un- 
hampered market economy unfairly harms the vital interests of the 
immense majority for the sole benefit of callous exploiters. As they 
see it, an economist who demonstrates the futility of interventionism 
is a bribed champion of the unjust claims of big business. It is im- 
perative to bar such scoundrels from access to the universities and 
their articles from being printed in the periodicals of the associations 
of university teachers. 
The students are bewildered. In the courses of the mathematical 
economists they are fed formulas describing hypothetical states of 
equilibrium in which there is no longer any action. They easily con- 
clude that these equations are of no use whatever for the compre- 
hension of economic activities. In the lectures of the specialists they 
hear a mass of detail concerning interventionist measures. They must 
infer that conditions are paradoxical indeed, because there is never 
equilibrium, and wage rates and the prices of farm products are not 
so high as the unions or the farmers want them to be. It is obvious 
that a radical reform is indispensable. But what kind of reform? 
The majority of the students espouse without any inhibitions the 
interventionist panaceas recommended by their professors. Social 
conditions will be perfectly satisfactory when the government en- 
forces minimum wage rates and provides everybody with adequate 
food and housing, or when the sale of margarine and the importation 
of foreign sugar are prohibited. They do not see the contradictions 
in the words of their teachers, who one day lament the madness of 
competition and the next day the evils of monopoly, who one day 
complain about falling prices and the next day about rising living 
costs. They take their degrees and try as soon as possible to get a 
job with the government or a powerful pressure group. 
But: there are many young men who are keen enough to see through 
the fallacies of interventionism. They accept their teachers' rejection 
of thc niihampereb market economy. Bur they do not beiieve that 
the isolated measures of interventionism could succeed in attaining 
the ends sought. They consistently carry. their preceptors' thoughts 
to their ultimate logical consequences. They turn toward socialism. 
They hail the Soviet system as the dawn of a new and better civiliza- 
tion. 
However, what has made many of the present-day universities 
by and large nurseries of socialism is not so much the conditions pre- 
vailing in the departments of economics as the teachings handed down 
in other departments. In the departments of economics there can 


Human Action 

still be found eminent economists, and even the other teachers are 
familiar with some of the objections raised against the practicability 
of socialism. The case is different with many of the teachers of phi- 
losophy, history, literature, sociology, and political science. They in- 
terpret history on the ground of a garbled vulgarization of dialectical 
materialism. Even many of those who passionately attack Marxism 
on account of its materialism and atheism are under the sway of the 
ideas developed in the Communist Manifesto and in the program of 
the Communist International. They explain depressions, mass un-
employment, inflation, war and poverty as evils necessarily inherent 
in capitalism and intimate that these phenomena can disappear only 
with the passing of capitalism. 

5. General Education and Economics 
In countries which are not harassed by struggles between various 
linguistic groups public education can work very well if it is limited 
to reading, writing, and arithmetic. With bright children it is even 
possible to add elementary notions of geometry, the natural sciences, 
and the valid laws of the country. But as soon as one wants to go 
farther, serious difficulties appear. Teaching at the elementary level 
necessarily turns into indoctrination. It is not feasible to represent to 
adolescents all the aspects of a problem and to let them choose be- 
tween dissenting views. It is no less impossible to find teachers who 
could hand down opinions of which they themselves disapprove in 
such a way as to satisfy those who hold these opinions. The party that 
operates the schools is in a position to propagandize its tenets and 
to disparage those of other parties. 

In the field of religious education the liberals solved this problem 

by the separation of state and church. In liberal countries religion is 

no longer taught in public schools. But the parents are free to send 

their children into denominational schools supported by religious 

communities. 

However, the problem does not refer only to the teaching of re- 

ligion and of certain theories of the natural sciences at variance with 

the Bible. It concerns even more the teaching of history and eco- 

nomics. 

The public is aware of the matter only with regard to the inter- 

national aspects of the teaching of history. There is some talk to- 

day about the necessity of freeing the teaching of history from the 

impact of nationalism and chauvinism. But few people realize that 

the problem of impartiality and objectivity is no less present in deal- 


The Place of Economics in Learning 

ing with the domestic aspects of history. The teacher's or the text- 
book author's own social philosophy colors the narrative. The more 
the treatment must be simplified and condensed in order to be 
comprehensible to the immature minds of children and adolescents, 
the worse are the effects. 

As the Marxians and the interventionists see it, the teaching of his- 
tory in the schools is tainted by the endorsement of the ideas of old 
liberalism. They want to substitute their own interpretation of his- 
tory for the "bourgeois" interpretation. In Marxian opinion the 
English Revolution of 1688, the American Revolution, the great 
French Revolution, and the nineteenth-century revolutionary move- 
ments in continental Europe were bourgeois movements. They re- 
sulted in the defeat of feudalism and in the establishment of bour- 
geois supremacy. The proletarian masses were not emancipated; they 
merely passed from the class rule of the aristocracy to the class rule 
of the capitalist exploiters. To free the working man, the abolition 
of the capitalist mode of production is required. This, contend the 
interventionists, should be brought about by Sozialpolitik or the New 
Deal. The orthodox Marxians, on the other hand, assert that only 
the violent overthrow of the bourgeois system of government could 
effectively emancipate the proletarians. 

It is impossible to deal with any chapter of history without taking 
a definite stand on these controversial issues and the implied eco- 
nomic doctrines. The textbooks and the teachers cannot adopt a 
lofty neutrality with regard to the postulate that the "unfinished 
revolution" needs to be completed by the communist revolution. 
Every statement concerning events of the last three hundred years 
involves a definite judgment on these controversies. One cannot avoid 
choosing between the philosophy of the Declaration of Independence 
and the Gettysburg Address and that of the Conzmunist Manifesto. 
The challenge is there, and it is useless to bury one's head in the sand. 

On the high school level and even on the college level the handing 

d~wiiof historical and economic knowiedge is virtually indoctrina- 

tion. The greater part of the students are certainly not mature enough 

to form their own opinion on the ground of a critical examination of 

their teachers' representation of the subject. 

If public education were more efficient than it really is, the po- 

litical parties would urgently aim at the domination of the school 

system in order to determine the mode in which these subjects are 

to be taught. However, general education plays only a minor role in 

the formation of the political, social, and economic ideas of the ris- 

ing generation. The impact of the press, the radio, and environmental 


Human Action 

conditions is much more powerful than that of teachers and text- 
books. The propaganda of the churches, the political parties, and the 
pressure groups outstrips the influence of the schools, whatever they 
may teach. What is learned in school is often very soon forgotten 
and cannot carry on against the continuous hammering of the social 
milieu in which a man moves. 

6. Economics and the Citizen 
Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices 
and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human 
life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the 
pith of civilization and of man's human existence. 

To mention this fact is not to indulge in the often derided weak- 
ness of specialists who overrate the importance of their own branch 
of knowledge. Not the economists, but all the people today assign 
this eminent place to economics. 

All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called 
economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of 
social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of praxeology 
and economics. Everybody's mind is preoccupied with economic doc- 
trines. Philosophers and theologians seem to be more interested in 
economic problems than in those problems which earlier generations 
considered the subject matter of philosophy and theology. Novels 
and plays today treat all things human-including sex relations-from 
the angle of economic doctrines. Everybody thinks of economics 
whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in 
casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential 
economic theories. 

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries religion was the main 
issue in European political controversies. In the eighteenth and nine- 
teenth centuries in Europe as well as in America the paramount ques- 

+:A" ronmron+a+;rm rrn~mremnnt rrrxrfilnLrn177+:rm T-ArTr

L~WUVY a>Ary~babr~rcruv~w v ~IJUJ IVY a1 avavluuall. I uuaY IL 

r v rsururur 

is the market economy versus socialism. This is, of course, a problem 
the solution of which depends entirely on economic analysis. Re- 
course to empty slogans or to the mysticism of dialectical materialism 
is of no avail. 

There is no means by which anyone can evade his personal re- 
sponsibility. Whoever neglects to examine to the best of his abilities 
all the problems involved voluntarily surrenders his birthright to a 
self-appointed elite of supermen. In such vital matters blind reliance 
upon "experts" and uncritical acceptance of popular catchwords and 


The Place of Econowtics in Learning 

prejudices is tantamount to the abandonment of self-determination 
and to yielding to other people's domination. As conditions are to- 
day, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than 
economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake. 

Very few are capable of contributing any consequential idea to 
the body of economic thought. But all reasonable men are called upon 
to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, 
in our age, the primary civic duty. 

Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot re- 
main an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups 
of scholars and specialists. Economics deals with society's funda- 
mental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the 
main and proper study of every citizen. 

7. Economics and Freedom 
The paramount role that economic ideas play in the determina- 
tion of civic affairs explains why governments, political parties, and 
pressure groups are intent upon restricting the freedom of econpic 
thought. They are anxious to propagandize the "good" doctrine 
and to silence the voice of the "bad" doctrines. As they see it, truth 
has no inherent power which could make it ultimately prevail solely 
by virtue of its being true. In order to carry on, truth needs to be 
backed by violent action on the part of the police or other armed 
troops. In this view, the criterion of a doctrine's truth is the fact 
that its supporters succeeded in defeating by force of arms the cham- 
pions of dissenting views. It is implied that God or some mythical 
agency directing the course of human affairs always bestows victory 
upon those fighting for the good cause. Government is from God 
and has the sacred duty of exterminating the heretic. 

It: is useless to dwell upon the contradictions and inconsistencies 
of this doctrine of intolerance and persecution of dissenters. Never 
befwe has the wor!d known ssch a &vdy sysrem of 

coii~~ived 

propaganda and oppression as that instituted by contemporary gov- 
ernments, parties, and pressure groups. However, all these edifices 
will crumble like houses of cards as soon as a great ideology attacks 
them. 

Not only in the countries ruled by barbarian and neobarbarian 

despots, but no less in the so-called Western democracies, the study 

of economics is practically outlawed today. The public discussiqn of 

economic problems ignores almost entirely all that has been said by 

economists in the last two hundred years. Prices, wage rates, interest 


Hvrnan Action 

rates, and profits are dealt with as if their determination were not 
subject to any law. Governments try to decree and to enforce maxi- 
mum commodity prices and minimum wage rates. Statesmen exhort 
businessmen to cut down profits, to lower prices, and to raise wage 
rates as if these were dependent on the laudable intentions of indi- 
viduals. In the treatment of international economic relations people 
blithely resort to the most nai've fallacies of Mercantilism. Few are 
aware of the shortcomings of all these popular doctrines, or realize 
why the policies based upon them invariably spread disaster. 

These are sad facts. However, there is only one way in which a 
man can respond to them: by never relaxing in the search for truth. 


XXXIX. ECONOMICS AND THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS 
OF HUMAN EXISTENCE 

I. Science and Life 
IT is customary to find fault with modern science because it ab- 

stains from expressing judgments of value. Living and acting man, 
we are told, has no use for Wertfreiheit; he needs to know what he 
should aim at. If science does not answer this question, it is sterile. 
However, the objection is unfounded. Science does not value, but 
it provides acting man with all the information he may need with 
regard to his valuations. It keeps silence only when the question is 
raised whether life itself is worth living. 

This question, of course, has been raised too and will always be 
raised. What is the meaning of all these human endeavors and activi- 
ties if in the end nobody can escape death and decomposition? Man 
lives in the shadow of death. Whatever he may have achieved in the 
course of his pilgrimage, he must one day pass away and abandon 
all that he has built. Each instant can become his last. There is only 
one thing that is certain about the individual's future-death. Seen 
from the point of view of this ultimate and inescapable outcome, all 
human striving appears vain and futile. 

Moreover, human action must be called inane even when judged 
merely with regard to its immediate goals. It can never bring full 
satisfaction; it merely gives for an evanescent instant a partial re- 
moval of uneasiness. As soon as one want is satisfied, new wants spring 
up and ask for satisfaction. Civilization, it is said, makes people 
nnO_rer herniise it mi~ltlpliestheir wishes 21ld &PS net senthe, hut

kindles, desires. All the busy doings and dealings of hard-working 
men, their hurrying, pushing, and bustling are nonsensical, for they 
provide neither happiness nor quiet. Peace of mind and serenity can- 
not be won by action and secular ambition, but only by renuncia- 
tion and resignation. The only kind of conduct proper to the sage 
is escape into the inactivity of a purely contemplative existence. 

Yet all such qualms, doubts, and scruples are subdued by the 
irresistible force of man's vital energy. True, man cannot escape 
death. But for the present he is alive; and life, not death, takes hold 


Humaa Action 

of him. Whatever the future may have in store for him, he cannot 
withdraw from the necessities of the actual hour. As long as a man 
lives, he cannot help obeying the cardinal impulse, the e'lan vital. 
It is man's innate nature that he seeks to preserve and to strengthen 
his life, that he is discontented and aims at removing uneasiness, that 
he is in search of what may be called happiness. In every living be- 
ing there works an inexplicable and nonanalyzable Id. This Id is the 
impulsion of all impulses, the force that drives man into life and 
action, the original and ineradicable craving for a fuller and happier 
existence. It works as long as man lives and stops only with the extinc- 
tion of life. 

Human reason serves this vital impulse. Reason's biological function 
is to preserve and to promote life and to postpone its extinction as 
long as possible. Thinking and acting are not contrary to nature; they 
are, rather, the foremost features of man's nature. The most appro- 
priate description of man as differentiated from nonhuman beings 
is: a being purposively struggling against the forces adverse to his 
life. 

Hence all talk about the primacy of irrational elements is vain. 
Within the universe the existence of which our reason cannot ex- 
plain, analyze, or conceive, there is a narrow field left within which 
man is capable of removing uneasiness to some extent. This is the 
realm of reason and rationality, of science and purposive action. 
Neither its narrowness nor the scantiness of the results man can ob- 
tain within it suggest the idea of radical resignation and lethargy. No 
philosophical subtleties can ever restrain a healthy individual from 
resorting to actions which-as he thinks-can satisfy his needs. It 
may be true that in the deepest recesses of man's soul there is a long- 
ing for the undisturbed peace and inactivity of a merely vegetative 
existence. But in living man these desires, whatever they may be, are 
outweighed by the urge to act and to improve his own condition. 
Once the forces of resignation get the upper hand, man dies; he does 
not rtrninto a plant. 

It is true, praxeology and economics do not tell a man whether 
he should preserve or abandon life. Life itself and the unknown forces 
that originate it and keep it burning are an ultimate given, and as 
such beyond the pale of human science. The subject matter of 
praxeology is merely the essential manifestation of human life, viz., 
action. 


Essential Problems of Human Existence 

2. Economics and Judgments of Value 
While many people blame economics for its neutrality with re- 
gard to value judgments, other people blame it for its alleged in- 
dulgence in them. Some contend that economics must necessarily 
express judgments of value and is therefore not really scientific, as 
the criterion of science is its valuational indifference. Others main- 
tain that good economics should be and could be impartial, and that 
only bad economists sin against this postulate. 

The semantic confusion in the discussion of the problems con-
cerned is due to an inaccurate use of terms on the part of many 
economists. An economist investigates whether a measure a can bring 
about the result p for the attainment of which it is recommended, 
and finds that a does not result in p but in g, an effect which even 
the supporters of the measure a consider undesirable. If this econ- 
omist states the outcome of his investigation by saying that a is a 
bad measure, he does not pronounce a judgment of value. He merely 
says that from the point of view of those aiming at the goal p, the 
measure a is inappropriate. In this sense the free-trade economists at- 
tacked protection. They demonstrated that protection does not, as 
its champions believe, increase but, on the contrary, decreases the 
total amount of products, and is therefore bad from the point of 
view of those who prefer an ampler supply of products to a smaller. 
It is in this sense that economists criticize policies from the point 
of view of the ends aimed at. If an economist calls minimum wage 
rates a bad policy, what he means is that its effects are contrary to 
the purpose of those who recommend their application. 

From the same point of view praxeology and economics look 
upon the fundamental principle of human existence and social evolu- 
tion, viz., that cooperation under the social division of labor is a more 
efficient way of acting than is the autarkic isolation of individuals. 
Praxeology and economics do not say that men should peacefully co- 
operate within the fraiiie of societai bonds; they mereiy say that men 
must act this way if they want to make their actions more successful 
than otherwise. Compliance with the moral rules which the estab- 
lishment, preservation, and intensification of social cooperation re- 
quire is not seen as a sacrifice made to a mythical entity, but as the 
recourse to the most efficient methods of action, as a price ex-
pended for the attainment of more highly valued returns. 

It is against this substitution of an autonomous, rationalistic and 

voluntaristic ethics for the heteronomous doctrines both of intui- 

tionism and of revealed commandments that the united forces of 


Human Action 

all antiliberal schools and dogmatisms direct the most furious attacks 
They all bhme the utilitarian philosophy for the pitiless austerity 
of its description and analysis of human nature and of the ultimatc 
springs of human action. It is not necessary to add anything morc 
to the refutation of these criticisms which every page of this book 
provides. Only one point should be mentioned again, because on the 
one hand it is the acme of the doctrine of all contemporary pied 
pipers and on the other hand it offers to the average intellectual a 
welcome excuse to shun the painstaking discipline of economic studies. 

Economics, it is said, in its rationalistic prepossessions assumes that 
men aim only or first of all at material well-being. Rut in reality men 
prefer irrational objectives to rational ones. They are guided more 
by the urge to realize myths and ideals than by the urge to enjoy 
a higher standard of living. 

What economics has to answer is this: 

I. Economics does not assume or postulate that men aim only or 
first of all at what is called material well-being. Economics, as a branch 
of the more general theory of human action, deals with all human 
action, i.e., with man's purposive aiming at the attainment of ends 
chosen, whatever these ends may be. To apply the concept rational 
or irrational to the ultimate ends chosen is nonsensical. We may call 
irrational the ultimate given, viz., those things that our thinking can 
neither analyze nor reduce to other ultimately given things. Then 
every ultimate end chosen by any man is irrational. It is neither more 
nor less rational to aim at riches like Croesus than to aim at poverty 
like a Buddhist monk. 
2. What these critics have in mind when employing the term 
rational ends is the desire for material well-being and a higher standard 
of living. It is a question of fact whether or not their statement is true 
that men in general and our contemporaries especially are driven 
more by the wish to realize myths and dreams than by the wish to 
improve their material well-being. Although no intelligent being 
could fail to give the correct answer, we may disregard the issue. 
For economics does not say anything either in favor of or against 
myths. It is perfectly neutral with regard to the labor-union doc- 
trine, the credit-expansion doctrine and all such doctrines as far as 
these may present themselves as myths and are supported as myths 
by their partisans. It deals with these doctrines only as far as they 
a;e considered doctrines about the means fit for the attainment 01 
definite ends. Economics does not say labor unionism is a bad myth. 
It merely says it is an inappropriate means of raising wage rates for 
all those eager to earn wages. It leaves it to every man to decide 

881

Essential Problems of Human Existence 

whether the realization of the labor-union myth is more important 
than the avoidance of the inevitable consequences of labor-union 
policies. 

In this sense we may say that economics is apolitical or nonpo- 
litical, although it is the foundation of politics and of every kind of 
political action. We may furthermore say that it is perfectly neutral 
with regard to all judgments of value, as it refers always to means 
and never to the choice of ultimate ends. 

3. Economic Cognition and Human Action 
Man's freedom to choose and to act is restricted in a threefold way. 
There are first the physical laws to whose unfeeling absoluteness man 
must adjust his conduct if he wants to live. There are second the 
individual's innate constitutional characteristics and dispositions and 
the operation of environmental factors; we know that they influence 
both the choice of the ends and that of the means, although our 
cognizance of the mode of their operation is rather vague. There is 
finally the regularity of phenomena with regard to the interconnect- 
edness of means and ends, viz., the praxeological law as distinct from 
the physical and the physiological law. 

The elucidation and the categorial and formal examination of 

this third class of the laws of the universe is the subject matter of 

praxeology and its hitherto best-developed branch, economics. The 

body of economic knowledge is an essential element in the structure 

of human civilization; it is the foundation upon which modern in- 

dustrialism and all the moral, intellectual, technological, and thera- 

peutical achievements of the last centuries have been built. It rests 

with men whether they will make the proper use of the rich treasure 

with which this knowledge provides them or whether they will 

leave it unused. But if they fail to take the best advantage of it and 

disregard its teachings and warnings, they will not annul economics; 

they wiii stamp out society and the human race.
